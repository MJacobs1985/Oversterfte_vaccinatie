RT-PCR"	"Unclear"	""	""	""	"COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; vaccination; naturally acquired immunity; vaccine-induced immunity."	"Background. Waning of protection against infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
conferred by 2 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine begins shortly after inoculation and becomes substantial within 4 months. With that, 
the impact of prior infection on incident SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is unclear. Therefore, we examined the long-term protection of 
naturally acquired immunity (protection conferred by previous infection) compared to vaccine-induced immunity.
Methods. A retrospective observational study of 124 500 persons, compared 2 groups: (1) SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals who 
received a 2-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, and (2) previously infected individuals who have not been vaccinated. Two multivariate logistic regression models were applied, evaluating four SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes—infection, symptomatic disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), hospitalization, and death—between 1 June and 14 August 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel.
Results. SARS-CoV-2-naive vaccinees had a 13.06-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.08–21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to unvaccinated-previously-infected individuals, when the first event (infection or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The increased risk was significant for symptomatic disease as well. When allowing the infection to occur at any time between March 2020 and February 2021, evidence of waning naturally acquired immunity was demonstrated, although SARS-CoV-2 naive vaccinees still had a 5.96-fold (95% CI: 4.85–7.33) increased risk for 
breakthrough infection and a 7.13-fold (95% CI: 5.51–9.21) increased risk for symptomatic disease. Conclusions. Naturally acquired immunity confers stronger protection against infection and symptomatic disease caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 2-dose vaccine-indued immunity.

provinces, and by age group and sex, from January 2010 through March 2021; in 
comparison with data for other countries and their regions or counties.   
We find that there is no extraordinary surge in yearly or seasonal mortality in Canada, 
which can be ascribed to a COVID-19 pandemic; and that several prominent features in 
the ACM/w in the COVID-19 period exhibit anomalous province-to-province 
heterogeneity that is irreconcilable with the known behaviour of epidemics of viral 
respiratory diseases (VRDs). We conclude that a pandemic did not occur. 
In addition, our analysis of the ACM/w, by province, age and sex, allows us to highlight 
anomalies, occurring during the COVID-19 period, which provide strong evidence that: 
• Among the most elderly (85+ years), many died from the immediate response to 
the pandemic that was announced by the WHO on 11 March 2020. 
• Predominantly young males (0-44 years, and also 45-64 years) probably 
indirectly died from the sustained pandemic response, in the summer months of 
2020, and into the fall and winter, starting in May 2020, especially in Alberta, 
significantly in Ontario and British Columbia, whereas not in Quebec. 
Our study provides constraints on the mechanisms at play in VRD epidemics."	""	""	""	"internal-pdf://1576833308/1628290219153_CanadaACMinto2021-article----6dr.pdf"	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""
