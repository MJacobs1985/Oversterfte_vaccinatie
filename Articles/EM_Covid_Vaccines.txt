METHODS: A retrospective analysis examined VAERS reports between 14 December 2020 and 8 October 2021 and focused on AE reports related to COVID-19 vaccines and AE outcomes [e.g., emergency room (ER) visits after being vaccinated, hospitalization, prolongation of existing hospitalization, life-threatening events, disability, birth defect, and death]. Reporting odds ratios (RORs) and Breslow-Day statistics were used to compare AE reporting between COVID-19 and non-COVID vaccines and between individual COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS: A total of 604,157 AEs of COVID-19 vaccines were reported, including 43.51% for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 47.13% for the Moderna vaccine, and 9.12% for the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. About 12.56% of patients visited ER after being vaccinated, 5.96% reported hospitalization, and 1.52% reported life-threatening events. Among the number of death cases (n = 7,674; mean age = 73), 2,025 patients (26.39%) had hypertension and 1,237 (16.12%) patients had cancer. RORs between COVID-19 vaccines and non-COVID vaccines identified increased ROR in ER visits, hospitalization, and life-threatening events. The results of the Breslow-Day statistics indicated heterogeneities between the disproportionality of reports across the four serious AE outcomes (i.e., ER visits, hospitalization, life-threatening events, and disability) between individual COVID-19 vaccines. CONCLUSION: Most current VAERS reports showed that the most commonly reported AEs of COVID-19 vaccines were mild. Cases with a mortality outcome tended to occur in older adults with underneath conditions. Close ongoing surveillance in the safety of COVID-19 vaccines is critical and will inform the use of individual COVID-19 vaccines. Given the known limitations associated with the passive spontaneous reporting system, such as VAERS, our findings need to be further assessed and verified through longitudinal, large healthcare data systems."

Here, we evaluate the cellular immune responses after both SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in patients receiving the anti-CD20 therapy rituximab (RTX) and those with low B cell counts due to common variable immune deficiency (CVID) disease. Assessment of effector and memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 revealed elevated reactivity and proliferative capacity after both infection and vaccination in B cell-deficient individuals, particularly within the CD8(+) T cell compartment, in comparison with healthy controls. Evaluation of clinical outcomes demonstrates that vaccination of RTX-treated individuals was associated with about 4.8-fold reduced odds of moderate or severe COVID-19 in the absence of vaccine-induced antibodies. Analysis of T cell differentiation demonstrates that RTX administration increases the relative frequency of naïve CD8(+) T cells, potentially by depletion of CD8(+)CD20(dim) T cells, which are primarily of an effector memory or terminal effector memory (TEMRA) phenotype. However, this also leads to a reduction in preexisting antiviral T cell immunity. Collectively, these data indicate that individuals with B cell deficiencies have enhanced T cell immunity after both SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination that potentially accounts for reduced hospitalization and severe disease from subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection."

METHODS: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and minimum age of 18 years with 3-month follow-up postdiagnosis between 21 September 2020 and 14 December 2021 were identified from the TriNetX Research Network platform. The primary outcomes consisted of new-onset or persistent symptoms, new-onset diagnoses, and death and were compared between vaccine and no-vaccine groups. RESULTS: At baseline, 1 578 719 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were identified and 1.6% (n = 25 225) completed vaccination. After matching, there were no differences (P > .05) in demographics or preexisting comorbidities. At 28 days following COVID-19 diagnosis, the incidence of hypertension was 13.52 per 1000, diabetes was 5.98 per 1000, thyroid disease was 3.80 per 1000, heart disease was 15.41 per 1000, and mental disorders was 14.77 per 1000 in the vaccine cohort. At 90 days following COVID-19 diagnosis, the relative risk of hypertension was 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], .26-.42), diabetes was 0.28 (95% CI, .20-.38), heart disease was 0.35 (95% CI, .29-.44), and death was 0.21 (95% CI, .16-.27). Differences in both 28- and 90-day risk between the vaccine and no-vaccine cohorts were observed for each outcome, and there was enough evidence (P < .05) to suggest that these differences were attributed to the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that COVID-19 vaccine is protective against PASC symptoms, new onset of health conditions, and mortality."	"2328-8957

However, the association between vaccination status and number of doses and the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, a clinical measure of hypoxemia associated with an increased risk of intensive care treatment and mortality, has not been investigated. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed a consecutive series of 116 patients admitted to hospital with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 between January and April 2022. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected within 24 h from admission. RESULTS: There was a significant positive relationship between the number of vaccine doses and the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (r = 0.223, p = 0.012). This association remained significant after adjusting for confounders. Vaccinated patients had significantly higher PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios than the unvaccinated (median: 250; IQR: 195-309 vs. 200; IQR: 156-257, p = 0.013). CONCLUSION: These results highlight the importance of the number of vaccine doses received in reducing the degree of hypoxia on admission in hospitalized COVID-19 patients."	"2076-393x

METHODS: We extracted cumulative COVID-19 mortality data across the EU countries. We evaluated the 27 member states using the location quotient (LQ) to adjust for the expected mortality in the whole EU region, where an LQ <1 signifies a more and an LQ >1 a less favorable outcome. We categorized EU members into 3 distinct profiles based on their LQ estimates: favorable profile, LQ ≤0.9; unfavorable profile, LQ >1.10; and average profile, LQ between 0.9 and 1.10. We compared LQ estimates and profiles with the prevaccination era that ended in December 2020 with the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. RESULTS: Twelve member states had a favorable profile, 4 had an average profile, and 11 had an unfavorable profile. In quantitative analysis, an improvement (negative LQ difference) was noted across countries with higher vaccination coverage (median, 71% fully vaccinated vs 57% for countries with positive LQ differences). There was a significant negative association between the share of fully vaccinated and LQ changes (ρ = -0.62, P < .001) and a significant 4-month lag effect. After COVID-19 vaccines became available, 4 countries improved their profile and 5 moved to a worse profile. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant variability in mortality and impact of COVID-19 between countries, even if they share the same regulatory framework. Extending immunization coverage may lead the transition to a more favorable profile, and alter the trajectory of COVID-19 mortality."	"2328-8957

We aimed to assess the longitudinal association of COVID-19 vaccination with cytokine and chemokine concentrations and trajectories among people with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: In this longitudinal, prospective cohort study, blood samples were used from participants enrolled in a multi-centre randomised trial assessing the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy for ambulatory COVID-19. The trial was conducted in 23 outpatient sites in the USA. In this study, participants (aged ≥18 years) were restricted to those with COVID-19 before vaccination or with breakthrough infections who had blood samples and symptom data collected at screening (pre-transfusion), day 14, and day 90 visits. Associations between COVID-19 vaccination status and concentrations of 21 cytokines and chemokines (measured using multiplexed sandwich immunoassays) were examined using multivariate linear mixed-effects regression models, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, trial group, and COVID-19 waves (pre-alpha or alpha and delta). FINDINGS: Between June 29, 2020, and Sept 30, 2021, 882 participants recently infected with SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled, of whom 506 (57%) were female and 376 (43%) were male. 688 (78%) of 882 participants were unvaccinated, 55 (6%) were partly vaccinated, and 139 (16%) were fully vaccinated at baseline. After adjusting for confounders, geometric mean concentrations of interleukin (IL)-2RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-15, IL-29 (interferon-λ), inducible protein-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and tumour necrosis factor-α were significantly lower among the fully vaccinated group than in the unvaccinated group at screening. On day 90, fully vaccinated participants had approximately 20% lower geometric mean concentrations of IL-7, IL-8, and vascular endothelial growth factor-A than unvaccinated participants. Cytokine and chemokine concentrations decreased over time in the fully and partly vaccinated groups and unvaccinated group. Log(10) cytokine and chemokine concentrations decreased faster among participants in the unvaccinated group than in other groups, but their geometric mean concentrations were generally higher than fully vaccinated participants at 90 days. Days since full vaccination and type of vaccine received were not correlated with cytokine and chemokine concentrations. INTERPRETATION: Initially and during recovery from symptomatic COVID-19, fully vaccinated participants had lower concentrations of inflammatory markers than unvaccinated participants suggesting vaccination is associated with short-term and long-term reduction in inflammation, which could in part explain the reduced disease severity and mortality in vaccinated individuals.

We evaluated the association of intensity and duration of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccines with COVID-19 infection, death, and excess mortality in Europe. METHODS: Data comes from Our Word in Data. We included 22 European countries from January 20, 2020, to May 30, 2021. The time-varying constrained distribution lag model was used in each country to estimate the impact of different intensities and duration of NPIs on COVID-19 control, considering vaccination coverage. Country-specific effects were pooled through meta-analysis. RESULTS: This study found that high-intensity and long-duration of NPIs showed a positive main effect on reducing infection in the absence of vaccines, especially in the intensity above the 80th percentile and lasted for 7 days (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.89-0.98). However, the adverse effect on excess mortality also increased with the duration and intensity. Specifically, it was associated with an increase of 44.16% (RR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.27-1.64) in the excess mortality under the strict intervention (the intensity above the 80th percentile and lasted for 21 days). As the vaccine rollouts, the inhibition of the strict intervention on cases growth rate was increased (RR dropped from 0.95 to 0.87). Simultaneously, vaccination also alleviated the negative impact of the strict intervention on excess mortality (RR decreased from 1.44 to 1.25). Besides, maintaining the strict intervention appeared to more reduce the cases, as well as avoids more overall burden of death compared with weak intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the importance of continued high-intensity NPIs in low vaccine coverage. Lifting of NPIs in insufficient vaccination coverage may cause increased infections and death burden. Policymakers should coordinate the intensity and duration of NPIs and allocate medical resources reasonably with widespread vaccination."	"1876-035x

The present study aims to pool the incidence and outcomes of SVT patients with COVID-19 or having received COVID-19 vaccines. The PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched. Based on the data from cohort studies, meta-analyses were performed to evaluate the incidence of SVT in COVID-19 patients or people having received COVID-19 vaccines. Pooled proportions were calculated. Based on the individual data from case reports, logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with death in SVT patients. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. Among 654 papers initially identified, 135 were included. Based on 12 cohort studies, the pooled incidence of SVT in COVID-19 patients was 0.6%. Data were insufficient to estimate the incidence of SVT after COVID-19 vaccination. Based on 123 case reports, the mortality was 14% (9/64) in SVT patients with COVID-19 and 25% (15/59) in those who received COVID-19 vaccines. Univariate analyses demonstrated that age (OR = 1.061; p = 0.017), diabetes mellitus (OR = 14.00; p = 0.002), anticoagulation (OR = 0.098; p = 0.004), and bowel resection (OR = 16.00; p = 0.001) were significantly associated with death in SVT patients with COVID-19; and anticoagulation (OR = 0.025; p = 0.003) and intravenous immunoglobulin (OR = 0.175; p = 0.046) were significantly associated with death in SVT patients who received COVID-19 vaccines. Multivariate analyses did not identify any independent factor for death in both patients. SVT in COVID-19 patients and in subjects who received COVID-19 vaccines carries a high mortality, but may be improved by anticoagulation. PROSPERO Identifier CRD42022315254."	"1573-742x

The administration of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination is the only reliable strategy to prevent COVID-19 and alleviate the severity of COVID-19 in this particular population. The aim of this article was to evaluate the clinical protection by vaccines (breakthrough infections, deaths, and hospitalizations) in KTRs. There were 135 KTRs with COVID-19 breakthrough infections for whom patient-level data were available in PubMed and Web of Science. There was a male predominance (61.4%), 97 were given the standard vaccination regimen, and 38 received three or four doses of the vaccine. The median age was 59.0 (IQR: 49.0−69.0) years. A total of 67 patients were hospitalized, and 10 patients died. In 72.6% of cases, triple-maintenance immunosuppression was employed. The deceased patients were older than the survivors (p < 0.05); an age over 60 years was a risk factor for death (p < 0.05). The KTRs with booster vaccines had a longer time interval from the last vaccine to COVID-19 infection and lower hospitalization rates than the individuals who received the standard vaccination regimen (33.3% vs. 54.8%, p < 0.05). The hospitalized patients were older than the outpatients (p < 0.05). Among 16,820 fully vaccinated or boosted KTRs from 14 centers, there were 633 breakthrough infections (3.58%) and 73 associated deaths (0.41%). The center-level breakthrough infection rates varied from 0.21% to 9.29%. These findings highlight the need for booster doses for KTRs. However, more research is needed to define the long-term effectiveness and immunogenicity of booster doses and to identify methods to boost the protective response to vaccination in these immunocompromised patients."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical manifestations of dialysis patients with COVID-19 and the protective effect of the vaccine. METHODS: We included 41 studies based on big data, mainly analyzing the clinical symptoms of dialysis patients with COVID-19, the proportion of severe patients before and after vaccination, and the humoral reaction of vaccine in the body. RESULTS: 6.1% to 35.7% of dialysis patients with COVID-19 developed respiratory distress symptoms and needed to be admitted to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation. The incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in dialysis patients before vaccination were 5.5% and 1.1%, respectively, and decreased to 4.5% and 0.6% in breakthrough infected patients. There was no statistical difference in serum conversion rates between dialysis patients and healthy controls, but the neutralizing antibody titer in the control group was 1922 (IQR 533 to 3186) AU/mL, and the neutralizing antibody titer in dialysis patients significantly decreased to 367 (IQR 171 to 1650) AU/mL (P=0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Dialysis is associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19, and generally has a poor seroconversion response to vaccines. It also confirms the protective effect of vaccines on high-risk populations such as dialysis."	"1420-908x

Recipients with COVID-19 were enrolled from December 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023, and followed up until May 31, 2023. Baseline and characteristic data were collected. A total of 930 recipients were included, with a vaccination rate (non-mRNA) of 40.0%. Among 726 (78.1%) recipients with COVID-19, 641 (88.3%) patients were treated at home, 81 (11.2%) patients required hospitalization in general wards, 4 (0.6%) patients required intensive care, and 1 (0.1%) patient died because of COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was related to close contact with confirmed cases (P < .001) and the condition of end-stage kidney disease (P < .046). Older age, male sex, less vaccination, and hypertension were independent risk factors for hospitalization. Fatigue (36.9%) was the most common symptom post-COVID-19, followed by memory loss (35.7%) and sleep disturbance (23.9%). Two doses of vaccines had a protective effect against these post-COVID-19 symptoms (P < .05). During this Omicron outbreak, liver transplant recipients were susceptible to COVID-19, with frequent hospitalization but low mortality. Two doses of non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could protect against liver transplant recipient hospitalization and post-COVID-19 symptoms."	"1600-6143

vaccine safety"	"BACKGROUND: The widespread use of vaccines against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become one of the most effective means to establish a population immune barrier. Patients with cancer are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, adverse events, and high mortality, and should be the focus of epidemic prevention and treatment. However, real-world data on the safety of vaccines for patients with breast cancer are still scarce. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the safety of COVID-19 vaccines between patients vaccinated before or after being diagnosed with breast cancer. METHODS: Patients with breast cancer who sought medical advice from October 2021 to December 2021 were screened. Those who received COVID-19 vaccines were enrolled in this study to analyze the safety of the vaccines. The primary outcome was patient-reported adverse events (AEs). All events after vaccine injection were retrospectively documented from the patients. RESULTS: A total of 15,455 patients with breast cancer from 41 hospitals in 20 provinces in China were screened, and 5766 patients who received COVID-19 vaccines were enrolled. Of those enrolled, 45.1% (n=2599) of patients received vaccines before breast cancer diagnosis, 41.3% (n=2379) were vaccinated after diagnosis, and 13.6% (n=784) did not known the accurate date of vaccination or cancer diagnosis. Among the patients vaccinated after diagnosis, 85.4% (n=2032) were vaccinated 1 year after cancer diagnosis and 95.4% (n=2270) were vaccinated during early-stage cancer. Of all 5766 vaccinated patients, 93.9% (n=5415) received an inactivated vaccine, 3.7% (n=213) received a recombinant subunit vaccine, and 2.4% (n=138) received other vaccines, including adenovirus and mRNA vaccines. In the first injection of vaccines, 24.4% (n=10, 95% CI 11.2-37.5) of patients who received an adenovirus vaccine reported AEs, compared to only 12.5% (n=677, 95% CI 11.6-13.4) of those who received an inactivated vaccine. Patients with metastatic breast cancer reported the highest incidence of AEs (n=18, 16.5%, 95% CI 9.5-23.5). Following the second injection, patients who received an inactivated vaccine (n=464, 8.7%, 95% CI 8.0-9.5) and those who received a recombinant vaccine (n=25, 8.7%, 95% CI 5.5-12.0) reported the same incidence of AEs. No significant differences in patient-reported AEs were found between the healthy population and patients with breast cancer (16.4% vs 16.9%, respectively); the most common AEs were local pain (11.1% vs 9.1%, respectively), fatigue (5.5% vs 6.3%, respectively), and muscle soreness (2.3% vs 3.6%, respectively). The type of vaccine and time window of vaccination had little impact on patient-reported AEs. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients vaccinated before breast cancer diagnosis, there were no significant differences in patient-reported AEs in the patients vaccinated after diagnosis. Thus, it is safe for patients with breast cancer, especially for those in the early stage, to receive COVID-19 vaccines.

Optimal control theory"	"The coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is a novel respiratory disease reported in 2019 in China. The COVID-19 is one of the deadliest pandemics in history due to its high mortality rate in a short period. Many approaches have been adopted for disease minimization and eradication. In this paper, we studied the impact of various constant and time-dependent variable control measures coupled with vaccination on the dynamics of COVID-19. The optimal control theory is used to optimize the model and set an effective control intervention for the infection. Initially, we formulate the mathematical epidemic model for the COVID-19 without variable controls. The model basic mathematical assessment is presented. The nonlinear least-square procedure is utilized to parameterize the model from actual cases reported in Pakistan. A well-known technique based on statistical tools known as the Latin-hypercube sampling approach (LHS) coupled with the partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) is applied to present the model global sensitivity analysis. Based on global sensitivity analysis, the COVID-19 vaccine model is reformulated to obtain a control problem by introducing three time dependent control variables for isolation, vaccine efficacy and treatment enhancement represented by u1(t) , u2(t) and u3(t) , respectively. The necessary optimality conditions of the control problem are derived via the optimal control theory. Finally, the simulation results are depicted with and without variable controls using the well-known Runge-Kutta numerical scheme. The simulation results revealed that time-dependent control measures play a vital role in disease eradication."	"2211-3797

Systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) databases without language restriction for studies published before September 19, 2022. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022335430) and reported according to PRISMA guidelines. Forty studies met the inclusion criteria for this study, with 62 954 861 participants. The overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) to prevent COVID-19 infection was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73-0.78), symptomatic infection was 0.87 (95% CI 0.83-0.91), hospital admissions was 0.82 (95% CI 0.75-0.87), and mortality was 0.76 (95% CI 0.48-0.89). Subgroup analysis were performed to characterize the effectiveness of different vaccines. When SARS-CoV-2 variants are taking account, the VE decreased along with the variation of the virus by clinical outcomes and vaccine types. The findings of this systematic review provide the best available evidence that BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1, and Ad26. COV2.S seems to be approximately effective from predelta to omicron, but only modestly effective in participants aged 65 or older. When SARS-CoV-2 variants are taking account, VE decreased along with the variation of the virus for all mRNA and viral-vector vaccines."	"1096-9071

In this meta-analysis study, the effect of influenza vaccination on the prevention of COVID-19 and its consequences in patients were investigated. The systematic search for this study was performed from November 2019 to 25 November 2020, in the databases of Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Ebsco, Cochrane and medRxiv. Search terms used included COVID-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, covid, influenza, flu, grippe and vaccine. The present study examined the association between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 including COVID-19 infection, mortality, hospitalisation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Finally, the pooled estimates for different outcomes were calculated by the software for statistics and data science (STATA) version 15 and I(2) was used to determine the heterogeneity. By analysing the data of articles, the pooled estimates of these data indicated that influenza vaccination could lower probability of COVID-19 infection up to 24% (OR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.91), of death up to 32% (OR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.42, 1.11), of the hospitalisation up to 25% (OR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.46; 1.23) and of admission to ICU up to 29% (OR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.40, 1.27). Influenza vaccination can help decrease the COVID-19 infection and reduce hospitalisation and the need for ICU and mortality rates."	"2180-4303

SARS-CoV-2"	"BACKGROUNDS: SARS-CoV-2 is affecting different countries all over the world, with significant variation in infection-rate and death-ratio. We have previously shown a presence of a possible relationship between different variables including the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, average age, gender, and malaria treatment, and the rate of spread, severity and mortality of COVID-19 disease. This paper focuses on developing machine learning models for this relationship. METHODS: We have used real-datasets collected from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to develop a model from China data as the baseline country. From this model, we predicted and forecasted different countries' daily confirmed-cases and daily death-cases and examined if there was any possible effect of the variables mentioned above. RESULTS: The model was trained based on China data as a baseline model for daily confirmed-cases and daily death-cases. This machine learning application succeeded in modelling and forecasting daily confirmed-cases and daily death-cases. The modelling and forecasting of viral spread resulted in four different regions; these regions were dependent on the malarial treatments, BCG vaccination, weather conditions, and average age. However, the lack of social distancing resulted in variation in the effect of these factors, for example, double-humped spread and mortality cases curves and sudden increases in the spread and mortality cases in different countries. The process of machine learning for time-series prediction and forecasting, especially in the pandemic COVID-19 domain, proved usefulness in modelling and forecasting the end status of the virus spreading based on specific regional and health support variables. CONCLUSION: From the experimental results, we confirm that COVID-19 has a very low spread in the African countries with all the four variables (average young age, hot weather, BCG vaccine and malaria treatment); a very high spread in European countries and the USA with no variable (old people, cold weather, no BCG vaccine and no malaria). The effect of the variables could be on the spread or the severity to the extent that the infected subject might not have symptoms or the case is mild and can be missed as a confirmed-case. Social distancing decreases the effect of these factors."	"1742-1241

The elderly also suffer from increased morbidity and mortality from seasonal influenza infection, and thus annual influenza vaccination is recommended for them. In this study, we explore a possible area-level association between influenza vaccination coverage in people aged 65 years and older and the number of deaths from COVID-19. To this end, we used COVID-19 data until June 10, 2020 together with population health data for the United States at the county level. We fit quasi-Poisson regression models using influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly population as the independent variable and the number of deaths from COVID-19 as the outcome variable. We adjusted for a wide array of potential confounding variables using both county-level generalized propensity scores for influenza vaccination rates, as well as direct adjustment. Our results suggest that influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly population is negatively associated with mortality from COVID-19. This finding is robust to using different analysis periods, different thresholds for inclusion of counties, and a variety of methodologies for confounding adjustment. In conclusion, our results suggest a potential protective effect of the influenza vaccine on COVID-19 mortality in the elderly population. The significant public health implications of this possibility point to an urgent need for studying the relationship between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 mortality at the individual level, to investigate both the epidemiology and any underlying biological mechanism."

AIM: To find the association between COVID-19 vaccines and myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS: This is a systematic review that involved searching databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PakMediNet after making a search strategy using MeSH and Emtree terms. Eligibility criteria were set, and studies having no mention of MI as a complication of COVID-19 vaccination, protocols, genetic studies, and animal studies were excluded. Data was extracted using a predesigned extraction table, and 29 studies were selected after screening and applying the eligibility criteria. RESULTS: The majority of studies mentioned AstraZeneca (18 studies) followed by Pfizer (14 studies) and Moderna (9 studies) in subjects reporting MI after vaccination. Out of all the studies, 69% reported MI cases after the first COVID-19 vaccination dose and 14% after the second, 44% reported ST-segment elevation MI, and 26% reported non-ST-segment elevation MI. The mortality rate was 29% after MI. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, many studies linked MI to COVID-19 vaccinations, but no definitive association could be found."	"2307-8960

Understanding the long-term effectiveness of these vaccines is imperative to developing recommendations for precautions and booster doses. Comparisons between more and less vaccinated groups may be misleading due to selection bias, as these groups may differ in underlying health status and thus risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. We study all adult deaths over April 1, 2021-June 30, 2022 in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, linked to vaccination records, use mortality from other natural causes to proxy for underlying health, and report relative COVID-19 mortality risk (RMR) for vaccinees versus the unvaccinated, using a novel outcome measure that controls for selection effects. This measure, COVID Excess Mortality Percentage (CEMP) uses the non-COVID natural mortality rate (Non-Covid-NMR) as a measure of population risk of COVID mortality without vaccination. We validate this measure during the pre-vaccine period (r = 0.97) and demonstrate that selection effects are large, with Non-Covid-NMRs for two-dose vaccinees less than half those for the unvaccinated, and Non-COVID NMRs still lower for three dose (booster) recipients. Progressive waning of two-dose effectiveness is observed, with relative mortality risk (RMR) for two-dose vaccinees aged 60 + versus the unvaccinated of 11% during April-June 2021, rising steadily to 36% during the Omicron period (January-June, 2022). Notably, a booster dose reduced RMR to 10-11% for ages 60+. Boosters thus provide important additional protection against mortality."	"Yuan, Andy

In this retrospective cohort study with exact matching and propensity score adjustment within the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system, we selected immunocompromised veterans age ≥18 years as of 1 January 2022, receiving VA healthcare. We compared a cohort of 1,878 patients treated with at least one dose of intramuscular tixagevimab/cilgavimab to 7,014 matched controls selected from patients who met study criteria but were not treated. Patients were followed through 15 June 2022, or until death, whichever occurred earlier. The primary outcome was a composite of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI for the association between receipt of tixagevimab/cilgavimab and outcomes. Most (73%) tixagevimab/cilgavimab recipients were ≥65 years old, and 80% had ≥3 mRNA vaccine doses or two doses of Ad26.COV2. Compared to matched controls, recipients had a lower incidence of the composite COVID-19 outcome (49/1,878 [2.6%] versus 312/7,014 [4.4%]; HR 0.35; 95% CI, 0.24-0.52), and individually SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22-0.88), COVID-19 hospitalization (HR 0.24; 95% CI, 0.10-0.59), and all-cause mortality (HR 0.32; 95% CI, 0.19-0.55). In conclusion, tixagevimab/cilgavimab was associated with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 during the Omicron BA.1, BA.2, and BA.2.12.1 surge. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 remains an ongoing global health crisis that justifies continued efforts to validate and expand, when possible, knowledge on the efficacy of available vaccines and treatments. Clinical trials have been limited due to fast tracking of medications for mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic for the general population. We present a real-world analysis, using electronic health record data, of the effectiveness of tixagevimab/cilgavimab for the prevention of COVID-19 infection in the unique population of U.S. veterans. Unlike those in the PROVENT clinical trial from which the emergency use authorization for tixagevimab/cilgavimab as a preventative treatment arose, the veterans population is highly immunocompromised and nearly 96% totally vaccinated. These demographics allowed us to analyze the effectiveness of tixagevimab/cilgavimab in preventing COVID-19 under different conditions in a more fragile population than that of the initial clinical trial."

Methods and Results In a retrospective cohort study of all patients diagnosed with NSTEMI in the US Veterans Affairs Healthcare System from January 1, 2019 to October 30, 2022 (n=67 125), procedural treatments and outcomes were compared between the prepandemic period and 6 unique pandemic phases: (1) acute phase, (2) community spread, (3) first peak, (4) post vaccine, (5) second peak, and (6) recovery. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to assess the association between pandemic phases and 30-day mortality. NSTEMI volumes dropped significantly with the pandemic onset (62.7% of prepandemic peak) and did not revert to prepandemic levels in subsequent phases, even after vaccine availability. Percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting volumes declined proportionally. Compared with the prepandemic period, patients with NSTEMI experienced higher 30-day mortality during Phases 2 and 3, even after adjustment for COVID-19-positive status, demographics, baseline comorbidities, and receipt of procedural treatment (adjusted odds ratio for Phases 2 and 3 combined, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.13-1.43], P<0.01). Patients receiving Veterans Affairs-paid community care had a higher adjusted risk of 30-day mortality compared with those at Veterans Affairs hospitals across all 6 pandemic phases. Conclusions Higher mortality after NSTEMI occurred during the initial spread and first peak of the pandemic but resolved before the second, higher peak-suggesting effective adaptation of care delivery but a costly delay to implementation. Investigation into the vulnerabilities of the early pandemic spread are vital to informing future resource-constrained practices."	"2047-9980

Yet, data on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccinations among this vulnerable population are limited. A case-control study was conducted to investigate the risks of COVID-19-related hospitalisation and mortality among individuals with mental disorders following one to three doses of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccinations in Hong Kong. Data were extracted from electronic health records, vaccination and COVID-19 confirmed case records. Conditional logistic regression was applied with adjustment for comorbidities and medication history. Subgroup analyses were performed with stratification: by age (< 65 and ≥ 65) and mental disorders diagnosis (depression, schizophrenia, anxiety disorder, and bipolar disorder). Two doses of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac significantly reduced COVID-19-related hospitalisation and mortality. Further protection for both outcomes was provided after three doses of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac. The vaccine effectiveness magnitude of BNT162b2 was generally higher than CoronaVac, but the difference diminished after the third dose. Individuals with mental disorders should be prioritised in future mass vaccination programmes of booster doses or bivalent COVID-19 vaccines. Targeted strategies should be developed to resolve the reasons behind vaccine hesitancy among this population and increase their awareness on the benefits of vaccination."	"1872-7123

Streptococcus pneumonia bacteria, influenza-causing viruses, and COVID-19 viruses cause three pathologies in the respiratory system with similar symptoms, transmission routes, and risk factors. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of pneumococcal, influenza, and COVID-19 vaccinations on the status of COVID-19 hospitalization and progression in people over 65 years of age living in nursing homes. This study was performed in all nursing homes and elderly care centers in the Uskudar district of Istanbul.The diagnosis rate of COVID-19 was determined as 49%, the rate of hospitalization as 22.4%, the rate of hospitalization in the intensive care unit as 12.2%. The rate of intubation was determined as 10.4%, the rate of mechanical ventilation as 11.1% and the rate of COVID-19 related mortality rate as 9.7%. When the factors affecting the diagnosis of COVID-19 were examined, the presence and dose of COVID-19 vaccine was protective. When the factors affecting hospitalization status were examined, male sex and presence of chronic disease were risk factors; four doses of COVID-19 vaccine and influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine together with COVID-19 vaccine were protective. When the factors affecting COVID-19-related death were examined, the male sex was a risk factor; the pneumococcal and influenza vaccine together with COVID-19 vaccine were protective. Our results revealed that the availability of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines positively impacted the progression of COVID-19 disease in the elderly population living in nursing homes."

METHODS: Children and adolescents 12 years of age and older who presented with discomfort after BNT162b2 immunization (BNTI) and visited pediatric emergency room (PER) at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from September 22, 2021 to March 21, 2022, were included for analysis. RESULTS: 681 children presented with discomfort after BNTI and visited our PER. The mean age was 15.1 ± 1.7 years. Three hundred and ninety-four (57.9%) and 287 (42.1%) events were after 1st and 2nd dose, respectively. 58.4% (n = 398) were male. The most common complaints were chest pain (46.7%) and chest tightness (27.0%). The median (interquartile range [IQR]) interval of discomfort after BNTI was 3.0 (1.0-12.0) days. BNTI-related pericarditis, myocarditis and myopericarditis were diagnosed in 15 (2.2%), 12 (1.8%) and 2 (0.3%) patients, respectively. Eleven (1.6%) needed hospitalization in PICU. The median (IQR) hospital stay was 4.0 (3.0-6.0) days. There was no mortality. More patients were diagnosed myocarditis (p = 0.004) after 2nd dose BNTI. PICU admission occurred more commonly after 2nd dose BNTI (p = 0.007). Risk factors associated with hospitalization in PICU were abnormal EKG findings (p = 0.047) and abnormal serum troponin levels (p = 0.003) at PER. CONCLUSION: Myocarditis in children aged 12-18 years occurred more commonly following 2nd dose BNTI. Most cases were of mild or intermediate severity without death. Factors predicting BNTI-related myocarditis and consequent hospitalization in PICU were abnormal EKG findings and abnormal serum troponin levels at PER in this study."	"2212-1692

We have conducted a retrospective observational study to assess the clinical characteristics, immunological response, and disease outcomes among the vaccinated and unvaccinated patients admitted to the ICU with severe COVID-19 disease. METHODS: Study Design and Participants. We conducted a retrospective observational study in COVID ICU of a tertiary care hospital. Data were collected from the month of 1 April 2021 to 31 November 2021. All adult patients admitted to the ICU having severe COVID-19 disease were included in the study. Data were collected from the medical records database which included demographics, a clinical course in the ICU, laboratory and radiological parameters, and disease outcomes. In a subset of patients, cell-mediated immunity and S1S2-neutralising antibody assessment was done. RESULTS: A total of 419 patients with severe COVID-19 were included in the study. Of the 419 patients, 90 (21.5%) were vaccinated, and 329 (78.5%) were unvaccinated. There was a significantly higher mortality in unvaccinated severe COVID 19 patients as compared to vaccinated severe COVID patients (46.2% vs 34.4%; P < 0.0455). The neutralizing antibody titre was significantly higher in survivors as compared to nonsurvivors (2139.8, SE ± 713.3 vs 471, SE ± 154.4); P < 0.026. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests the association of lower neutralizing antibody levels with mortality in ICU patients admitted with COVID-19 breakthrough infections."	"2090-1313

An increasing amount of evidence suggests that annual influenza vaccination reduces CVD-related morbidity and mortality. Despite various clinical guidelines recommending annual influenza vaccination for the general population for influenza-like illness risk reduction, with a particular emphasis on people with CVD, vaccination rates fall consistently below the goal established by the World Health Organization. This review outlines the importance of influenza vaccination, mechanisms of cardiovascular events in influenza, summarizing the available literature on the effects of influenza vaccine in CVD and the benefits of influenza vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic."

The association between vaccination and risk of cardiovascular complications shortly after SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with cardiovascular disease remains unknown. Methods and Results A case-control study was conducted with cases defined as patients who had myocardial infarction or stroke within 28 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 1, 2022 and August 15, 2022. Controls were defined as all other patients who attended any health services and were not cases. Individuals without history of cardiovascular disease were excluded. Each case was randomly matched with 10 controls according to sex, age, Charlson comorbidity index, and date of hospital admission. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI was estimated using conditional logistic regression. We identified 808 cases matched with 7771 controls among all patients with cardiovascular disease. Results showed that vaccination with BNT162b2 or CoronaVac was associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction or stroke after SARS-CoV-2 infection with a dose-response relationship. For BNT162b2, risk decreased from 0.49 (95% CI, 0.29-0.84) to 0.30 (95% CI, 0.20-0.44) and 0.17 (95% CI, 0.08-0.34) from 1 to 3 doses, respectively. Similar trends were observed for CoronaVac, with risk decreased from 0.69 (95% CI, 0.57-0.85) to 0.42 (95% CI, 0.34-0.52) and 0.32 (95% CI, 0.21-0.49) from 1 to 3 doses, respectively. Conclusions Vaccination with BNT162b2 or CoronaVac is associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction or stroke after SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with cardiovascular disease."

We investigated whether the clinical and microbiological features and outcomes were different between hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were either fully vaccinated with Coronovac or not. All hospitalized COVID-19 patients who had at least one dose of Coronavac were included in the study. The oldest unvaccinated patients with comorbidities, who were hospitalized during the same period, were chosen as controls. All epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory data of the patients were recorded and compared between the fully vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. There were 69 and 217 patients who had been either fully vaccinated with Coronavac or not, respectively. All breakthrough infections occurred in the first 3 months of vaccination. Fully vaccinated patients were older and had more comorbidities than unvaccinated patients. There were minor differences between the groups in symptoms, physical and laboratory findings, anti-spike IgG positivity rate and level, the severity of COVID-19, complications, and clinical improvement rate. The mortality rate of fully vaccinated patients was higher than the mortality rate in unvaccinated patients in univariate analysis, which was attributed to the fact that vaccinated patients were older and had more comorbidities. The severity and clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients with breakthrough COVID-19 after Coronavac vaccination were similar to those of unvaccinated patients. Our findings suggest that the immune response elicited by Coronovac could be insufficient to prevent COVID-19-related severe disease and death within 3 months of vaccination among elderly people with comorbidities."

Pooled evidence from a larger, international cohort is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features and early outcomes associated with myopericarditis after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in a heterogeneous population of adolescents and young adults. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and EMBASE were searched through August 2022. Language restrictions were not applied. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies and case series describing COVID-19 vaccine-associated myopericarditis in adolescents and young adults aged 12 to 20 years and reporting clinical characteristics and early outcomes were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent investigators extracted relevant data from each study. One-group meta-analysis in a random effects model was performed. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines were followed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were clinical features and early outcomes for COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-associated myopericarditis, including incident rate, cardiac findings, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 23 observational studies were identified, including 854 individuals (mean age, 15.9 [95% CI, 15.5-16.2] years) with COVID-19 vaccine-associated myopericarditis. Male sex was predominant, at 90.3% (95% CI, 87.3%-93.2%) of individuals. The incident rate was higher after the second dose than the first dose, with 74.4% (95% CI, 58.2%-90.5%) of events occurring after the second dose. Most patients (84.4% [95% CI, 80.5%-88.3%] of patients) had preserved left ventricular (LV) function. Of the 15.6% (95% CI, 11.7%-19.5%) of patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction [LVEF] <55%), most (14.1% [95% CI, 10.2%-18.1%]) were mild (ie, LVEF 45%-54%), and only 1.3% (95% CI, 0%-2.6%) of patients had severe LV systolic dysfunction (ie, LVEF<35%). Interestingly, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed late gadolinium enhancement in 87.2% (95% CI, 79.8%-94.7%) of patients. Although 92.6% (95% CI, 87.8%-97.3%) of patients were hospitalized and 23.2% (95% CI, 11.7%-34.7%) of patients required ICU admission, inotropes were used in only 1.3% (95% CI, 0%-2.7%) of patients, no patients died or required mechanical support, and the hospital length of stay was 2.8 (95% CI, 2.1-3.5) days. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis found low incidence rate and largely favorable early outcomes of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-associated myopericarditis in adolescents and young adults from a wide range of populations. These findings are reassuring but continued follow-up is warranted."	"2168-6211

This study provides an in-depth account of various cardiovascular adverse events reported after the mRNA vaccines' first or second dose including pericarditis/myopericarditis, myocarditis, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, stroke, myocardial infarction/STEMI, intracranial hemorrhage, thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis, cerebral venous thrombosis, arterial or venous thrombotic events, portal vein thrombosis, coronary thrombosis, microvascular small bowel thrombosis), and pulmonary embolism. METHODS: A systematic review of original studies reporting confirmed cardiovascular manifestations post-mRNA COVID-19 vaccination was performed. Following the PRISMA guidelines, electronic databases (PubMed, PMC NCBI, and Cochrane Library) were searched until January 2022. Baseline characteristics of patients and disease outcomes were extracted from relevant studies. RESULTS: A total of 81 articles analyzed confirmed cardiovascular complications post-COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in 17,636 individuals and reported 284 deaths with any mRNA vaccine. Of 17,636 cardiovascular events with any mRNA vaccine, 17,192 were observed with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine, 444 events with mRNA-1273 (Moderna). Thrombosis was frequently reported with any mRNA vaccine (n = 13,936), followed by stroke (n = 758), myocarditis (n = 511), myocardial infarction (n = 377), pulmonary embolism (n = 301), and arrhythmia (n = 254). Stratifying the results by vaccine type showed that thrombosis (80.8%) was common in the BNT162b2 cohort, while stroke (39.9%) was common with mRNA-1273 for any dose. The time between the vaccination dosage and the first symptom onset averaged 5.6 and 4.8 days with the mRNA-1273 vaccine and BNT162b2, respectively. The mRNA-1273 cohort reported 56 deaths compared to the 228 with BNT162b2, while the rest were discharged or transferred to the ICU. CONCLUSION: Available literature includes more studies with the BNT162b2 vaccine than mRNA-1273. Future studies must report mortality and adverse cardiovascular events by vaccine types."	"2050-4527

The vaccines available at present were designed to prevent infection from COVID-19 strains and control viral spread. Although the incidence of pregnancy cycle outcomes are not likely to increase patients vaccinated prior to pregnancy compared with unvaccinated patients based on our knowledge of vaccination safety, there is no specific evidence to support this hypothesis. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the association between maternal vaccination prior to conception and pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 2,614 women who received prenatal care and delivered in the Obstetrical Department of The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University between February 2022 and November 2022. Of the 1,380 eligible pregnant women, 899 women who had received preconception vaccination were assigned to a vaccine group and 481 women who were not vaccinated were control group. Of the enrolled patients, 291 women received fertility treatment (141 vaccinated women, 150 unvaccinated women). The primary outcomes were pregnancy complications (hypothyroidism, gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy-induced hypertension, polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios, premature rupture of membranes and postpartum hemorrhage), obstetric outcomes (preterm birth rate, cesarean section rate) and neonatal outcomes (birth-weight, body length, low-birth-weight rate, rate of congenital defects, neonatal mortality and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications during pregnancy and delivery when compared between the vaccine group and control group in either univariate- or multivariate-models. The type of vaccine was not associated with the odds of adverse pregnancy outcome. Among the women with infertility treatment, the vaccinated group and the unvaccinated group had similar pregnancy outcomes. CONCLUSION: Women who received COVID-19 vaccination prior to conception had similar maternal and neonatal outcomes as women who were unvaccinated. Our findings indicate that COVID-19 vaccinations can be safely administered prior to pregnancy in women who are planning pregnancy or assisted reproductive treatment. During new waves of COVID-19 infection, women who are planning pregnancy should be vaccinated as soon as possible to avoid subsequent infections."	"2296-858x

METHODS: We carried out a systemic review and meta-analysis where MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials were queried to identify relevant literature. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized trials, prospective, observational cohort, and case-control studies assessing breakthrough infection, hospital admission, and mortality after coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination in the elderly (≥ 60 years old). RESULTS: Overall, 26 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with the unvaccinated group, the vaccinated group showed a decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection after 28-34 (relative risk [RR] = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.49) and 35-60 days (RR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.37-0.62). There was a step-wise increase in efficacy with additional doses with the two-dose group experiencing decreased risk of breakthrough infection (RR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.32-0.42), hospital admissions (RR = 0.25, 95% CI 0.14-0.45), disease severity (RR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.20-0.70), and mortality (RR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.14-0.32) compared with those receiving one or no doses. Similarly three-dose and four-dose vaccine groups also showed a decreased risk of breakthrough infection (3-dose: RR = 0.14, 95% CI 0.10-0.20; 4-dose RR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.4-0.53), hospital admissions (3-dose: RR = 0.11, 95% CI 0.07-0.17; 4-dose: RR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.32-0.55), and all-cause mortality (3-dose: RR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.48; 4-dose: RR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.28-0.84) Subgroup analysis found that protection against mortality for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated groups was similar by age (60-79 years: RR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.74; ≥ 80 years: RR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59-0.98) and gender (female: RR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50-0.87, male: (RR = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44-0.76), and comorbid cardiovascular disease (CVD) (RR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52-0.92) or diabetes (DM) (RR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39-0.89. CONCLUSIONS: Our pooled results showed that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines administered to the elderly is effective in preventing prevent breakthrough infection, hospitalization, severity, and death. What's more, increasing number of vaccine doses is becoming increasingly effective."	"1525-1497

METHODS: Extracted from the statewide electronic health record data, we analyzed the clinical outcome of 34,502 HCWs and 1,071,020 non-HCWs adults diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 between March 2, 2020 to April 14, 2022. Logistic regression models were used to explore the association between different pandemic phases and COVID-19 severity-related outcomes. RESULTS: Substantial reductions in mortality were observed following the vaccine rollout in non-HCWs and HCWs. Compared to the pre-vaccination period, non-HCWs patients diagnosed during post-vaccination with Alpha predominance (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.10; 95%CI: 1.04-1.16) were more likely to be hospitalized, but the reduced mortality rates were observed in all post-vaccination periods. Regarding HCWs, a reduced mortality rate was only observed in the pre-Alpha (aOR: 0.33; 95%CI: 0.13-0.84) and Omicron periods (aOR: 0.21; 95%CI: 0.05-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: The declining protection effect of vaccines informs the importance of early promotion of the booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for HCWs who have more occupational exposure."

During 2020-2022, COVID-19 was one of the leading causes of death in the United States and by far the leading cause among infectious diseases. Vaccination uptake remains low despite this being an effective burden reducing intervention. The development of COVID-19 therapeutics provides hope for mitigating severe clinical outcomes. This modeling study examines combined strategies of vaccination and treatment to reduce the burden of COVID-19 epidemics over the next decade. METHODS: We use a validated mathematical model to evaluate the reduction of incident cases, hospitalized cases, and deaths in the United States through 2033 under various levels of vaccination and treatment coverage. We assume that future seasonal transmission patterns for COVID-19 will be similar to those of influenza virus and account for the waning of infection-induced immunity and vaccine-induced immunity in a future with stable COVID-19 dynamics. Due to uncertainty in the duration of immunity following vaccination or infection, we consider three exponentially distributed waning rates, with means of 365 days (1 year), 548 days (1.5 years), and 730 days (2 years). We also consider treatment failure, including rebound frequency, as a possible treatment outcome. RESULTS: As expected, universal vaccination is projected to eliminate transmission and mortality. Under current treatment coverage (13.7%) and vaccination coverage (49%), averages of 81,000-164,600 annual reported deaths, depending on duration of immunity, are expected by the end of this decade. Annual mortality in the United States can be reduced below 50,000 per year with 52-80% annual vaccination coverage and below 10,000 annual deaths with 59-83% annual vaccination coverage, depending on duration of immunity. Universal treatment reduces hospitalizations by 88.6% and deaths by 93.1% under current vaccination coverage. A reduction in vaccination coverage requires a comparatively larger increase in treatment coverage in order for hospitalization and mortality levels to remain unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Adopting universal vaccination and universal treatment goals in the United States will likely lead to a COVID-19 mortality burden below 50,000 deaths per year, a burden comparable to that of influenza virus."

SARS-CoV-2"	"BACKGROUND: Hong Kong contained COVID-19 for two years but experienced a large epidemic of Omicron BA.2 in early 2022 and endemic transmission of Omicron subvariants thereafter. We reflected on pandemic preparedness and responses by assessing COVID-19 transmission and associated disease burden in the context of implementation of various public health and social measures (PHSMs). METHODS: We examined the use and impact of pandemic controls in Hong Kong by analysing data on more than 1.7 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and characterizing the temporal changes non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions implemented from January 2020 through to 30 December 2022. We estimated the daily effective reproductive number (R(t)) to track changes in transmissibility and effectiveness of community-based measures against infection over time. We examined the temporal changes of pharmaceutical interventions, mortality rate and case-fatality risks (CFRs), particularly among older adults. FINDINGS: Hong Kong experienced four local epidemic waves predominated by the ancestral strain in 2020 and early 2021 and prevented multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants from spreading in the community before 2022. Strict travel-related, case-based, and community-based measures were increasingly tightened in Hong Kong over the first two years of the pandemic. However, even very stringent measures were unable to contain the spread of Omicron BA.2 in Hong Kong. Despite high overall vaccination uptake (>70% with at least two doses), high mortality was observed during the Omicron BA.2 wave due to lower vaccine coverage (42%) among adults ≥65 years of age. Increases in antiviral usage and vaccination uptake over time through 2022 was associated with decreased case fatality risks. INTERPRETATION: Integrated strict measures were able to reduce importation risks and interrupt local transmission to contain COVID-19 transmission and disease burden while awaiting vaccine development and rollout. Increasing coverage of pharmaceutical interventions among high-risk groups reduced infection-related mortality and mitigated the adverse health impact of the pandemic.

Vaccine effectiveness"	"Data regarding protection against mortality and severe complications after Omicron BA.2 infection with CoronaVac and BNT162b2 vaccines remains limited. We conducted a case-control study to evaluate the risk of severe complications and mortality following 1-3 doses of CoronaVac and BNT162b2 using electronic health records database. Cases were adults with their first COVID-19-related mortality or severe complications between 1 January and 31 March 2022, matched with up-to 10 controls by age, sex, index date, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related mortality and severe complications by type and number of doses was estimated using conditional logistic regression adjusted for comorbidities and medications. Vaccine effectiveness (95% CI) against COVID-19-related mortality after two doses of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac were 90.7% (88.6-92.3) and 74.8% (72.5-76.9) in those aged ≥65, 87.6% (81.4-91.8) and 80.7% (72.8-86.3) in those aged 50-64, 86.6% (71.0-93.8) and 82.7% (56.5-93.1) in those aged 18-50. Vaccine effectiveness against severe complications after two doses of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac were 82.1% (74.6-87.3) and 58.9% (50.3-66.1) in those aged ≥65, 83.0% (69.6-90.5) and 67.1% (47.1-79.6) in those aged 50-64, 78.3% (60.8-88.0) and 77.8% (49.6-90.2) in those aged 18-50. Further risk reduction with the third dose was observed especially in those aged ≥65 years, with vaccine effectiveness of 98.0% (96.5-98.9) for BNT162b2 and 95.5% (93.7-96.8) for CoronaVac against mortality, 90.8% (83.4-94.9) and 88.0% (80.8-92.5) against severe complications. Both CoronaVac and BNT162b2 vaccination were effective against COVID-19-related mortality and severe complications amidst the Omicron BA.2 pandemic, and risks decreased further with the third dose."

waning vaccine effectiveness"	"BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate waning effectiveness against severe and fatal COVID-19 with two to three doses of CoronaVac/BNT162b2, where data are limited. METHODS: A case-control study included individuals aged ≥18 years, unvaccinated or received two to three doses of CoronaVac/BNT162b2, using electronic healthcare databases in Hong Kong. Those with first COVID-19-related hospitalization, severe complications, or mortality between 1 January and 15 August 2022 were defined as cases and matched with up-to-10 controls by age, sex, index date, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19-related outcomes was estimated at different time intervals from second and third-dose vaccination (0-13 up-to 210-240 days) using conditional logistic regression adjusted for comorbidities and medications. RESULTS: By 211-240 days after second dose, VE against COVID-19-related hospitalization reduced to 46.6% (40.7-51.8%) for BNT162b2 and 36.2% (28.0-43.4%) for CoronaVac, and VE against COVID-19-related mortality were 73.8% (55.9-84.4%) and 76.6% (60.8-86.0%). After third dose, VE against COVID-19-related hospitalization decreased from 91.2% (89.5-92.6%) for BNT162b2 and 76.7% (73.7-79.4%) for CoronaVac at 0-13 days, to 67.1% (60.4-72.6%) and 51.3% (44.2-57.5%) at 91-120 days. VE against COVID-19-related mortality for BNT162b2 remained high from 0-13 days [98.2% (95.0-99.3%)] to 91-120 days [94.6% (77.7-98.7%)], and for CoronaVac reduced from 0-13 days [96.7% (93.2-98.4%)] to 91-120 days [86.4% (73.3-93.1%)]. CONCLUSIONS: Significant risk reduction against COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality after CoronaVac or BNT162b2 vaccination was observed for >240 and >120 days after second and third doses compared to unvaccinated, despite significant waning over time. Timely administration of booster doses could provide higher levels of protection."	"2222-1751

We conducted a large cohort study to evaluate the risk of non-COVID-19 mortality after COVID-19 vaccination while adjusting for confounders including individual-level demographics, clinical risk factors, health care utilization, and community-level socioeconomic risk factors. METHODS: The retrospective cohort study consisted of members from seven Vaccine Safety Datalink sites from December 14, 2020 through August 31, 2021. We conducted three separate analyses for each of the three COVID-19 vaccines used in the US. Crude non-COVID-19 mortality rates were reported by vaccine type, age, sex, and race/ethnicity. The counting process model for survival analyses was used to analyze non-COVID-19 mortality where a new observation period began when the vaccination status changed upon receipt of the first dose and the second dose. We used calendar time as the basic time scale in survival analyses to implicitly adjust for season and other temporal trend factors. A propensity score approach was used to adjust for the potential imbalance in confounders between the vaccinated and comparison groups. RESULTS: For each vaccine type and across age, sex, and race/ethnicity groups, crude non-COVID-19 mortality rates among COVID-19 vaccinees were lower than those among comparators. After adjusting for confounders with the propensity score approach, the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were 0.46 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.49) after dose 1 and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.46-0.50) after dose 2 of the BNT162b2 vaccine, 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.44) after dose 1 and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.37-0.40) after dose 2 of the mRNA-1273 vaccine, and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.51-0.59) after receipt of Ad26.COV2.S. CONCLUSION: While residual confounding bias remained after adjusting for several individual-level and community-level risk factors, no increased risk was found for non-COVID-19 mortality among recipients of three COVID-19 vaccines used in the US."

However, daily vaccination rates have declined approximately 78% since April 13, 2021(†); vaccine safety concerns have contributed to vaccine hesitancy (4). A cohort study of 19,625 nursing home residents found that those who received an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) had lower all-cause mortality than did unvaccinated residents (5), but no studies comparing mortality rates within the general population of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons have been conducted. To assess mortality not associated with COVID-19 (non-COVID-19 mortality) after COVID-19 vaccination in a general population setting, a cohort study was conducted during December 2020-July 2021 among approximately 11 million persons enrolled in seven Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) sites.(§) After standardizing mortality rates by age and sex, this study found that COVID-19 vaccine recipients had lower non-COVID-19 mortality than did unvaccinated persons. After adjusting for demographic characteristics and VSD site, this study found that adjusted relative risk (aRR) of non-COVID-19 mortality for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 0.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38-0.44) after dose 1 and 0.34 (95% CI = 0.33-0.36) after dose 2. The aRRs of non-COVID-19 mortality for the Moderna vaccine were 0.34 (95% CI = 0.32-0.37) after dose 1 and 0.31 (95% CI = 0.30-0.33) after dose 2. The aRR after receipt of the Janssen vaccine was 0.54 (95% CI = 0.49-0.59). There is no increased risk for mortality among COVID-19 vaccine recipients. This finding reinforces the safety profile of currently approved COVID-19 vaccines in the United States."	"1545-861x

safety"	"In the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, vaccinations were essential in preventing COVID-19 infections and related mortality in older adults. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines in older adults. We systematically searched the electronic bibliographic databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, Research Square, and OpenGrey, as well as other sources of gray literature, for studies published between January 1, 2020, and October 1, 2022. We retrieved 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with a total of 3,404,696 older adults (aged over 60 years) participating, that were included in the meta-analysis. No significant publication bias was found. In the cumulative meta-analysis, we found that the COVID-19 vaccines were effective in preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.23-0.65, p = 0.0004) and in reducing the number of COVID-19-related deaths (OR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.10-0.25, p < 0.00001) in elderly people. Antibody seroconversion (AS) and geometric mean titer (GMT) levels significantly increased in vaccinated older adults [OR = 24.42, 95% CI = 19.29-30.92; standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.64-1.20, respectively]. However, local and systemic adverse events after COVID-19 vaccine administration were found in older adults (OR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.83-3.62, p < 0.00001). Although vaccination might induce certain adverse reactions in the elderly population, the available evidence showed that the COVID-19 vaccines are effective and tolerated, as shown by the decrease in COVID-19-related deaths in older adults. It needs to be made abundantly clear to elderly people that the advantages of vaccination far outweigh any potential risks. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccination should be considered as the recommended strategy for the control of this disease by preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and related deaths in older adults. More RCTs are needed to increase the certainty of the evidence and to verify our conclusions.

We evaluated the risks of adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination among patients treated for hypothyroidism. Methods: In this retrospective population-based cohort study of Hong Kong Hospital Authority electronic health records with the Department of Health vaccination records linkage, levothyroxine (LT4) users were categorized into unvaccinated, vaccinated with BNT162b2 (mRNA vaccine), or CoronaVac (inactivated vaccine) between February 23, 2021, and September 9, 2021. Study outcomes were dosage reduction or escalation in LT4, emergency department (ED) visit, unscheduled hospitalization, adverse events of special interest (AESI) according to the World Health Organization's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, and all-cause mortality. Inverse probability of treatment weighting for propensity score was applied to balance baseline patient characteristics among the three groups. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox regression models. Patients were observed from the index date until the occurrence of study outcome, death, or censored on September 30, 2021, whichever came first. Results: In total, 47,086 LT4 users were identified (BNT162b2: n = 12,310; CoronaVac: n = 11,353; and unvaccinated: n = 23,423). COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with increased risks of LT4 dosage reduction (BNT162b2: HR = 0.971 [confidence interval; CI 0.892-1.058]; CoronaVac: HR = 0.968 [CI 0.904-1.037]) or escalation (BNT162b2: HR = 0.779 [CI 0.519-1.169]; CoronaVac: HR = 0.715 [CI 0.481-1.062]). Besides, COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with a higher risk of ED visits (BNT162b2: HR = 0.944 [CI 0.700-1.273]; CoronaVac: HR = 0.851 [CI 0.647-1.120]) or unscheduled hospitalization (BNT162b2: HR = 0.905 [CI 0.539-1.520]; CoronaVac: HR = 0.735 [CI 0.448-1.207]). There were two (0.016%) deaths and six (0.062%) AESI recorded for BNT162b2 recipients, and one (0.009%) and three (0.035%) for CoronaVac recipients, respectively. Conclusions: BNT162b2 or CoronaVac vaccination is not associated with unstable thyroid status or an increased risk of adverse outcomes among patients treated for hypothyroidism in general. These reassuring data should encourage them to get vaccinated against COVID-19 for protection from potentially worse COVID-19-related outcomes."	"1557-9077

Our objective was to determine the outcomes of concurrent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and ALI, particularly during the Delta variant surge and the impact of vaccination status. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients treated at a single health care system between March 2020 and December 2021 for ALI and recent (<14 days) COVID-19 infection or who developed ALI during hospitalization for the same disease. Patients were grouped by year as well as by pre and post Delta variant emergence in 2021 based on the World Health Organization timeline (January to May vs June to December). Baseline demographics, imaging, interventions, and outcomes were evaluated. A control cohort of all patients with ALI requiring surgical intervention for a 2-year period prior to the pandemic was used for comparison. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and amputation-free survival. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazards analysis were performed. RESULTS: Forty acutely ischemic limbs were identified in 36 patients with COVID-19, the majority during the Delta surge (52.8%) and after the wide availability of vaccines. The rate of COVID-19-associated ALI, although low overall, nearly doubled during the Delta surge (0.37% vs 0.20%; P = .09). Intervention (open or endovascular revascularization vs primary amputation) was performed on 31 limbs in 28 individuals, with the remaining eight treated with systemic anti-coagulation. Postoperative mortality was 48%, and overall mortality was 50%. Major amputation following revascularization was significantly higher with COVID-19 ALI (25% vs 3%; P = .006) compared with the pre-pandemic group. Thirty-day amputation-free survival was significantly lower (log-rank P < .001). COVID-19 infection (adjusted hazard ratio, 6.2; P < .001) and age (hazard ratio, 1.1; P = .006) were associated with 30-day amputation in multivariate analysis. Severity of COVID-19 infection, defined as vasopressor usage, was not associated with post-revascularization amputation. There was a higher incidence of re-thrombosis in the latter half of 2021 with the Delta surge, as reintervention for recurrent ischemia of the same limb was more common than our previous experience (21% vs 0%; P = .55). COVID-19-associated limb ischemia occurred almost exclusively in non-vaccinated patients (92%). CONCLUSIONS: ALI observed with Delta appears more resistant to standard therapy. Unvaccinated status correlated highly with ALI occurrence in the setting of COVID-19 infection. Information of limb loss as a COVID-19 complication among non-vaccinated patients may help to increase compliance."	"1097-6809

We leveraged a large prospective cohort, the UK-Biobank (UKBB, N ~ 397,000), and studied associations of prior use of all level-4 ATC drug categories (N = 819, including vaccines) with COVID-19 diagnosis and severity. Effects of drugs on the risk of infection, disease severity, and mortality were investigated separately. Logistic regression was conducted, controlling for main confounders. We observed strong and highly consistent protective associations with statins. Many top-listed protective drugs were also cardiovascular medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), calcium channel blocker (CCB), and beta-blockers. Some other drugs showing protective associations included biguanides (metformin), estrogens, thyroid hormones, proton pump inhibitors, and testosterone-5-alpha reductase inhibitors, among others. We also observed protective associations by influenza, pneumococcal, and several other vaccines. Subgroup and interaction analyses were also conducted, which revealed differences in protective effects in various subgroups. For example, protective effects of flu/pneumococcal vaccines were weaker in obese individuals, while protection by statins was stronger in cardiovascular patients. To conclude, our analysis revealed many drug repositioning candidates, for example several cardiovascular medications. Further studies are required for validation."	"1999-4923

Whether mAbs are effective against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, among vaccinated patients, or for prevention of mortality remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of mAb treatment in preventing progression to severe disease during the Delta phase of the pandemic and based on key baseline risk factors. DESIGN SETTING AND PATIENTS: Observational cohort study of non-hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from November 2020-October 2021, using electronic health records from a statewide health system plus state-level vaccine and mortality data. Using propensity matching, we selected approximately 2.5 patients not receiving mAbs for each patient who received mAbs. EXPOSURE: Neutralizing mAb treatment under emergency use authorization. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was 28-day hospitalization; secondary outcomes included mortality and severity of hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 36,077 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2,675 receiving mAbs were matched to 6,677 not receiving mAbs. Compared to mAb-untreated patients, mAb-treated patients had lower all-cause hospitalization (4.0% vs 7.7%; adjusted OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.38-0.60) and all-cause mortality (0.1% vs. 0.9%; adjusted OR 0.11, 95%CI 0.03-0.29) to day 28; differences persisted to day 90. Among hospitalized patients, mAb-treated patients had shorter hospital length of stay (5.8 vs. 8.5 days) and lower risk of mechanical ventilation (4.6% vs. 16.6%). Relative effectiveness was similar in preventing hospitalizations during the Delta variant phase (adjusted OR 0.35, 95%CI 0.25-0.50) and across subgroups. Lower number-needed-to-treat (NNT) to prevent hospitalization were observed for subgroups with higher baseline risk of hospitalization (e.g., multiple comorbidities (NNT=17) and not fully vaccinated (NNT=24) vs. no comorbidities (NNT=88) and fully vaccinated (NNT=81). CONCLUSION: Real-world evidence demonstrated mAb effectiveness in reducing hospitalization among COVID-19 outpatients, including during the Delta variant phase, and conferred an overall 89% reduction in 28-day mortality. Early outpatient treatment with mAbs should be prioritized, especially for individuals with highest risk for hospitalization."	"Wynia, Matthew K

However, the data regarding the protective role of vaccination in this population are still lacking. This study aimed to assess the safety of approved vaccination for patients with PH. METHODS: In this national prospective cohort study, patients diagnosed with PH (World Health Organization [WHO] groups 1 and 4) were enrolled from October 2021 to April 2022. The primary outcome was the composite of PH-related major adverse events. We used an inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach to control for possible confounding factors in the baseline characteristics of patients. RESULTS: In total, 706 patients with PH participated in this study (mean age, 40.3 years; mean duration after diagnosis of PH, 8.2 years). All patients received standardized treatment for PH in accordance with guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PH in China. Among them, 278 patients did not receive vaccination, whereas 428 patients completed the vaccination series. None of the participants were infected with COVID-19 during our study period. Overall, 398 patients received inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine, whereas 30 received recombinant protein subunit vaccine. After adjusting for baseline covariates using the IPW approach, the odds of any adverse events due to PH in the vaccinated group did not statistically significantly increase (27/428 [6.3%] vs. 24/278 [8.6%], odds ratio = 0.72, P = 0.302). Approximately half of the vaccinated patients reported at least one post-vaccination side effects, most of which were mild, including pain at the injection site (159/428, 37.1%), fever (11/428, 2.6%), and fatigue (26/428, 6.1%). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination did not significantly augment the PH-related major adverse events for patients with WHO groups 1 and 4 PH, although there were some tolerable side effects. A large-scale randomized controlled trial is warranted to confirm this finding. The final approval of the COVID-19 vaccination for patients with PH as a public health strategy is promising."

METHODS: In this rapid living systematic evidence synthesis and meta-analysis, we searched EMBASE and the US National Institutes of Health's iSearch COVID-19 Portfolio, supplemented by manual searches of COVID-19-specific sources, until Dec 1, 2022, for studies that reported vaccine effectiveness immediately and at least 112 days after a primary vaccine series or at least 84 days after a booster dose. Single reviewers assessed titles, abstracts, and full-text articles, and extracted data, with a second reviewer verifying included studies. The primary outcomes were vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalisations, and mortality, which were assessed using three-level meta-analytic models. This study is registered with the National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools, review 473. FINDINGS: We screened 16 696 records at the title and abstract level, appraised 832 (5·0%) full texts, and initially included 73 (0·4%) studies. Of these, we excluded five (7%) studies because of critical risk of bias, leaving 68 (93%) studies that were extracted for analysis. For infections caused by any SARS-CoV-2 strain, vaccine effectiveness for the primary series reduced from 83% (95% CI 80-86) at baseline (14-42 days) to 62% (53-69) by 112-139 days. Vaccine effectiveness at baseline was 92% (88-94) for hospitalisations and 91% (85-95) for mortality, and reduced to 79% (65-87) at 224-251 days for hospitalisations and 86% (73-93) at 168-195 days for mortality. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was lower for the omicron variant for infections, hospitalisations, and mortality at baseline compared with that of other variants, but subsequent reductions occurred at a similar rate across variants. For booster doses, which covered mostly omicron studies, vaccine effectiveness at baseline was 70% (56-80) against infections and 89% (82-93) against hospitalisations, and reduced to 43% (14-62) against infections and 71% (51-83) against hospitalisations at 112 days or later. Not enough studies were available to report on booster vaccine effectiveness against mortality. INTERPRETATION: Our analyses indicate that vaccine effectiveness generally decreases over time against SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalisations, and mortality. The baseline vaccine effectiveness levels for the omicron variant were notably lower than for other variants. Therefore, other preventive measures (eg, face-mask wearing and physical distancing) might be necessary to manage the pandemic in the long term.

In anticipation of the time needed for the global vaccine supply to meet all needs, the World Health Organization (WHO) published the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) Values Framework and a roadmap for prioritizing use of COVID-19 vaccines in late 2020 (4,5), followed by a strategy brief to outline urgent actions in October 2021.(†) WHO described the general principles, objectives, and priorities needed to support country planning of vaccine rollout to minimize severe disease and death. A July 2022 update to the strategy brief(§) prioritized vaccination of populations at increased risk, including older adults,(¶) with the goal of 100% coverage with a complete COVID-19 vaccination series** for at-risk populations. Using available public data on COVID-19 mortality (reported deaths and model estimates) for 2020 and 2021 and the most recent reported COVID-19 vaccination coverage data from WHO, investigators performed descriptive analyses to examine age-specific mortality and global vaccination rollout among older adults (as defined by each country), stratified by country World Bank income status. Data quality and COVID-19 death reporting frequency varied by data source; however, persons aged ≥60 years accounted for >80% of the overall COVID-19 mortality across all income groups, with upper- and lower-middle-income countries accounting for 80% of the overall estimated excess mortality. Effective COVID-19 vaccines were authorized for use in December 2020, with global supply scaled up sufficiently to meet country needs by late 2021 (6). COVID-19 vaccines are safe and highly effective in reducing severe COVID-19, hospitalizations, and mortality (7,8); nevertheless, country-reported median completed primary series coverage among adults aged ≥60 years only reached 76% by the end of 2022, substantially below the WHO goal, especially in middle- and low-income countries. Increased efforts are needed to increase primary series and booster dose coverage among all older adults as recommended by WHO and national health authorities."	"1545-861x

However, in patients with breakthrough infections requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, the effect of prior COVID-19 vaccination on mortality remains inconclusive. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed data on patients intubated due to COVID-19 pneumonia between May 1, 2022 and October 31, 2022. Receipt of two or more doses of vaccine were considered as fully vaccinated. The primary outcome was the time from intubation to all-cause intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. RESULT: A total of 84 patients were included (40 fully vaccinated versus 44 controls). The baseline characteristics, including age, comorbidities, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on the day of intubation were similar between the two groups. The difference in ICU mortality rate between the fully vaccinated and control groups was not significant (35 % vs. 25 %, P = 0.317; hazard ratio with 95 % confidence interval = 1.246 (0.575-2.666), P = 0.571). The SOFA score (hazard ratio: 1.319, P = 0.001) and body mass index (BMI) (hazard ratio: 0.883, P = 0.022) were significantly associated with ICU mortality. CONCLUSION: Being fully vaccinated was not associated with a mortality benefit in intubated patients with COVID-19. A higher SOFA score on the day of intubation and lower BMI were poor prognostic factors."	"1437-7780

Vaccination"	"Nursing home residents have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; their age, comorbidities, and exposure to a congregate setting has placed them at high risk for both infection and severe COVID-19-associated outcomes, including death (1). Receipt of a primary COVID-19 mRNA vaccination series (2) and monovalent booster doses (3) have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality in this population. Beginning in October 2022, the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) defined up-to-date vaccination as receipt of a bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose or completion of a primary series within the preceding 2 months.* The effectiveness of being up to date with COVID-19 vaccination among nursing home residents in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection is not known. This analysis used NHSN nursing home COVID-19 data reported during November 20, 2022-January 8, 2023, to describe effectiveness of up-to-date vaccination status (versus not being up to date) against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection among nursing home residents. Adjusting for calendar week, county-level COVID-19 incidence, county-level social vulnerability index (SVI), and facility-level percentage of staff members who were up to date, up-to-date vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection was 31.2% (95% CI = 29.1%-33.2%). Nursing home residents should stay up to date with recommended age-appropriate COVID-19 vaccination, which now includes an additional bivalent vaccine dose for moderately or severely immunocompromised adults aged ≥65 years to increase protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection."

This study aims to evaluate the impact of a delayed second dose on all-cause mortality and emergency services. METHODS: A territory-wide, retrospective cohort of people who had completed two doses of mRNA (BNT162b2) or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (CoronaVac) vaccine between February 23 and July 3, 2021, in Hong Kong was analyzed, with linkage to electronic health records retrieved from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority. Vaccine recipients were classified as receiving a second dose within recommended intervals (21-28 days for BNT162b2; 14-28 days for CoronaVac) or delayed. Study outcomes were all-cause mortality, emergency department (ED) visits, and unscheduled hospitalizations within 28 days after the second dose of vaccination. RESULTS: Among 417,497 BNT162b2 and 354,283 CoronaVac second dose recipients, 3.8% and 28.5% received the second dose beyond the recommended intervals (mean 34.4 and 31.8 days), respectively. During the study period, there were < 5 daily new cases of COVID-19 infections in the community. Delaying the second dose was not associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.185, 95% CI 0.478-2.937, P = 0.714), risk of ED visit (HR = 0.966, 95% CI 0.926-1.008, P = 0.113), and risk of unscheduled hospitalization (HR = 0.956, 95% CI 0.878-1.040, P = 0.294) compared to that within the recommended interval for CoronaVac recipients. No statistically significant differences in all-cause mortality (HR = 4.438, 95% CI 0.951-20.701, P = 0.058), ED visit (HR = 1.037, 95% CI 0.951-1.130, P = 0.411), and unscheduled hospitalization (HR = 1.054, 95% CI 0.867-1.281, P = 0.597) were identified between people who received a second dose of BNT162b2 within and beyond the recommended intervals. CONCLUSIONS: No significant association between delayed second dose of BNT162b2 or CoronaVac and all-cause mortality, ED visit, and unscheduled hospitalization was observed in the present cohort. Regardless of the recommended or delayed schedule for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, a second dose of both vaccines should be administered to obtain better protection against infection and serious disease. The second dose should be administered within the recommended interval following the manufacturer's product information, until further studies support the benefits of delaying vaccination outweighing the risks."

Considering the scant evidence directly comparing the safety profiles of mRNA and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, this territory-wide cohort study aims to compare the incidence of various adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and all-cause mortality between CoronaVac (inactivated vaccine) and BNT162b2 (mRNA-based vaccine). Our results can help vaccine recipients make an informed choice. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A retrospective, population-based cohort of individuals who had received at least 1 dose of BNT162b2 or CoronaVac from 23 February to 9 September 2021 in Hong Kong, and had data linkage to the electronic medical records of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, were included. Those who had received mixed doses were excluded. Individuals were observed from the date of vaccination (first or second dose) until mortality, second dose vaccination (for first dose analysis), 21 days after vaccination, or 30 September 2021, whichever came first. Baseline characteristics of vaccinated individuals were balanced between groups using propensity score weighting. Outcome events were AESIs and all-cause mortality recorded during 21 days of post-vaccination follow-up after each dose, except anaphylaxis, for which the observation period was restricted to 2 days after each dose. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of AESIs and mortality comparing between CoronaVac and BNT162b2 recipients were estimated after each dose using Poisson regression models. Among 2,333,379 vaccinated individuals aged 18 years or above, the first dose analysis included 1,308,820 BNT162b2 and 955,859 CoronaVac recipients, while the second dose analysis included 1,116,677 and 821,560 individuals, respectively. The most frequently reported AESI among CoronaVac and BNT162b2 recipients was thromboembolism (first dose: 431 and 290 per 100,000 person-years; second dose: 385 and 266 per 100,000 person-years). After the first dose, incidence rates of overall AESIs (IRR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.89-1.08, p = 0.703) and mortality (IRR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.63-1.48, p = 0.868) associated with CoronaVac were generally comparable to those for BNT162b2, except for Bell palsy (IRR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.12-3.41, p = 0.018), anaphylaxis (IRR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.79, p = 0.012), and sleeping disturbance or disorder (IRR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.49-0.89, p = 0.006). After the second dose, incidence rates of overall AESIs (IRR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.87-1.08, p = 0.545) and mortality (IRR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.51-1.40, p = 0.516) were comparable between CoronaVac and BNT162b2 recipients, with no significant differences observed for specific AESIs. The main limitations of this study include residual confounding due to its observational nature, and the possibility of its being underpowered for some AESIs with very low observed incidences. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that the incidences of AESIs (cumulative incidence rate of 0.06%-0.09%) and mortality following the first and second doses of CoronaVac and BNT162b2 vaccination were very low. The safety profiles of the vaccines were generally comparable, except for a significantly higher incidence rate of Bell palsy, but lower incidence rates of anaphylaxis and sleeping disturbance or disorder, following first dose CoronaVac versus BNT162b2 vaccination. Our results could help inform the choice of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines, mainly administered in low- and middle-income countries with large populations, in comparison to the safety of mRNA vaccines. Long-term surveillance on the safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines should continue."	"1549-1676

As variants with altered pathogenicity have emerged, uncertainty remains around how that risk has changed. We prospectively set up a dedicated post-COVID-19 clinic to monitor haematology patients infected with COVID-19 from the start of the pandemic. In total, 128 patients were identified and telephone interviews were conducted with 94 of 95 survivors. Ninety-day mortality attributed to COVID-19 has fallen sequentially from 42% for the Original and Alpha strains to 9% and to 2% for the Delta and Omicron variants respectively. Furthermore, the risk of post-COVID-19 syndrome in survivors has fallen from 46% for the Original or Alpha strains to 35% for Delta and 14% for the Omicron strain. Since vaccine uptake has been nearly universal in haematology patients, it is not possible to determine whether improved outcomes reflect the reduced pathogenicity of the virus, or widespread vaccine deployment. Whilst mortality and morbidity remain higher in haematology patients than in the general population, our data suggest that the absolute risks are now significantly lower. Given this trend, we believe clinicians should initiate conversations about risk with their patients on whether to maintain any self-imposed social isolation."	"1365-2141

Real-world data from the large-scale, government-mandated Central Vaccination Center (CVC), Thailand, could be used for comparing the breakthrough infection, across all available COVID-19 vaccination profiles. METHODS: This prospective cohort study combined the vaccine profiles from the CVC registry with three nationally validated outcome datasets to assess the breakthrough COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death among Thais individuals who received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The outcomes were analyzed by comparing vaccine profiles to investigate the shot effect and homologous effect. FINDINGS: Of 2,407,315 Thais who had at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, 63,469 (2.75%) had breakthrough infection, 42,001 (1.79%) had been hospitalized, and 431 (0.02%) died. Per one vaccination shot added, there was an 18% risk reduction of breakthrough infection (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-0.82), a 25% risk reduction of hospitalization (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.73-0.76), and a 96% risk reduction of mortality (HR 0.04, 95% CI 0.03-0.06). The heterologous two-shot vaccine profiles had a higher protective effect against infection, hospitalization, and mortality compared to the homologous counterparts. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 breakthrough infection, hospitalization, and death differ across vaccination profiles that had a different number of shots and types of vaccines. FUNDING: This study did not involve any funding."	"2772-3682

The aim of this study was to estimate the population-level risks of hospitalised thrombocytopenia and major arterial and venous thromboses after COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this whole-population cohort study, we analysed linked electronic health records from adults living in England, from 8 December 2020 to 18 March 2021. We estimated incidence rates and hazard ratios (HRs) for major arterial, venous, and thrombocytopenic outcomes 1 to 28 and >28 days after first vaccination dose for ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2 vaccines. Analyses were performed separately for ages <70 and ≥70 years and adjusted for age, age2, sex, ethnicity, and deprivation. We also prespecified adjustment for anticoagulant medication, combined oral contraceptive medication, hormone replacement therapy medication, history of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, and history of coronavirus infection in analyses of venous thrombosis; and diabetes, hypertension, smoking, antiplatelet medication, blood pressure lowering medication, lipid lowering medication, anticoagulant medication, history of stroke, and history of myocardial infarction in analyses of arterial thromboses. We selected further covariates with backward selection. Of 46 million adults, 23 million (51%) were women; 39 million (84%) were <70; and 3.7 million (8.1%) Asian or Asian British, 1.6 million (3.5%) Black or Black British, 36 million (79%) White, 0.7 million (1.5%) mixed ethnicity, and 1.5 million (3.2%) were of another ethnicity. Approximately 21 million (46%) adults had their first vaccination between 8 December 2020 and 18 March 2021. The crude incidence rates (per 100,000 person-years) of all venous events were as follows: prevaccination, 140 [95% confidence interval (CI): 138 to 142]; ≤28 days post-ChAdOx1-S, 294 (281 to 307); >28 days post-ChAdOx1-S, 359 (338 to 382), ≤28 days post-BNT162b2-S, 241 (229 to 253); >28 days post-BNT162b2-S 277 (263 to 291). The crude incidence rates (per 100,000 person-years) of all arterial events were as follows: prevaccination, 546 (95% CI: 541 to 555); ≤28 days post-ChAdOx1-S, 1,211 (1,185 to 1,237); >28 days post-ChAdOx1-S, 1678 (1,630 to 1,726), ≤28 days post-BNT162b2-S, 1,242 (1,214 to 1,269); >28 days post-BNT162b2-S, 1,539 (1,507 to 1,572). Adjusted HRs (aHRs) 1 to 28 days after ChAdOx1-S, compared with unvaccinated rates, at ages <70 and ≥70 years, respectively, were 0.97 (95% CI: 0.90 to 1.05) and 0.58 (0.53 to 0.63) for venous thromboses, and 0.90 (0.86 to 0.95) and 0.76 (0.73 to 0.79) for arterial thromboses. Corresponding aHRs for BNT162b2 were 0.81 (0.74 to 0.88) and 0.57 (0.53 to 0.62) for venous thromboses, and 0.94 (0.90 to 0.99) and 0.72 (0.70 to 0.75) for arterial thromboses. aHRs for thrombotic events were higher at younger ages for venous thromboses after ChAdOx1-S, and for arterial thromboses after both vaccines. Rates of intracranial venous thrombosis (ICVT) and of thrombocytopenia in adults aged <70 years were higher 1 to 28 days after ChAdOx1-S (aHRs 2.27, 95% CI: 1.33 to 3.88 and 1.71, 1.35 to 2.16, respectively), but not after BNT162b2 (0.59, 0.24 to 1.45 and 1.00, 0.75 to 1.34) compared with unvaccinated. The corresponding absolute excess risks of ICVT 1 to 28 days after ChAdOx1-S were 0.9 to 3 per million, varying by age and sex. The main limitations of the study are as follows: (i) it relies on the accuracy of coded healthcare data to identify exposures, covariates, and outcomes; (ii) the use of primary reason for hospital admission to measure outcome, which improves the positive predictive value but may lead to an underestimation of incidence; and (iii) potential unmeasured confounding. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed increases in rates of ICVT and thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1-S vaccination in adults aged <70 years that were small compared with its effect in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, although more precise estimates for adults aged <40 years are needed. For people aged ≥70 years, rates of arterial or venous thrombotic events were generally lower after either vaccine compared with unvaccinated, suggesting that either vaccine is suitable in this age group."

COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness estimates against severe endpoints among individuals with clinical conditions that place them at increased risk of critical disease are limited. METHODS: We used English primary care medical record data from the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre sentinel network (N > 18 million). Data were linked to the National Immunisation Management Service database, Second Generation Surveillance System for virology test data, Hospital Episode Statistics, and death registry data. We estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness (aVE) against COVID-19 infection followed by hospitalisation and death among individuals in specific clinical risk groups using a cohort design during the delta-dominant period. We also report mortality statistics and results from our antibody surveillance in this population. FINDINGS: aVE against severe endpoints was high, 14-69d following a third dose aVE was 96.4% (95.1%-97.4%) and 97.9% (97.2%-98.4%) for clinically vulnerable people given a Vaxzevria and Comirnaty primary course respectively. Lower aVE was observed in the immunosuppressed group: 88.6% (79.1%-93.8%) and 91.9% (85.9%-95.4%) for Vaxzevria and Comirnaty respectively. Antibody levels were significantly lower among the immunosuppressed group than those not in this risk group across all vaccination types and doses. The standardised case fatality rate within 28 days of a positive test was 3.9/1000 in people not in risk groups, compared to 12.8/1000 in clinical risk groups. Waning aVE with time since 2nd dose was also demonstrated, for example, Comirnaty aVE against hospitalisation reduced from 96.0% (95.1-96.7%) 14-69days post-dose 2-82.9% (81.4-84.2%) 182days+ post-dose 2. INTERPRETATION: In all clinical risk groups high levels of vaccine effectiveness against severe endpoints were seen. Reduced vaccine effectiveness was noted among the immunosuppressed group."

*Vaccines"	"BACKGROUND: The first COVID-19 vaccine outside a clinical trial setting was administered on Dec 8, 2020. To ensure global vaccine equity, vaccine targets were set by the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility and WHO. However, due to vaccine shortfalls, these targets were not achieved by the end of 2021. We aimed to quantify the global impact of the first year of COVID-19 vaccination programmes. METHODS: A mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission and vaccination was separately fit to reported COVID-19 mortality and all-cause excess mortality in 185 countries and territories. The impact of COVID-19 vaccination programmes was determined by estimating the additional lives lost if no vaccines had been distributed. We also estimated the additional deaths that would have been averted had the vaccination coverage targets of 20% set by COVAX and 40% set by WHO been achieved by the end of 2021. FINDINGS: Based on official reported COVID-19 deaths, we estimated that vaccinations prevented 14·4 million (95% credible interval [Crl] 13·7-15·9) deaths from COVID-19 in 185 countries and territories between Dec 8, 2020, and Dec 8, 2021. This estimate rose to 19·8 million (95% Crl 19·1-20·4) deaths from COVID-19 averted when we used excess deaths as an estimate of the true extent of the pandemic, representing a global reduction of 63% in total deaths (19·8 million of 31·4 million) during the first year of COVID-19 vaccination. In COVAX Advance Market Commitment countries, we estimated that 41% of excess mortality (7·4 million [95% Crl 6·8-7·7] of 17·9 million deaths) was averted. In low-income countries, we estimated that an additional 45% (95% CrI 42-49) of deaths could have been averted had the 20% vaccination coverage target set by COVAX been met by each country, and that an additional 111% (105-118) of deaths could have been averted had the 40% target set by WHO been met by each country by the end of 2021. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 vaccination has substantially altered the course of the pandemic, saving tens of millions of lives globally. However, inadequate access to vaccines in low-income countries has limited the impact in these settings, reinforcing the need for global vaccine equity and coverage.

METHODS: We considered 295 691 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 at Cleveland Clinic between 1 October 2021 and 31 January 2022. We used logistic regression to investigate the association of vaccination and prior infection with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and used Cox regression to investigate the association of vaccination, prior infection, and monoclonal antibody therapy with the risks of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and death. RESULTS: Vaccination and prior infection were less effective against Omicron than Delta infection but provided strong protection against ICU admission and death. Boosting greatly increased vaccine effectiveness against Omicron infection and severe outcomes, although effectiveness waned rapidly over time. Monoclonal antibody therapy considerably reduced risks of ICU admission and death. The relatively low mortality of the Omicron variant was due to both reduced lethality of this variant and increased population immunity acquired from booster vaccination and previous infection. CONCLUSIONS: Booster vaccination and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection provide strong protection against ICU admission and death from Omicron infection. Monoclonal antibody therapy is also beneficial."

IC individuals generate a lower immune response after vaccination in general, and the US CDC recommended a third dose of either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccines as part of their primary series. Influenza vaccine trials have shown that increasing dosage could improve effectiveness in IC populations. The objective of this systematic literature review and pairwise meta-analysis was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of mRNA-1273 (50 or 100 mcg/dose) vs BNT162b2 (30 mcg/dose) in IC populations using the GRADE framework. METHODS: The systematic literature search was conducted in the World Health Organization COVID-19 Research Database. Studies were included in the pairwise meta-analysis if they reported comparisons of mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 in IC individuals ≥18 years of age; outcomes of interest were symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization due to COVID-19, and mortality due to COVID-19. Risk ratios (RR) were pooled across studies using random-effects meta-analysis models. Outcomes were also analyzed in subgroups of patients with cancer, autoimmune disease, and solid organ transplant. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Evidence was evaluated using the GRADE framework. RESULTS: Overall, 17 studies were included in the pairwise meta-analysis. Compared with BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 was associated with significantly reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75-0.97]; P=0.0151; I(2 )= 67.7%), severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.77-0.93]; P=0.0009; I(2 )= 0%), COVID-19-associated hospitalization (RR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.79-0.97]; P<0.0001; I(2 )= 0%), and COVID-19-associated mortality (RR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.44-0.90]; P=0.0119; I(2 )= 0%) in IC populations. Results were consistent across subgroups. Because of sample size limitations, relative effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in IC populations cannot be studied in randomized trials. Based on nonrandomized studies, evidence certainty among comparisons was type 3 (low) and 4 (very low), reflecting potential biases in observational studies. CONCLUSION: This GRADE meta-analysis based on a large number of consistent observational studies showed that the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine is associated with improved clinical effectiveness in IC populations compared with BNT162b2."

Two major variants Delta and Omicron are investigated respectively. The main method used in the research is the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA). We use Δα as the evaluation of control effectiveness. In the transmission stages of Delta and Omicron, we observe whether Δα shows a downward trend by gradually expanding the length of time series. Vaccine effectiveness is evaluated using a time series of newly diagnosed patients and newly reported deaths. Data samples are taken from 9 different countries. According to the obtained results, the vaccine controls infectivity and mortality of the virus in the Delta transmission stage, but infectivity control is less effective than mortality. In the Omicron transmission stage, the immune effect of the vaccine is not obvious, which may be related to the high infectivity of Omicron. However, the vaccine is still effective in controlling mortality. We also find that the immune effect of vaccine on Omicron was lower than that of Delta. Finally, we observe that the immune effect of the vaccine in 'Poland' was abnormal. By analyzing the vaccination curve, we conclude that in 'Poland', when the growth rate of vaccination rate slowed down, the immune effect of the vaccine was very poor in terms of pathogenicity and lethality. Therefore, we suggest that all countries should continue to strengthen the vaccination rate. A higher or faster growth rate of vaccination rate will help control the infectivity and mortality rate, especially in the effectiveness of controlling mortality. Our research can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines for epidemic prevention and control, the formulation of epidemic prevention measures and vaccination policies for different countries with respect to their current pandemic situation accordingly."

SARS-CoV-2 variant"	"INTRODUCTION: Breakthrough COVID-19 may occur in vaccinated people, and may result from declining vaccine effectiveness or highly transmittable SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as the B.167.2 (delta) variant. We investigated risk factors and outcomes for infection with the delta variant among vaccinated hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Patients on maintenance hemodialysis who received two doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine were analysed according to having developed COVID-19 (study group) or not (control group), in a retrospective, observational, comparative study. We compared risk-factors for developing breakthrough COVID-19 and assessed clinical outcomes, including 30-day mortality rates. RESULTS: Twenty-four cases of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared to 91 controls without infection. Breakthrough infection was associated with chronic immunosuppressive treatment, hematological malignancies, and low antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. All COVID-19 cases occurred at least 5 months after vaccination, and most were caused by the B.1.617.2 variant (at least 23/24 cases). COVID-19 was categorized as severe or critical disease in 11/24 patients (46%), and 54% required hospitalization and COVID-19-directed treatment. The source of infection was nosocomial in 6/24 cases (25%), and healthcare-related in 3/24 (12.5%). Mortality rate was 21%. Overall mortality was significantly higher in patients who developed COVID-19 than in controls (odds ratio for all-cause mortality 7.6, 95% CI 1.4-41, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Breakthrough COVID-19 with the B.1.617.2 variant can occur in vaccinated hemodialysis patients and is associated with immunosuppression and weaker humoral response to vaccination. Infections may be nosocomial and result in significant morbidity and mortality."	"1724-6059

Therefore, this retrospective cohort study examines the short-term and long-term risks of post-infection CVD among COVID-19 patients with different vaccination status utilizing data from electronic health databases in Hong Kong. Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted with inverse probability of treatment weighting is used to evaluate the risks of incident CVD (coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure) and all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients. Compared with unvaccinated patients, vaccinated patients have a lower risk of CVD and all-cause mortality, and the lowest risk is observed in those who completed three doses of vaccine. Similar patterns in the subgroups of different vaccine platforms, age, gender, Charlson comorbidity index, and disease severity are observed. These findings highlight a positive dose-response relationship between overall CVD risk reduction and the number of vaccine doses received."	"2666-3791

METHODS: This case-control study analyzed data available between January and March 2022 from the electronic health databases in Hong Kong and enrolled individuals aged 60 or above. Each case was matched with up to 10 controls by age, sex, index date and Charlson Comorbidity Index for the four outcomes (COVID-19 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalization, severe complications, and all-cause mortality) independently. Conditional logistic regression was conducted to evaluate VE of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac against COVID-19-related outcomes within 28 days after COVID-19 infection among participants stratified by age groups (60-79, ≥80 years old). RESULTS: A dose-response relationship between the number of vaccine doses received and protection against severe or fatal disease was observed. Highest VE (95% CI) against COVID-19 infection was observed in individuals aged ≥80 who received three doses of BNT162b2 [75.5% (73.1-77.7%)] or three doses of CoronaVac [53.9% (51.0-56.5%)] compared to those in the younger age group who received three doses of BNT162b2 [51.1% (49.9-52.4%)] or three doses of CoronaVac [2.0% (-0.1-4.1%)]. VE (95% CI) was higher for other outcomes, reaching 91.9% (89.4-93.8%) and 86.7% (84.3-88.8%) against COVID-19-related hospitalization; 85.8% (61.2-94.8%) and 89.8% (72.4-96.3%) against COVID-19-related severe complications; and 96.4% (92.9-98.2%) and 95.0% (92.1-96.8%) against COVID-19-related mortality after three doses of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac in older vaccine recipients, respectively. A similar dose-response relationship was established in younger vaccine recipients and after stratification by sex and Charlson Comorbidity Index. CONCLUSION: Both BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccination were effective in protecting older adults against COVID-19 infection and COVID-19-related severe outcomes amidst the Omicron BA.2 pandemic, and VE increased further with the third dose."

OBJECTIVE: To assess political party affiliation and mortality rates for individuals during the initial 22 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional comparison of excess mortality between registered Republican and Democratic voters between March 2020 and December 2021 adjusted for age and state of voter registration was conducted. Voter and mortality data from Florida and Ohio in 2017 linked to mortality records for January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021, were used in data analysis. EXPOSURES: Political party affiliation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Excess weekly deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic adjusted for age, county, party affiliation, and seasonality. RESULTS: Between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2021, there were 538 159 individuals in Ohio and Florida who died at age 25 years or older in the study sample. The median age at death was 78 years (IQR, 71-89 years). Overall, the excess death rate for Republican voters was 2.8 percentage points, or 15%, higher than the excess death rate for Democratic voters (95% prediction interval [PI], 1.6-3.7 percentage points). After May 1, 2021, when vaccines were available to all adults, the excess death rate gap between Republican and Democratic voters widened from -0.9 percentage point (95% PI, -2.5 to 0.3 percentage points) to 7.7 percentage points (95% PI, 6.0-9.3 percentage points) in the adjusted analysis; the excess death rate among Republican voters was 43% higher than the excess death rate among Democratic voters. The gap in excess death rates between Republican and Democratic voters was larger in counties with lower vaccination rates and was primarily noted in voters residing in Ohio. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, an association was observed between political party affiliation and excess deaths in Ohio and Florida after COVID-19 vaccines were available to all adults. These findings suggest that differences in vaccination attitudes and reported uptake between Republican and Democratic voters may have been factors in the severity and trajectory of the pandemic in the US."

METHODS: With the approval of NHS England we analysed primary care data from >17 million patients in England linked to emergency care, hospital admission and mortality records in the OpenSAFELY platform. Separately for each vaccine brand, we used a self-controlled case series design to estimate the incidence rate ratio for each outcome in the period following vaccination (4-42 days for GBS, 4-28 days for transverse myelitis and Bell's palsy) compared to a within-person baseline, using conditional Poisson regression. RESULTS: Among 7,783,441 ChAdOx1 vaccinees, there was an increased rate of GBS (N = 517; incidence rate ratio 2·85; 95% CI2·33-3·47) and Bell's palsy (N = 5,350; 1·39; 1·27-1·53) following a first dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine, corresponding to 11.0 additional cases of GBS and 17.9 cases of Bell's palsy per 1 million vaccinees if causal. For GBS this applied to the first, but not the second, dose. There was no clear evidence of an association of ChAdOx1 vaccination with transverse myelitis (N = 199; 1·51; 0·96-2·37). Among 5,729,152 BNT162b2 vaccinees, there was no evidence of any association with GBS (N = 283; 1·09; 0·75-1·57), transverse myelitis (N = 109; 1·62; 0·86-3·03) or Bell's palsy (N = 3,609; 0·89; 0·76-1·03). Among 255,446 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients there was no evidence of an association with Bell's palsy (N = 78; 0·88, 0·32-2·42). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccines save lives, but it is important to understand rare adverse events. We observed a short-term increased rate of Guillain-Barré syndrome and Bell's palsy after first dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine. The absolute risk, assuming a causal effect attributable to vaccination, was low."	"1873-2518

However, questions remain regarding its performance in high-risk healthcare occupations and work locations. We describe the effect of a COVID-19 HCP vaccination campaign on SARS-CoV-2 infection by timing of vaccination, job type, and work location. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance, incidence of postvaccination COVID-19, hospitalization, and mortality among 16,156 faculty, students, and staff at a large academic medical center. Data were collected 8 weeks prior to the start of phase 1a vaccination of frontline employees and ended 11 weeks after campaign onset. RESULTS: The COVID-19 incidence rate among HCP at our institution decreased from 3.2% during the 8 weeks prior to the start of vaccinations to 0.38% by 4 weeks after campaign initiation. COVID-19 risk was reduced among individuals who received a single vaccination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.68; P < .0001) and was further reduced with 2 doses of vaccine (HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.09-0.32; P < .0001). By 2 weeks after the second dose, the observed case positivity rate was 0.04%. Among phase 1a HCP, we observed a lower risk of COVID-19 among physicians and a trend toward higher risk for respiratory therapists independent of vaccination status. Rates of infection were similar in a subgroup of nurses when examined by work location. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show the real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in HCP. Despite these encouraging results, unvaccinated HCP remain at an elevated risk of infection, highlighting the need for targeted outreach to combat vaccine hesitancy."	"1559-6834

SARS-Cov-2"	"INTRODUCTION: Older adults are subject to higher COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. Safety and immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901, a protein subunit vaccine have been demonstrated in phase 2 clinical trial for the general population, and negative correlations have been observed between immune responses and age, however, older adults were under-represented. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, multi-center study compared safety and immunogenicity of high-dose (25 mcg) to mid-dose (15 mcg) of MVC-COV1901 administered 2 times 28 days apart in 420 participants of 65 years and older. The results have been stratified by the comorbidity status. RESULTS: Both high and mid-dose regimens elicited mostly mild adverse events and robust immune responses when measured as neutralizing and binding antibodies titers. High doses elicited better immune responses in the group without comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Given the general population-associated safety and immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901, we recommend high dose for immunization of elder adults with MVC-COV1901. The clinical trial was registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ (NCT04822025)."	"1878-3511

Booster vaccines were offered for the vulnerable population starting from August 2021. METHODS: The nationwide HUN-VE 3 study examined the effectiveness and durability of primary immunization and single booster vaccinations in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, Covid-19 related hospitalization and mortality during the Delta wave, compared to an unvaccinated control population without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The study population included 8,087,988 individuals who were 18-100 years old at the beginning of the pandemic. During the Delta wave, after adjusting for age, sex, calendar day, and chronic diseases, vaccine effectiveness (VE) of primary vaccination against registered SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 11% to 77% and 18% to 79% 14-120 days after primary immunization in the 16-64 and 65-100 years age cohort respectively, while it decreased to close to zero in the younger age group and around 40% or somewhat less in the elderly after 6 months for almost all vaccine types. In the population aged 65-100 years, we found high, 88.1%-92.5% adjusted effectiveness against Covid-19 infection after the Pfizer-BioNTech, and 92.2%-95.6% after the Moderna booster dose, while Sinopharm and Janssen booster doses provided 26.5%-75.3% and 72.9%-100.0% adjusted VE, respectively. Adjusted VE against Covid-19 related hospitalization was high within 14-120 days for Pfizer-BioNTech: 76.6%, Moderna: 83.8%, Sputnik-V: 78.3%, AstraZeneca: 73.8%, while modest for Sinopharm: 45.7% and Janssen: 26.4%. The waning of protection against Covid-19 related hospitalization was modest and booster vaccination with mRNA vaccines or the Janssen vaccine increased adjusted VE up to almost 100%, while the Sinopharm booster dose proved to be less effective. VE against Covid-19 related death after primary immunization was high or moderate: for Pfizer-BioNTech: 81.5%, Moderna: 93.2%, Sputnik-V: 100.0%, AstraZeneca: 84.8%, Sinopharm: 58.6%, Janssen: 53.3%). VE against this outcome also showed a moderate decline over time, while booster vaccine types restored effectiveness up to almost 100%, except for the Sinopharm booster. CONCLUSIONS: The HUN-VE 3 study demonstrated waning VE with all vaccine types for all examined outcomes during the Delta wave and confirmed the outstanding benefit of booster vaccination with the mRNA or Janssen vaccines, and this is the first study to provide clear and comparable effectiveness results for six different vaccine types after primary immunization against severe during the Delta pandemic wave."

Real-world study
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection"	"Objectives The Hungarian vaccination campaign was conducted with five different vaccines during the third wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2021. This observational study (HUN-VE: Hungarian Vaccine Effectiveness) estimated vaccine effectiveness against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19-related mortality in 3.7 million vaccinated individuals. Methods Incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related mortality were calculated using data from the National Public Health Centre surveillance database. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was calculated as 1 – incidence rate ratio ≥7 days after the second dose for each available vaccine versus an unvaccinated control group using mixed-effect negative binomial regression controlling for age, sex and calendar day. Results Between 22 January 2021 and 10 June 2021, 3 740 066 Hungarian individuals received two doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), HB02 (Sinopharm), Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik-V), AZD1222 (AstraZeneca), or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines. Incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related death were 1.73–9.3/100 000 person-days and 0.04–0.65/100 000 person-days in the fully vaccinated population, respectively. Estimated adjusted effectiveness varied between 68.7% (95% CI 67.2%–70.1%) and 88.7% (95% CI 86.6%–90.4%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and between 87.8% (95% CI 86.1%–89.4%) and 97.5% (95% CI 95.6%–98.6%) against COVID-19-related death, with 100% effectiveness in individuals aged 16–44 years for all vaccines. Conclusions Our observational study demonstrated the high or very high effectiveness of five different vaccines in the prevention SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related death."

This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of RT PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases in vaccinated HCWs, at a COVID clinic in a medical college hospital. This single-center, prospective cohort study included HCWs who received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and tested positive for COVID-19 within 6 months. Data on demographics, symptoms, work category, COVID-19 vaccination interval, and infection severity were collected. Of 2381 vaccinated HCWs, 105 tested positive and were categorized as mild, moderate, or severe cases. Among vaccinated HCWs, 4.41% had post-vaccine COVID-19 infections. All 105 cases received the first dose, and 79 received the second dose. Of the cases, 47.6% were partially vaccinated, and 53.3% were breakthrough cases. The mean age was 30.90±8.69 years, with 63.8% male and 36.2% female cases. Most cases (85.7%) acquired infection in the hospital, and 47.6% had direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Common symptoms included fatigue (85.7%), fever (82.9%), and cough (64.8%). Among cases, 93.3% were mild, 5.7% were moderate, and 0.9% were severe. Hospital admission and supplemental oxygen therapy were required for moderate and severe cases. No mortality was reported. Certain variables were associated with age, preventive measures, workplace type, symptoms, and comorbidities. Breakthrough infections can occur among fully vaccinated HCWs but with reduced severity and mortality. Monitoring and infection control measures remain crucial even in vaccinated individuals. This study provides insights into clinical presentations, oxygen therapy requirements, and outcomes of post-vaccine COVID-19 cases among HCWs. The data will inform strategies for booster doses to prevent COVID-19."	"1844-3117

In a cohort of adult patients testing positive for COVID-19 between December 10, 2020 and April 4, 2022, we compared the cumulative incidence of BTCo in a non-ISC population to SOT recipients (overall and by organ type) using the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) including data from 36 sites across the United States. We assessed the risk of complications post-BTCo in vaccinated SOT recipients versus SOT with unconfirmed vaccination status (UVS) using multivariable Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression. BTCo occurred in 4776 vaccinated SOT recipients over a median of 149 days (IQR 99-233), with the highest cumulative incidence in heart recipients. The relative risk of BTCo was greatest in SOT recipients (relative to non-ISC) during the pre-Delta period (HR 2.35, 95% CI 1.80-3.08). The greatest relative benefit with vaccination for both non-ISC and SOT cohorts was in BTCo mortality (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.36-0.39 for non-ISC; HR 0.67, 95% 0.57-0.78 for SOT relative to UVS). While the relative benefit of vaccine was less in SOT than non-ISC, SOT patients still exhibited significant benefit with vaccination."	"1600-6143

We aimed to examine the effects on maternal and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy, and evaluate vaccine effectiveness, when omicron (B.1.1.529) was the variant of concern. METHODS: INTERCOVID-2022 is a large, prospective, observational study, involving 41 hospitals across 18 countries. Each woman with real-time PCR or rapid test, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in pregnancy was compared with two unmatched women without a COVID-19 diagnosis who were recruited concomitantly and consecutively in pregnancy or at delivery. Mother and neonate dyads were followed until hospital discharge. Primary outcomes were maternal morbidity and mortality index (MMMI), severe neonatal morbidity index (SNMI), and severe perinatal morbidity and mortality index (SPMMI). Vaccine effectiveness was estimated, adjusted by maternal risk profile. FINDINGS: We enrolled 4618 pregnant women from Nov 27, 2021 (the day after WHO declared omicron a variant of concern), to June 30, 2022: 1545 (33%) women had a COVID-19 diagnosis (median gestation 36·7 weeks [IQR 29·0-38·9]) and 3073 (67%) women, with similar demographic characteristics, did not have a COVID-19 diagnosis. Overall, women with a diagnosis had an increased risk for MMMI (relative risk [RR] 1·16 [95% CI 1·03-1·31]) and SPMMI (RR 1·21 [95% CI 1·00-1·46]). Women with a diagnosis, compared with those without a diagnosis, also had increased risks of SNMI (RR 1·23 [95% CI 0·88-1·71]), although the lower bounds of the 95% CI crossed unity. Unvaccinated women with a COVID-19 diagnosis had a greater risk of MMMI (RR 1·36 [95% CI 1·12-1·65]). Severe COVID-19 symptoms in the total sample increased the risk of severe maternal complications (RR 2·51 [95% CI 1·84-3·43]), perinatal complications (RR 1·84 [95% CI 1·02-3·34]), and referral, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death (RR 11·83 [95% CI 6·67-20·97]). Severe COVID-19 symptoms in unvaccinated women increased the risk of MMMI (RR 2·88 [95% CI 2·02-4·12]) and referral, ICU admission, or death (RR 20·82 [95% CI 10·44-41·54]). 2886 (63%) of 4618 total participants had at least a single dose of any vaccine, and 2476 (54%) of 4618 had either complete or booster doses. Vaccine effectiveness (all vaccines combined) for severe complications of COVID-19 for all women with a complete regimen was 48% (95% CI 22-65) and 76% (47-89) after a booster dose. For women with a COVID-19 diagnosis, vaccine effectiveness of all vaccines combined for women with a complete regimen was 74% (95% CI 48-87) and 91% (65-98) after a booster dose. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 in pregnancy, during the first 6 months of omicron as the variant of concern, was associated with increased risk of severe maternal morbidity and mortality, especially among symptomatic and unvaccinated women. Women with complete or boosted vaccine doses had reduced risk for severe symptoms, complications, and death. Vaccination coverage among pregnant women remains a priority. FUNDING: None."	"1474-547x

Vulnerable population"	"BACKGROUND: To inform future preventive measures including repeated vaccinations, we have searched for a clinically useful immune correlate of protection against fatal COVID-19 among nursing homes residents. METHODS: We performed repeated capillary blood sampling with analysis of S-binding IgG in an open cohort of nursing home residents in Sweden. We analyzed immunological and registry data from 16 September 2021 to 31 August 2022 with follow-up of deaths to 30 September 2022. The study period included implementation of the 3rd and 4th mRNA monovalent vaccine doses and Omicron virus waves. FINDINGS: A total of 3012 nursing home residents with median age 86 were enrolled. The 3rd mRNA dose elicited a 99-fold relative increase of S-binding IgG in blood and corresponding increase of neutralizing antibodies. The 4th mRNA vaccine dose boosted levels 3.8-fold. Half-life of S-binding IgG was 72 days. A total 528 residents acquired their first SARS-CoV-2 infection after the 3rd or the 4th vaccine dose and the associated 30-day mortality was 9.1%. We found no indication that levels of vaccine-induced antibodies protected against infection with Omicron VOCs. In contrast, the risk of death was inversely correlated to levels of S-directed IgG below the 20th percentile. The death risk plateaued at population average above the lower 35th percentile of S-binding IgG. INTERPRETATION: In the absence of neutralizing antibodies that protect from infection, quantification of S-binding IgG post vaccination may be useful to identify the most vulnerable for fatal COVID-19 among the oldest and frailest. This information is of importance for future strategies to protect vulnerable populations against neutralization resistant variants of concern.

Mortality"	"Background: Vaccination against COVID-19 in Brazil started in January 2021, with health workers and the elderly as the priority groups. We assessed whether there was an impact of vaccinations on the mortality of elderly individuals in a context of wide transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 gamma (P.1) variant. Methods: By May 15, 2021, 238,414 COVID-19 deaths had been reported to the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Denominators for mortality rates were calculated by correcting population estimates for all-cause deaths reported in 2020. Proportionate mortality at ages 70-79 and 80+ years relative to deaths at all ages were calculated for deaths due to COVID-19 and to other causes, as were COVID-19 mortality rate ratios relative to individuals aged 0-69 years. Vaccine coverage data were obtained from the Ministry of Health. All results were tabulated by epidemiological weeks 1-19, 2021. Findings: The proportion of all COVID-19 deaths at ages 80+ years was over 25% in weeks 1-6 and declined rapidly to 12.4% in week 19, whereas proportionate COVID-19 mortality for individuals aged 70-79 years started to decline by week 15. Trends in proportionate mortality due to other causes remained stable. Mortality rates were over 13 times higher in the 80+ years age group compared to that of 0-69 year olds up to week 6, and declined to 5.0 times in week 19. Vaccination coverage (first dose) of 90% was reached by week 9 for individuals aged 80+ years and by week 13 for those aged 70-79 years. Coronavac accounted for 65.4% and AstraZeneca for 29.8% of all doses administered in weeks 1-4, compared to 36.5% and 53.3% in weeks 15-19, respectively. Interpretation: Rapid scaling up of vaccination coverage among elderly Brazilians was associated with important declines in relative mortality compared to younger individuals, in a setting where the gamma variant predominates. Had mortality rates among the elderly remained proportionate to what was observed up to week 6, an estimated additional 43,802 COVID-related deaths would have been expected up to week 19.

Pandemic"	"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a pandemic of unprecedented proportions in recent human history. To date, the world has paid a high toll in terms of human lives lost, and on economic, financial, and social repercussions. In Europe, countries tried to mobilize all resources available to contain the COVID-19 effects, but the outcomes are diverse across countries. There have also been massive efforts geared towards finding safe and effective vaccines and to distribute them massively to the population. The main objective of this paper is to describe the COVID-19 prevalence in Europe. Secondly, it aims to identify epidemiological typologies allowing to distinguish the countries in terms of their response to the pandemic, and finally assess the effect of vaccination on pandemic control. METHODS: The study covers 30 European countries: EU 27 in addition to Norway, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. Four epidemiological variables are analyzed at two distinct moments, at the end of 2020 and at the beginning of 2022: total number of cases per million, total number of deaths per million, total number of tests per thousand, and case fatality rate. In a second step, it uses a fuzzy approach, namely archetypal analysis, to identify epidemiological typologies, and positions countries by their response to the pandemic. Finally, it assesses how vaccination, stringency measures, booster doses and population age affect the case fatality rate, using a multiple regression model. RESULTS: The outcomes unveil four epidemiological typologies for both periods. The clearest sign of change in the two periods concerns the case fatality rate that is found to be low in a single typology in 2020 but occurs in three typologies in 2022, although to different degrees. There is also statistical evidence of the positive impact of the primary vaccination on mortality reduction; however, the same does not hold for the booster dose and stringency measures. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that primary vaccination is the most effective measure to reduce mortality by COVID-19 suggesting that vaccination provides hope for an end to the pandemic. However, a worldwide access to vaccination is needed to make this happen."	"1471-2458

This study aimed to describe the vaccination status and comorbidities of COVID-19 all-cause deaths. METHODS: This descriptive observational study was conducted at a tertiary care center in western India. A total of 310, RT-PCR positive COVID-19 deaths, aged 45 years and above irrespective of the cause of death (all-cause mortality), were included in the study. Death after breakthrough infection was defined as death in patient with disease onset after 14 days of the second dose of vaccine. RESULTS: Diabetes was the most common comorbidity found in 17.1% of the deaths, followed by hypertension. Cardiovascular disease and renal disease were other common comorbidities seen in 8.7% and 4.83% deaths respectively. Other less common comorbidities include neurological disorders, HIV, autoimmune disorders. Out of these 310 deaths, 21.4% of patients developed disease within 14 days of the first dose. Death after true breakthrough infection (after 14 days of both doses) was seen in only two patients (0.6%). One of these two patients was aged 60 years and had diabetes, while the other was aged 72 years and had a history of smoking. CONCLUSION: Diabetes and hypertension were the most common comorbidities, indicating a higher risk of mortality among comorbid patients. Only a small proportion of deaths (0.6%) occurred after breakthrough infection beyond 14 days of two doses. COVID-19 vaccines have shown promising efficacy against severe disease, thus high vaccination coverage needs to be achieved to prevent morbidity and mortality."

This study demonstrated the success of vaccination in controlling COVID-19 cases and deaths in a small city (41 424 people) with a low population density in Brazil. This study was based on a 1-year dataset since the application of the first dose in January 2021. The results show a reduction in positive cases and deaths as the vaccination coverage increased in the city, mainly after 15 000 inhabitants were vaccinated (35.21% of the population) in July 2021. At the time, 49.06% of administered vaccines were ChAdOx1-S recombinant, 39.80% inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus (CZ02 strain), 9.70% Tozinameran, and 1.44% Ad26.COV2-S recombinant. From August 2021, a marked reduction in daily positive cases and deaths was observed, and incidence (≤2.49 per 1000 inhabitants) and mortality (≤0.02 per 1000 inhabitants) rates remained stabilized until January 2022, when a new outbreak occurred upon the emergence of the Omicron variant. However, the mortality rate (0.07 per 1000 inhabitants) remained low regardless of the Omicron high incidence rate (68.41 per 1000 inhabitants). These data demonstrate the COVID-19 vaccination effectiveness with a threshold of 35.21% of the population vaccinated in this city model."	"1096-9071

This study aimed to identify how the numbers of new deaths and new cases per million changed after half of the population had been vaccinated. This paper used actual pandemic consequence variables (death and infected rates) together with vaccination uptake rates from 127 countries to shed new light on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. The 50% uptake rate was chosen as the threshold to estimate the real benefits of vaccination campaigns for reducing COVID-19 infection and death cases using the difference-in-differences (DiD) imputation estimator. In addition, a number of control variables, such as government interventions and people's mobility patterns during the pandemic, were also included in the study. The number of new deaths per million significantly decreased after half of the population was vaccinated, but the number of new cases did not change significantly. We found that the effects were more pronounced in Europe and North America than in other continents. Our results remain robust after using other proxies and testing the sensitivity of the vaccinated proportion. We show the causal evidence of significantly lower death rates in countries where half of the population is vaccinated globally. This paper expresses the importance of vaccine campaigns in saving human lives during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its results can be used to communicate the benefits of vaccines and to fight vaccine hesitancy."

However, the antibody response is impaired after three vaccinations in LTx patients. We questioned whether this response might be increased, and therefore studied the serological IgG antibody response across up to five doses of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In addition, risk factors for non-response were investigated. METHODS: In this large retrospective cohort study, antibody responses were assessed after 1-5 mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in all LTx patients between February 2021 and September 2022. A positive vaccine response was defined as an IgG level ≥ 300 BAU/mL. Positive antibody responses due to COVID-19 infection were excluded from the analysis. Outcome and clinical parameters were compared between responders and non-responders, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the risk factors for vaccine-response failure. RESULTS: The antibody responses of 292 LTx patients were analyzed. Positive antibody response to 1-5 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations occurred in 0%, 15%, 36%, 46%, and 51%, respectively. During the study period, 146/292 (50%) of the vaccinated individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The COVID-19-related mortality was 2.7% (4/146), and all four patients were non-responders. Risk factors associated with non-response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in univariable analyses were age (p = 0.004), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (p = 0.006), and shorter time since transplantation (p = 0.047). In the multivariable analysis, they were CKD (p = 0.043), and shorter time since transplantation (p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: A two- to five-dose regime of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in LTx patients increases the probability of vaccine response and results in a cumulative vaccine response in 51% of the LTx population. LTx patient antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations is therefore impaired, especially in patients shortly after LTx, patients with CKD, and the elderly."	"2077-0383

Vaccine effectiveness"	"BACKGROUND: Elderly people in long-term care facilities (LTCF) are at higher risk for (severe) COVID-19, yet evidence of vaccine effectiveness (VE) in this population is scarce. In November 2021 (Delta period), a COVID-19 outbreak occurred at a LTCF in the Netherlands, continuing despite measures and booster vaccination campaign. We investigated the outbreak to assess VE of primary COVID-19 vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality, and to describe the impact of the booster vaccination. METHODS: We calculated attack rate (AR) and case fatality (CF) per vaccination status (unvaccinated, primarily vaccinated and boostered). We calculated VE - at on average 6 months after vaccination - as 1- risk ratio (RR) using the crude risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between vaccination status (primary vaccination versus unvaccinated) and outcomes (SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality < 30 days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: The overall AR was 67% (70/105). CF was 33% (2/6) among unvaccinated cases, 12% among primarily vaccinated (7/58) and 0% (0/5) among boostered. The VE of primary vaccination was 17% (95% CI -28%; 46%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection and 70% (95% CI -44%; 96%) against mortality. Among boostered residents (N = 55), there were 25 cases in the first week after receiving the booster dose, declining to 5 in the second and none in the third week. CONCLUSION: VE of primary vaccination in residents of LTCF was very low against SARS-CoV-2 infection and moderate against mortality. There were few cases at 2 weeks after the booster dose and no deaths, despite the presence of susceptible residents. These data are consistent with the positive impact of the booster vaccination in curbing transmission. Timely booster vaccination in residents of LTCF is therefore important."	"1873-2518

SETTING AND PATIENTS: All patients were admitted to an ICU between January 2021 (after vaccination was available) and July 2022 with a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on a SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test in Alberta, Canada. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENT: The propensity-matched primary outcome of all-cause in-hospital mortality was compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, and vaccinated patients were stratified by booster dosing. Secondary outcomes were mechanical ventilation (MV) duration ICU length of stay (LOS). MAIN RESULTS: The study included 3,293 patients: 743 (22.6%) were fully vaccinated (54.6% with booster), 166 (5.0%) were partially vaccinated, and 2,384 (72.4%) were unvaccinated. Unvaccinated patients were more likely to require invasive MV (78.4% vs 68.2%), vasopressor use (71.1% vs 66.6%), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (2.1% vs 0.5%). In a propensity-matched analysis, in-hospital mortality was similar (31.8% vs 34.0%, adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.25; 95% CI, 0.97-1.61), but median duration MV (7.6 vs 4.7 d; p < 0.001) and ICU LOS (6.6 vs 5.2 d; p < 0.001) were longer in unvaccinated compared to fully vaccinated patients. Among vaccinated patients, greater than or equal to 1 booster had lower in-hospital mortality (25.5% vs 40.9%; adjusted OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.0.36-0.68) and duration of MV (3.8 vs 5.6 d; p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one in four patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 after widespread COVID-19 vaccine availability represented a vaccine-breakthrough case. Mortality risk remains substantial in vaccinated patients and similar between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients after the onset of critical illness. However, COVID-19 vaccination is associated with reduced ICU resource utilization and booster dosing may increase survivability from COVID-19-related critical illness."	"1530-0293

COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes; however, their effectiveness in people with obesity is incompletely understood. We studied the relationship among body mass index (BMI), hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19 among 3.6 million people in Scotland using the Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) surveillance platform. We found that vaccinated individuals with severe obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m(2)) were 76% more likely to experience hospitalization or death from COVID-19 (adjusted rate ratio of 1.76 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.60-1.94). We also conducted a prospective longitudinal study of a cohort of 28 individuals with severe obesity compared to 41 control individuals with normal BMI (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)). We found that 55% of individuals with severe obesity had unquantifiable titers of neutralizing antibody against authentic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus compared to 12% of individuals with normal BMI (P = 0.0003) 6 months after their second vaccine dose. Furthermore, we observed that, for individuals with severe obesity, at any given anti-spike and anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody level, neutralizing capacity was lower than that of individuals with a normal BMI. Neutralizing capacity was restored by a third dose of vaccine but again declined more rapidly in people with severe obesity. We demonstrate that waning of COVID-19 vaccine-induced humoral immunity is accelerated in individuals with severe obesity. As obesity is associated with increased hospitalization and mortality from breakthrough infections, our findings have implications for vaccine prioritization policies."	"1546-170x

We aimed to determine the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination at a referral hospital in Lambayeque, Peru. We conducted a retrospective cohort study from February to September 2021. We included hospitalized patients with COVID-19, whose data were stored in NotiWeb, a patient data system of the Peruvian Ministry of Health. We applied a propensity score-weighting method according to baseline characteristics of patients, and estimated hazard ratios (HR) using Cox regression models. Of 1553 participants, the average age was 55 years (SD: 16.8), 907 (58%) were male, and 592 (38%) deceased at 28-day follow-up. Before hospital admission, 74 (4.8%) had been immunized with at least one vaccine dose. Effectiveness against death in vaccinated patients was 50% at 90-day follow-up (weighted HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28-0.89). Our results support the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against death and provide information after early immunization in Peru."	"2076-393x

The main goal of this study was to describe the COVID-19 vaccination status in patients admitted to Romanian ICUs with a severe COVID-19 infection. The study describes the patients' characteristics according to their vaccination status and evaluates the association between vaccination status and ICU mortality. METHODS: This retrospective, observational, multicenter study included patients with confirmed vaccination status admitted to Romanian ICUs from January 2021 to March 2022. RESULTS: Two thousand, two hundred and twenty-two patients with confirmed vaccination status were included. Five point one three percent of patients were vaccinated with two vaccine doses and one point seventeen percent of patients were vaccinated with one vaccine dose. The vaccinated patients showed a higher rate of comorbidities but had similar clinical characteristics at ICU admission and lower mortality rates compared to non-vaccinated patients. Vaccinated status and higher Glasgow Coma Scale at ICU admission were independently associated with ICU survival. Ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, higher SOFA score at ICU admission and the need for mechanical ventilation in ICU were independently associated with ICU mortality. CONCLUSION: Lower rates of ICU admission were observed in fully vaccinated patients even in a country with low vaccination coverage. The ICU mortality was lower for fully vaccinated patients compared to non-vaccinated patients. The benefit of vaccination on ICU survival could be more important in patients with associated comorbidities."	"2077-0383

We sought to explore the association between ethnic background and the probability of testing, testing positive, hospitalisation, COVID-19 mortality and vaccination uptake. DESIGN: A multistate cohort analysis. Participants were followed between 8 April 2020 and 30 September 2021. SETTING: The UK Biobank, which stores medical data on around half a million people who were recruited between 2006 and 2010. PARTICIPANTS: 405 541 subjects were eligible for analysis, limited to UK Biobank participants living in England. 23 891 (6%) of participants were non-white. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The associations between ethnic background and testing, testing positive, hospitalisation and COVID-19 mortality were studied using multistate survival analyses. The association with single and double-dose vaccination was also modelled. Multistate models adjusted for age, sex and socioeconomic deprivation were fitted to estimate adjusted HRs (aHR) for each of the multistate transitions. RESULTS: 18 172 (4.5%) individuals tested positive, 3285 (0.8%) tested negative and then positive, 1490 (6.9% of those tested positive) were hospitalised, and 129 (0.6%) tested positive at the moment of hospital admission (ie, direct hospitalisation). Finally, 662 (17.4%) died after admission. Compared with white participants, Asian participants had an increased risk of negative to positive transition (aHR 1.24 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.52)), testing positive (95% CI 1.44 (1.33 to 1.55)) and direct hospitalisation (1.61 (95% CI 1.28 to 2.03)). Black participants had an increased risk of hospitalisation following a positive test (1.71 (95% CI 1.29 to 2.27)) and direct hospitalisation (1.90 (95% CI 1.51 to 2.39)). Although not the case for Asians (aHR 1.00 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.02)), black participants had a reduced vaccination probability (0.63 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.65)). In contrast, Chinese participants had a reduced risk of testing negative (aHR 0.64 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.73)), of testing positive (0.40 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.57)) and of vaccination (0.78 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.83)). CONCLUSIONS: We identified inequities in testing, vaccination and COVID-19 outcomes according to ethnicity in England. Compared with whites, Asian participants had increased risks of infection and admission, and black participants had almost double hospitalisation risk, and a 40% lower vaccine uptake."	"2044-6055

However, these studies obtained data during the early phase of the pandemic and did not adjust for potential confounders, including PCR-test numbers per population (PCR-tests). Currently-more than four months after declaration of the pandemic-the BCG-hypothesis needs reexamining. An ecological study was conducted by obtaining data of 61 factors in 173 countries, including BCG vaccine coverage (%), using morbidity and mortality as outcomes, obtained from open resources. 'Urban population (%)' and 'insufficient physical activity (%)' in each country was positively associated with morbidity, but not mortality, after adjustment for PCR-tests. On the other hand, recent BCG vaccine coverage (%) was negatively associated with mortality, but not morbidity, even with adjustment for percentage of the population ≥ 60 years of age, morbidity, PCR-tests and other factors. The results of this study generated a hypothesis that a national BCG vaccination program seems to be associated with reduced mortality of COVID-19, although this needs to be further examined and proved by randomized clinical trials."

We examined whether flu-vaccination is associated with severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, as measured by intensive care unit (ICU)-admission, ventilator-use, and mortality. Other outcome measures included hospital length of stay and total ICU days. Our findings showed that flu-vaccination was associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of an ICU admission especially among aged <65 and non-obese patients. Public health promotion of flu-vaccination may help mitigate the overwhelming demand for critical COVID-19 care pending the large-scale availability of COVID-19 vaccines."	"1527-3296

COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections have been reported worldwide. In Pakistan, there are limited data on COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections and their clinical course, especially in healthcare professionals (HCPs). Our study aims to investigate COVID-19 infections among vaccinated HCPs. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 425 healthcare professionals. Data collected from healthcare professionals included names, age, gender, number of vaccination doses, COVID-19 infection pre and post-vaccination, the severity of COVID-19 infection (if positive), and co-morbid conditions. Ethical board approval was taken. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: After complete vaccination, 17.27% acquired COVID-19 infection; 2.47% had COVID-19 infection both pre and post-vaccination. The mean age was 32.46 years (n=71) with a standard deviation of ±9.376. The male to female ratio was 1.53. COVID-19 PCR was positive in 95.77%. During the course of the disease, 4.2% were asymptomatic, 92.95% had mild symptoms, 1.4% were hospitalized, and 1.4% had to be managed in the intensive care unit. None of the HCPs who had received booster doses acquired a COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: It was found that prior COVID-19 infection and vaccination do not confer immunity from infection. However, proper vaccination limits the severity, morbidity, and mortality of COVID-19 infection."	"2168-8184

However, previous studies have been contradictory. We aimed to determine whether immunocompromised patients were at greater risk of in-hospital death and how this risk changed over the pandemic. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included patients > = 19 years with symptomatic community-acquired COVID-19 recruited to the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK prospective cohort study. We defined immunocompromise as immunosuppressant medication preadmission, cancer treatment, organ transplant, HIV, or congenital immunodeficiency. We used logistic regression to compare the risk of death in both groups, adjusting for age, sex, deprivation, ethnicity, vaccination, and comorbidities. We used Bayesian logistic regression to explore mortality over time. Between 17 January 2020 and 28 February 2022, we recruited 156,552 eligible patients, of whom 21,954 (14%) were immunocompromised. In total, 29% (n = 6,499) of immunocompromised and 21% (n = 28,608) of immunocompetent patients died in hospital. The odds of in-hospital mortality were elevated for immunocompromised patients (adjusted OR 1.44, 95% CI [1.39, 1.50], p < 0.001). Not all immunocompromising conditions had the same risk, for example, patients on active cancer treatment were less likely to have their care escalated to intensive care (adjusted OR 0.77, 95% CI [0.7, 0.85], p < 0.001) or ventilation (adjusted OR 0.65, 95% CI [0.56, 0.76], p < 0.001). However, cancer patients were more likely to die (adjusted OR 2.0, 95% CI [1.87, 2.15], p < 0.001). Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation, comorbidities, and vaccination status. As the pandemic progressed, in-hospital mortality reduced more slowly for immunocompromised patients than for immunocompetent patients. This was particularly evident with increasing age: the probability of the reduction in hospital mortality being less for immunocompromised patients aged 50 to 69 years was 88% for men and 83% for women, and for those >80 years was 99% for men and 98% for women. The study is limited by a lack of detailed drug data prior to admission, including steroid doses, meaning that we may have incorrectly categorised some immunocompromised patients as immunocompetent. CONCLUSIONS: Immunocompromised patients remain at elevated risk of death from COVID-19. Targeted measures such as additional vaccine doses, monoclonal antibodies, and nonpharmaceutical preventive interventions should be continually encouraged for this patient group.

We aimed to determine whether COVID-19 was associated with high rates of mortality independently of age, sex and underlying disorders. METHODS: A population-based, matched, case-control study of adults insured by Clalit Health Services was performed. Cases were defined as patients who died of all causes between July and December 2020. Each case was matched in a ratio of 1:1 with a living control based on age, sex and co-morbidities. An unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: A total of 2874 patients who died were successfully matched with 2874 living controls. The prevalence of COVID-19 was higher among the patients who died than among the controls (13.5% [387/2874] vs. 4% [115/2874], respectively; OR, 3.73; 95% CI, 3.01-4.63; p < 0.001). A significantly increased odds of mortality was also observed in patients with COVID-19 without underlying diseases (OR, 3.67; 95% CI, 2.58-5.23) and in patients with COVID-19 and underlying diseases (OR, 3.77; 95% CI, 2.87-4.94). A multi-variate logistic analysis showed that COVID-19 (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.07-3.77), low socio-economic status (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02-1.82), dementia (OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 2.10-3.01), smoking (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.13-1.63) and an interaction variable of age >80 years and COVID-19 (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.14-4.54) were independent risk factors for mortality, whereas influenza vaccination and high body mass index were associated with lower rates of mortality. CONCLUSION: Testing positive for COVID-19 increased the risk of death three folds, regardless of underlying disorders. These results emphasize the effect of COVID-19 on mortality during the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak, when no vaccines or effective therapeutics were available."	"1469-0691

However, hesitancy toward this vaccine is a global health issue for the general population The Vaccine acceptance rate among patients affected with inherited metabolic disorders (IMD), as well as safety profile, has not been described. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study, based on a telephone survey, investigating the COVID-19 vaccination rate, the incidence and type of adverse effects (AEs), the reasons for vaccine refusal and the effects on the underlying disease in a cohort of IMD patients followed at a single center and invited directly to vaccination by specialistic team. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were included in the study, the median age was 23.4 years (min 12.1-max 61.7), 47% (n = 85) were females and 61% (107) were affected from impaired metabolism of phenylalanine. By October 2021, 94% (n = 163) of them had received at least one dose of the vaccine, which was, in 98% of cases, mRNA-based vaccine, given at the referral hospital in 65% of cases. Overall, 72% of patients with IMD reported AE to the vaccine: 60% after the first dose, 81% after the second. The highest rate of adverse events at the first dose was reported in patients with amino acids related disorders other than impaired phenylalanine metabolism (PKU/HPA) (88%). For the second dose, the PKU/HPA group reported the highest rate of AEs (89% of cases). There was no effect on the underlying disease or acute decompensation after the vaccine. Eleven patients (6%) were not vaccinated because they considered it dangerous. CONCLUSION: Among individuals with IMD, the vaccination rate was high, the incidence and severity of AEs were comparable to those in the general population with no effects on the disease. Direct contact with the specialist medical team, has proven to reassure patients and effectively contrast hesitancy."	"1660-4601

Vaccination is a key preventative strategy but is associated with decreased humoral responses among SOTR. Whether dampened immune responses correlate with reduced clinical effectiveness is unclear. Our study was designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the early vaccine era. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study comparing SARS-CoV-2 infection rates between SOTRs who received two doses of mRNA or one dose of Ad26.Cov2.S vaccine and those not fully vaccinated (partially vaccinated and unvaccinated). To evaluate clinical effectiveness of vaccine, cause-specific Cox regression model and modified Poisson regression model were built using the propensity score-matched cohort. Additionally, the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 of fully vaccinated and not fully vaccinated SOTR were compared. RESULTS: Of 2705 SOTRs, 1668 were included in our final matched analysis, which showed a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 76% reduction of all-cause-mortality among fully vaccinated patients. Thirty-nine SOTRs developed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including nine fully vaccinated and 30 not fully vaccinated. Among fully vaccinated patients, 22% had severe/critical COVID-19 and 0% mortality versus not fully vaccinated SOTRs, of whom 37% had severe/critical COVID-19 and 6.67% COVID-19-related mortality. CONCLUSION: In SOTRs, completion of primary vaccine series in the early vaccine era was associated with a significant reduction of COVID-19 and was protective against severe/critical disease and death. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of current vaccine recommendations for SOTR against emerging new variants."	"1399-3062

Trials from areas with high incidence rates for infectious diseases indicated that the tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) induces in addition non-specific immunity against various pathogens and thereby reduces overall mortality more than would have been expected by just protecting from tuberculosis. Although recent trials produced conflicting results, it was suggested that BCG might protect from non-tuberculosis respiratory infections and could be used to bridge the time until a specific vaccine against novel respiratory diseases like COVID-19 is available. METHODS: We performed a systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2011 and December 9(th), 2022, providing evidence about non-specific effects after BCG vaccination, assessed their potential for bias, and meta-analyzed relevant clinical outcomes. We excluded RCTs investigating vaccination with an additional vaccine unless outcomes from a follow-up period before the second vaccination were reported. RESULTS: Our search identified 16 RCTs including 34,197 participants. Vaccination with BCG caused an estimated 44% decrease in risk for respiratory infections (hazard ratio (HR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-0.82) with substantial heterogeneity between trials (I(2) = 77%). There was evidence for a protective effect on all-cause mortality of 21% if follow-up was restricted to one year (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64-0.99). We did not find evidence for an effect when we considered longer follow-up (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75-1.03). Infection-related mortality after BCG vaccination was reduced by 33% (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.46-0.99), mortality for sepsis by 38% (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.93). There was no evidence for a protective effect of BCG vaccination on infections of any origin (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71-1.00), COVID-19 (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.68-1.14), sepsis (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55-1.10) or hospitalization (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: According to these results, depending on the setting, vaccination with BCG provides time-limited partial protection against non-tuberculosis respiratory infections and may reduce mortality. These findings underline BCG's potential (1) in pandemic preparedness against novel pathogens especially in developing countries with established BCG vaccination programs but limited access to specific vaccines; (2) in reducing microbial infections, antimicrobial prescriptions and thus the development of antimicrobial resistance. There is a need for additional RCTs to clarify the circumstances under which BCG's non-specific protective effects are mediated."	"2076-393x

METHODS: Bari-SolidAct is a phase-3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, enrolling participants from June 3, 2021 to March 7, 2022, stopped prematurely for external evidence. Patients with severe/critical COVID-19 were randomised to Baricitinib 4 mg once daily or placebo, added to standard of care. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 60 days. Participants were remotely followed to day 90 for safety and patient related outcome measures. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-nine patients were screened, 284 randomised, and 275 received study drug or placebo and were included in the modified intent-to-treat analyses (139 receiving baricitinib and 136 placebo). Median age was 60 (IQR 49-69) years, 77% were male and 35% had received at least one dose of SARS-CoV2 vaccine. There were 21 deaths at day 60 in each group, 15.1% in the baricitinib group and 15.4% in the placebo group (adjusted absolute difference and 95% CI - 0.1% [- 8·3 to 8·0]). In sensitivity analysis censoring observations after drug discontinuation or rescue therapy (tocilizumab/increased steroid dose), proportions of death were 5.8% versus 8.8% (- 3.2% [- 9.0 to 2.7]), respectively. There were 148 serious adverse events in 46 participants (33.1%) receiving baricitinib and 155 in 51 participants (37.5%) receiving placebo. In subgroup analyses, there was a potential interaction between vaccination status and treatment allocation on 60-day mortality. In a subsequent post hoc analysis there was a significant interaction between vaccination status and treatment allocation on the occurrence of serious adverse events, with more respiratory complications and severe infections in vaccinated participants treated with baricitinib. Vaccinated participants were on average 11 years older, with more comorbidities. CONCLUSION: This clinical trial was prematurely stopped for external evidence and therefore underpowered to conclude on a potential survival benefit of baricitinib in severe/critical COVID-19. We observed a possible safety signal in vaccinated participants, who were older with more comorbidities. Although based on a post-hoc analysis, these findings warrant further investigation in other trials and real-world studies. Trial registration Bari-SolidAct is registered at NCT04891133 (registered May 18, 2021) and EUClinicalTrials.eu ( 2022-500385-99-00 )."	"1466-609x

Vaccination"	"BACKGROUND: The roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines is a multi-faceted challenge whose performance depends on pace of vaccination, vaccine characteristics and heterogeneities in individual risks. METHODS: We developed a mathematical model accounting for the risk of severe disease by age and comorbidity, and transmission dynamics. We compared vaccine prioritisation strategies in the early roll-out stage and quantified the extent to which measures could be relaxed as a function of the vaccine coverage achieved in France. FINDINGS: Prioritizing at-risk individuals reduces morbi-mortality the most if vaccines only reduce severity, but is of less importance if vaccines also substantially reduce infectivity or susceptibility. Age is the most important factor to consider for prioritization; additionally accounting for comorbidities increases the performance of the campaign in a context of scarce resources. Vaccinating 90% of ≥65 y.o. and 70% of 18-64 y.o. before autumn 2021 with a vaccine that reduces severity by 90% and susceptibility by 80%, we find that control measures reducing transmission rates by 15-27% should be maintained to remain below 1000 daily hospital admissions in France with a highly transmissible variant (basic reproduction number R(0)  = 4). Assuming 90% of ≥65 y.o. are vaccinated, full relaxation of control measures might be achieved with a vaccine coverage of 89-100% in 18-64 y.o or 60-69% of 0-64 y.o. INTERPRETATION: Age and comorbidity-based vaccine prioritization strategies could reduce the burden of the disease. Very high vaccination coverage may be required to completely relax control measures. Vaccination of children, if possible, could lower coverage targets necessary to achieve this objective."

Vaccination"	"BACKGROUND: Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) associated with viral vector COVID-19 vaccines, including ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca AZD1222) vaccine, can result in significant morbidity and mortality. We report the clinicopathological features of TTS following ChAdOx1-S vaccination and summarise the case outcomes in Australia. METHODS: In this cohort study, patients diagnosed with TTS in Australia between 23 March and 31 December 2021 were identified according to predefined criteria. Cases were included if they met the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) probable and confirmed case definitions and were reclassified using Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition for analysis. Data were collected on patient baseline characteristics, clinicopathological features, risk factors, treatment and outcomes. FINDINGS: A total of 170 TTS cases were identified, with most occurring after the first dose (87%) of ChAdOx1-S. The median time to symptom onset after vaccination and symptom onset to admission was 11 and 2 days respectively. The median age of cases was 66 years (interquartile range 55-74). All except two patients received therapeutic anticoagulation and 66% received intravenous immunoglobulin. Overall, 85.3% of cases were discharged home after a median hospitalisation of 6 days, 9.4% required ongoing rehabilitation and 5.3% died. Eight deaths were related to TTS, with another dying from an unrelated condition while receiving treatment for TTS. Deaths occurred more commonly in those classified as Tier 1 according to the CDC definition and were associated with more severe thrombocytopenia and disease-related haemorrhage. INTERPRETATION: TTS, while rare, can be severe and have catastrophic outcomes in some individuals. In Australia, the mortality rate was low compared to that reported in other high-income countries. Almost all received therapeutic anticoagulation with no bleeding complications and were successfully discharged. This emphasises the importance of community education and an established pathway for early recognition, diagnosis and treatment of TTS.

Patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis are at a higher risk of infection and mortality than the general population. Worldwide, a vaccination campaign has been developed that has been shown to reduce severe infections and deaths in the general population. However, there are currently limited data on the clinical efficacy of vaccinations in the hemodialysis population. METHODS: A national multicenter observational cohort was performed in Chile to evaluate the clinical efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in end-stage renal disease patients on chronic hemodialysis from February 2021 to August 2021. In addition, the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and CoronaVac (Sinovac) vaccines were evaluated. The efficacy of vaccination in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalizations, and deaths associated with COVID-19 was determined. RESULTS: A total of 12,301 patients were evaluated; 10,615 (86.3%) received a complete vaccination (2 doses), 490 (4.0%) received incomplete vaccination, and 1196 (9.7%) were not vaccinated. During follow-up, 1362 (11.0%) patients developed COVID-19, and 150 died (case fatality rate: 11.0%). The efficacy of the complete vaccination in preventing infection was 18.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]:11.8-23.8%), and prevention of death was 66.0% (95% CI:60.6-70.7%). When comparing both vaccines, BNT162b2 and CoronaVac were effective in reducing infection and deaths associated with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the BNT162b2 vaccine had higher efficacy in preventing infection (42.6% vs. 15.0%) and deaths (90.4% vs. 64.8%) compared to CoronaVac. CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients on chronic hemodialysis was effective in preventing infection and death associated with COVID-19."

Background: Many previous studies have reported COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness, but there are few studies in Japan. This
community-based, retrospective observational study investigated the association between vaccination status and COVID-19-related
health outcomes in COVID-19 patients by SARS-CoV-2 variant type.
Methods: The study participants were 24,314 COVID-19 patients aged 12 or older whose diagnoses were reported to the Nara
Prefecture Chuwa Public Health Center from April 2021 to March 2022, during periods when the alpha, delta, and omicron variants of
COVID-19 were predominant. The outcome variables were severe health consequences (SHC) (i.e., ICU admission and COVID-19-
related death), hospitalization, and extension of recovery period. The explanatory variable was vaccination status at least 14 days prior
to infection. Covariates included gender, age, population size, the number of risk factors for aggravation, and the number of symptoms
at diagnosis. The generalized estimating equations of the multivariable Poisson regression models were used to estimate the adjusted
incidence proportion (AIP) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each health outcome. We performed stratified analyses by SARSCoV-2 variant type, but the association between vaccination status and COVID-19-related health outcomes was stratified only for the
delta and omicron variants due to the small number of vaccinated patients during the alpha variant.
Results: Of the 24,314 participants, 255 (1.0%) had SHC; of the 24,059 participants without SHC, 2,102 (8.7%) were hospitalized; and
of the 19,603 participants without SHC, hospitalization, and missing data on recovery period, 2,960 (15.1%) had extension of recovery
period. Multivariable Poisson regression models showed that regardless of SARS-CoV-2 variant type or health outcome, those who
received two or more vaccine doses had significantly lower risk of health outcomes than those who did not receive the vaccine, and
there was a dose-response relationship in which the AIP for health outcomes decreased with an increased number of vaccinations.
Conclusion: A higher number of vaccinations were associated with lower risk of COVID-19-related health outcomes, not only in the
delta variant but also in the omicron variant. Our findings suggest that increasing the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses can prevent
severe disease and lead to early recovery of patients not requiring hospitalization."	""	""	""	"internal-pdf://1492891041/ehpm-28-007.pdf"	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""

OBJECTIVE: To identify the observed incidence of anaphylaxis in recipients of different anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. METHODS: A nationwide observational study among recipients of 61,414,803 doses of seven different anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, describing the incidence and characteristics of adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) who developed anaphylaxis as an adverse event following immunization (AEFI) against SARS-CoV-2 vaccines between December 24, 2020, and October 15, 2021, in Mexico. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients developed anaphylaxis as an AEFI, for an overall observed incidence of 1.07 cases per 1,000,000 (95% CI 0.84-1.37) administered doses. Eighty-six percent of the patients were female, consistent with previous reports of AEFI to COVID-19 vaccines. mRNA-based vaccine recipients had the highest frequency of anaphylaxis, followed by adenovirus-vectored vaccines and inactivated virus recipients, with an observed incidence of 2.5, 0.7, and 0.2 cases per 1,000,000 doses administered, respectively. Only 46% of the patients received correct treatment with epinephrine as the first-line treatment through the appropriate route and dose. We detected one case of anaphylactic reaction-related death occurring 5 min following immunization with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 for a mortality rate of 1.5% among those who developed this AEFI. CONCLUSIONS: In our population, anaphylactic reactions were infrequent. Our study provides further evidence supporting the security of these newly developed vaccines."	"1573-2592

It is a matter of curiosity how many of the patients who come to the emergency department (ED) are vaccinated. We aimed to examine the characteristics of ED patients needing hospitalizations related to moderate and severe COVID-19 by vaccination status. METHODS: A retrospective study of 559 rRT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection cases with moderate or severe COVID-19 needing hospitalization was performed in August 2021. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed for factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 60.8 ± 18.1 years old, and 54.2% (n = 303) of the patients were women. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (37.2%), diabetes mellitus (31.1%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (13.8%), respectively. The number of patients with alpha variant was 399 (71.4%), and delta variant was 83 (14.8%). Fifty point 6% (n = 283) of the patients were fully vaccinated. The total number of patients who died in the study was 114 (20.4%), and the number of patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit was 168 (30.1%). The day between the last dose of vaccine and hospitalization was 117 ± 45.9 days. In multivariate logistic regression analysis: age (odds ratio (OR), 1.05; 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 1.03-1.08- year increase), male gender (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.9), presence of at least one comorbid disease (OR, 2; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7) and partial (OR, 0.24;95% CI, 0.09-0.6) and fully vaccinated status (OR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.05-0.18) were associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, age older than 65, unvaccinated, and comorbidities had significantly higher mortality. In multivariate regression analyses, age, vaccination status, comorbidities and the male gender were associated with mortality. Our study did not evaluate the vaccine efficacy but, a lower mortality rate was observed in those fully vaccinated with CoronaVac and Pfizer-BioNTech. Additionally, Alpha, Delta and other variants had the same mortality rates."	"1532-8171

The focus of the analysis is on the endemic phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The paper provides an overview of Finland's healthcare system, trends in COVID-19 morbidity, mortality and vaccination coverage data, political considerations, interventions to control the pandemic, as well as the economic impact of the pandemic in the endemic phase. Data were collected from various sources, including previous studies, government reports, national statistics and registers and general media. Results In Finland, the total number of COVID-19 infections increased significantly during 2022, but the number of serious forms of the disease decreased. The implementation of the vaccination strategy caused a diversity of opinions among authorities and experts. The governing of the pandemic was fully decentralized. Overall, there is a good vaccination coverage of the population. In the endemic phase society returned to live without restrictions. Conclusions It seems clear that vaccines played an important role in controlling the pandemic. Overall mortality increased substantially in 2022 causing life expectancy to fall. Moreover, different “excess death” indicators show an increase in 2021 and 2022, but the timing and magnitude of the effect varies. It is relatively safe to conclude that at least part of increase can be attributed to the pandemic, but a more exact conclusion calls for a comprehensive study. Similarly, understanding long covid and designing required intervention calls for more research."

SARS-CoV-2"	"OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of corona virus-induced disease 19 (COVID-19) that was declared as a global pandemic in March 2020 by the world health organization (WHO). Two vaccines were granted for emergency use by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) in India, Covishield® (AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin® (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited). Sputnik - V has been granted EUA in the month of April 2021. The purpose of this study is to determine the association of COVID-19 infection, its severity and outcome in COVID-19 vaccinated people. METHODS: This was a hospital based prospective cohort study done between March to June 2021 at PBM Associated Group of Hospitals (AGH), Bikaner, Raj. Total 1028 COVID suspected cases consulted in COVID OPD or hospitalized under department of medicine, out of which 146 satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, out of these 146, first 100 cases who gave consent for part of study were selected. RESULTS: Among 100 COVID-19 infected cases, 49 received first dose while rest got both doses. After first dose of vaccination 42.86% had mild and 32.65% had severe clinical infection while after both doses 80.39% had mild and 11.76% had severe clinical infection. On evaluation of HRCT Chest, after first dose 8.16% had normal 40.82% were in severe category while those who got both doses it was 52.82% 3.92% respectively. Among 49 who got first dose, 10.20% recovered on just home based treatment without any need of hospitalization, while 89.8% got admitted in dedicated COVID hospital out of which 73.47% got recovered and 16.33% died. Among 51 who got both the doses, 66.67% recovered on just home based treatment, while 33.33% required hospitalization out of which 25.49% got recovered and 7.84% died. CONCLUSION: After 2nd dose of vaccine there is a significant risk reduction in need of hospitalization and getting severe infection and mortality when compared with first dose only."	"Thathai, Aman

AIM: To assess the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine in preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization and death in individuals with or without iron deficiency. METHODS: This large retrospective, longitudinal cohort study analyzed real-world data from the Maccabi Healthcare Services database (covering 25% of Israeli residents). Eligible adults (aged ≥16 years) received a first BNT162b2 vaccine dose between December 19, 2020, and February 28, 2021, followed by a second dose as per approved vaccine label. Individuals were excluded if they had SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccination, had hemoglobinopathy, received a cancer diagnosis since January 2020, had been treated with immunosuppressants, or were pregnant at the time of vaccination. Vaccine effectiveness was assessed in terms of incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, relative risks of COVID-19-related hospitalization, and mortality in individuals with iron deficiency (ferritin <30 ng/mL or transferrin saturation <20%). The two-dose protection period was Days 7 to 28 after the second vaccination. RESULTS: Data from 184,171 individuals with (mean [standard deviation; SD] age 46.2 [19.6] years; 81.2% female) versus 1,072,019 without (mean [SD] age 46.9 [18.0] years; 46.2% female) known iron deficiency were analyzed. Vaccine effectiveness in the two-dose protection period was 91.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 83.7-96.0%) and 92.1% (95% CI 84.2-96.1%) for those with versus without iron deficiency (P = 0.96). Of patients with versus without iron deficiency, hospitalizations occurred in 28 and 19 per 100,000 during the reference period (Days 1-7 after the first dose), and in 19 and 7 per 100,000 during the two-dose protection period, respectively. Mortality rates were comparable between study groups: 2.2 per 100,000 (4/181,012) in the population with iron deficiency and 1.8 per 100,000 (19/1,055,298) in those without known iron deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine is >90% effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the 3 weeks after the second vaccination, irrespective of iron-deficiency status. These findings support the use of the vaccine in populations with iron deficiency."	"1932-6203

This study aims to estimate effectiveness of influenza vaccination, using Abbott's quadrivalent Influvac Tetra vaccine, against SARS-CoV-2 infection and against severe COVID-19. METHODS: This matched, test-negative, case-control study was implemented on a population of 30,774 healthcare workers (HCWs) in Qatar during the 2020 annual influenza vaccination campaign, September 17, 2020-December 31, 2020, before introduction of COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Of 30,774 HCWs, 576 with PCR-positive tests and 10,033 with exclusively PCR-negative tests were eligible for inclusion in the study. Matching by sex, age, nationality, reason for PCR testing, and PCR test date yielded 518 cases matched to 2058 controls. Median duration between influenza vaccination and the PCR test was 43 days (IQR, 29-62). Estimated effectiveness of influenza vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection> 14 days after receiving the vaccine was 29.7% (95% CI: 5.5-47.7%). Estimated effectiveness of influenza vaccination against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 88.9% (95% CI: 4.1-98.7%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the main analysis results. CONCLUSIONS: Recent influenza vaccination is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity."	"1876-035x

However, limited safety data are available for inactivated (CoronaVac) and mRNA (BNT162b2) vaccines during pregnancy regarding their effect on birth outcomes and neonatal mortality, especially in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with 17 513 singleton live births conceived between 15 May 2021 and 23 October 2021. The primary exposure was maternal vaccination with CoronaVac or mRNA BNT162b2 vaccines and sub-analyses were performed by the gestational trimester of the first dose and the number of doses given during pregnancy. The outcomes were pre-term birth (PTB), small for gestational age (SGA), low birthweight (LBW), low Apgar 5 and neonatal death. We used the Cox model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% CI and applied the inverse probability of treatment weights to generate adjusted HRs. RESULTS: We found no significant increase in the risk of PTB (HR: 0.98; 95% CI 0.88, 1.10), SGA (HR: 1.09; 95% CI 0.96, 1.27), LBW (HR: 1.00; 95% CI 0.88, 1.14), low Apgar 5 (HR: 0.81; 95% CI 0.55, 1.22) or neonatal death (HR: 0.88; 95% CI 0.56, 1.48) in women vaccinated with CoronaVac or BNT162b2 vaccines. These findings were consistent across sub-analyses stratified by the gestational trimester of the first dose and the number of doses given during pregnancy. We found mild yet consistent protection against PTB in women who received different vaccine platforms during the third trimester of pregnancy (any vaccines, HR: 0.78; 95% CI 0.63, 0.98; BNT162b2, HR: 0.75; 95% CI 0.59, 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that COVID-19 vaccination in all trimesters of pregnancy, irrespective of the vaccine type, is safe and does not increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes or neonatal deaths."

Temporal changes of hospitalized patient characteristics should continue to be analyzed as COVID-19 progresses. OBJECTIVES: Compare the demographics and outcomes of hospitalized patients during New York City's third wave of COVID-19 to the first two waves. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study across five hospitals within Mount Sinai Health System, a quaternary academic medical system in New York City. Participants were adult inpatients admitted with COVID-19 identified by positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction at admission or clinical documentation of infection during the three waves of COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient demographics, comorbidities, vaccination status, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Mount Sinai Health System were examined. Patients admitted during the third wave were notably younger than the first two, were mostly unvaccinated against COVID-19, and there was a higher rate of patients who self-report as Black or African American as compared with the first two waves. The rate of patients requiring ICU level of care remained consistent throughout all three periods; however, the rate of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation decreased and inhospital mortality has trended down. Unvaccinated patients in the third wave are significantly younger with lower comorbidity burden than fully vaccinated patients. RESULTS: A total of 13,036 patients were included between the 3 waves. In the 3rd wave patients were notably younger, with a lower intubation rate and lower inhospital death rate. In the 3rd wave, 400 (62.9%) were unvaccinated, 236 (37.1%) were fully vaccinated, and 34 (4.8%) were partially vaccinated. Unvaccinated patients had similar rates of intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation compared with vaccinated patients, though inhospital mortality was lower in unvaccinated patients compared with vaccinated patients which may be expected given their lower age and burden of comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We continue to see improved outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients that are unvaccinated against COVID-19 are younger and have less reported comorbidities."

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus continues to mutate, and the availability of vaccines and boosters continue to rise, it is important to understand the health care burden of new variants. We analyze patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in a large Academic Health System during New York City's fourth surge beginning on November 27, 2021. METHODS: All patients admitted to an ICU were included in the primary analysis. Key demographics and outcomes were retrospectively compared between patients stratified by vaccination status. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality for all admitted patients during the fourth wave was significantly lower than in previous waves. However, among patients requiring intensive care, in-hospital mortality was high across all levels of vaccination status. In a multivariate model older age was associated with increased in-hospital mortality, vaccination status of overdue for booster was associated with decreased in hospital mortality, and vaccination status of up-to-date with vaccination showed a trend to reduced mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital mortality of patients with severe respiratory failure from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains high despite decreasing overall mortality. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was protective against mortality. Vaccination remains the best and safest way to protect against serious illness and death from COVID-19. It remains unclear that any other treatment will have success in changing the natural history of the disease."	"2586-6060

METHODS: We estimated the number of hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths directly averted by vaccination in France, in people aged ≥ 50 years, from December 2020 to March 2022, based on (1) the number of observed events, (2) vaccination coverage, and (3) vaccine effectiveness. We accounted for the effect of primary vaccination and the first booster dose, the circulating variants, the age groups, and the waning of vaccine-induced protection over time. RESULTS: An estimated 480,150 (95% CI: 260,072-582,516) hospitalizations, 132,156 (50,409-157,767) ICU admissions and 125,376 (53,792-152,037) deaths were directly averted by vaccination in people aged ≥ 50 years, which corresponds to a reduction of 63.2% (48.2-67.6), 68.7% (45.6-72.4) and 62.7% (41.9-67.1) respectively, compared to what would have been expected without vaccination over the study period. An estimated 5852 (2285-6853) deaths were directly averted among the 50-59 years old, 16,837 (6568-19,473) among the 60-69 years old, 32,136 (13,651-36,758) among the 70-79 years old and 70,551 (31,288-88,953) among the ≥ 80 years old. CONCLUSIONS: The vaccination campaign in France considerably reduced COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, as well as stress on the healthcare system."	"1741-7015

There is scarce data about the clinical and epidemiological characteristic analyses of the third wave. We present the data of COVID-19 patients from Mumbai region during the early third wave by taking S-gene target failure (SGTF) as a proxy for probable Omicron cases. METHODS: We collected retrospective data of RT-PCR-confirmed (COVID-19) patients, and measured the proportion of possible Omicron cases by SGTF. We segregated and analyzed the clinical and lab data of patients with outcomes such as differing symptoms, vaccination coverage, previous infection, and travel history. We also performed a trend analysis of Mumbai's COVID-19 data before and during the third wave. RESULTS: All patients had mild clinical symptoms while few were asymptomatic. Myalgia was more significantly present in SGTF/Omicron cases compared to non-SGTF/Delta patients. Out of the total 101 COVID-positive individuals, 94 individuals (93%) had taken two doses of COVID vaccine. Among these 94 individuals, 9 (8.9%) had been previously infected with COVID 19 in the first or second waves. 77.7% of the previously infected were now infected with Omicron variant and only 22.3% by a non-Omicron variant. CONCLUSION: Rapid rise and fall during the third wave in Mumbai was due to Omicron cases gradually replacing Delta. The overall milder clinical spectrum in both Omicron and Delta cases imply that vaccines might not be effective against re-infection but can attenuate disease severity and mortality, as evident by high coverage of vaccination in the country."

OBJECTIVES: To examine the risk of serious adverse effects after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) in cohort studies and self-controlled case series (SCCS). METHODS: Using an administrative claims database linked with the COVID-19 vaccination registry in a city in Japan between September 2020 and September 2021, we identified health insurance enrolees aged ≥ 18 years. We evaluated the risk of acute myocardial infarction, appendicitis, Bell's palsy, convulsions/seizures, disseminated intravascular coagulation, immune thrombocytopenia, pulmonary embolism, haemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism, and all-cause mortality, 21 days following any COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, compared with non-vaccination periods. For the cohort studies, we estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) by Poisson regression and rate differences (IRDs) by weighted least-squares regression, adjusting for sex, age, and Charlson comorbidity index. We applied a modified SCCS design to appropriately treat outcome-dependent exposures. For the modified SCCS, we estimated within-subject IRRs by weighted conditional Poisson regression. Subgroup analyses stratified by sex and age were also conducted. RESULTS: We identified 184,491 enrolees [male: 87,218; mean (standard deviation) age: 64.2 (19.5) years] with 136,667 first and 127,322 s dose vaccinations. The risks of any outcomes did not increase in any analyses, except for the fact that the modified SCCS indicated an increased risk of pulmonary embolism after the first dose in women (within-subject IRR [95%CI]: 3.97 [1.18-13.32]). CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was generally safe, whilst a signal of pulmonary embolism following the first dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was observed."

Current data on vaccine effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines are limited to CKD patients on dialysis and seroconversion in the non-dialysis population. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted of adults with CKD using data extracted from the electronic health record database in Hong Kong. Adults with CKD and COVID-19 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction were included in the study. Each case was matched with up to 10 controls attending Hospital Authority services without a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on age, gender, and index date (within 3 calendar days). The vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac in preventing COVID-19 infection, hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality was estimated using conditional logistic regression adjusted by patients' comorbidities and medication history during the outbreak from January to March 2022. RESULTS: A total of 20,570 COVID-19 cases, 6,604 COVID-19-related hospitalizations, and 2,267 all-cause mortality were matched to 81,092, 62,803, and 21,348 controls, respectively. Compared to the unvaccinated group, three doses of BNT162b2 or CoronaVac were associated with a reduced risk of infection [BNT162b2: 64% (95% CI: 60 - 67), CoronaVac: 42% (95% CI: 38 - 47)], hospitalization [BNT162b2: 82 % (95% CI: 77 - 85), CoronaVac: 80% (95% CI: 76 - 84)], and mortality [BNT162b2: 94% (95% CI: 88 - 97), CoronaVac: 93% (95% CI: 88 - 96)]. Vaccines were less effective in preventing infection and hospitalization in the eGFR<15mL/min/1.73m2 and 15-29mL/min/1.73m2 subgroups as compared with higher GFR subgroups. However, receipt of vaccine, even for 1 dose, was effective in preventing all-cause mortality, with estimates similar to the higher eGFR subgroups, as compared to unvaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: A dose-response relationship was observed between the number of BNT162b2 or CoronaVac doses and the effectiveness against COVID-19 infection and related comorbidity in the CKD population."

METHODS: This study was conducted using COVID-19 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Case Surveillance Public Data Taskforce for 57 states, and United States territories between January 1, 2020 and March 20, 2022. Multivariable binary Hyperbolastic regression of type I was used to analyzes the data. RESULTS: Seniors and ICU-admitted patients had the highest risk of death. For each additional percent increase in fully vaccinated individuals, the odds of death deceased by 1%. The odds of death prior to vaccine availability, compared to post vaccine availability, was 1.27. When comparing the time periods each variant was dominant, the odds of death was 3.45-fold higher during Delta compared to Alpha. All predictor variables had P-values ≤.001. CONCLUSION: There was a noticeable difference in the odds of death among subcategories of age, race/ethnicity, sex, PMCs, hospitalization, ICU, vaccine availability, variant, and percent of fully vaccinated individuals."

That study included more than 8 million 18-100-year-old individuals from the beginning of the pandemic. Immunocompromised (IC) individuals have increased risk for COVID-19 and disease course might be more severe in them. In this study, we wished to estimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related death in IC individuals compared to healthy ones and the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine by reassessing HUN-VE 3 data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among the 8,087,988 individuals undergoing follow-up from the onset of the pandemic in the HUN-VE 3 cohort, we selected all the 263,116 patients with a diagnosis corresponding with IC and 6,128,518 controls from the second wave, before vaccinations started. The IC state was defined as two occurrences of corresponding ICD-10 codes in outpatient or inpatient claims data since 1 January, 2013. The control group included patients without chronic diseases. The data about vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related death were obtained from the National Public Health Center (NPHC) during the Delta wave. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported on a daily basis using a centralized system via the National Public Health Center (NPHC). RESULTS: Out of the 263,116 IC patients 12,055 patients (4.58%) and out of the 6,128,518 healthy controls 202,163 (3.30%) acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection. Altogether 436 IC patients and 2141 healthy controls died in relation to COVID-19. The crude incidence rate ratio (IRR) of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.40 (95%CI: 1.37-1.42) comparing IC patients to healthy controls. The crude mortality rate ratio was 4.75 (95%CI: 4.28-5.27). With respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection, interestingly, the BNT162b2 vaccine was more effective in IC patients compared to controls. Primary vaccine effectiveness (VE) was higher in IC patients compared to controls and the booster restored VE after waning. VE regarding COVID-19 related death was less in IC patients compared to healthy individuals. Booster vaccination increased VE against COVID-19-related death in both IC patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: There is increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related mortality in IC patient. Moreover, booster vaccination using BNT162b2 might restore impaired VE in these individuals."

For Victoria, Australia (6.6 million people), we evaluated 104 policy packages (two levels of stringency of public health and social measures [PHSMs], by two levels each of mask-wearing and respirator provision during large outbreaks, by 13 vaccination schedules) for nine future SARS-CoV-2 variant scenarios. METHODS: We used an agent-based model to estimate morbidity, mortality, and costs over 12 months from October 2022 for each scenario. The 104 policies (each averaged over the nine future variant scenarios) were ranked based on four evenly weighted criteria: cost-effectiveness from (a) health system only and (b) health system plus GDP perspectives, (c) deaths and (d) days exceeding hospital occupancy thresholds. FINDINGS: More compared to less stringent PHSMs reduced cumulative infections, hospitalisations and deaths but also increased time in stage ≥3 PHSMs. Any further vaccination from October 2022 decreased hospitalisations and deaths by 12% and 27% respectively compared to no further vaccination and was usually a cost-saving intervention from a health expenditure plus GDP perspective. High versus low vaccine coverage decreased deaths by 15% and reduced time in stage ≥3 PHSMs by 20%. The modelled mask policies had modest impacts on morbidity, mortality, and health system pressure. The highest-ranking policy combination was more stringent PHSMs, two further vaccine doses (an Omicron-targeted vaccine followed by a multivalent vaccine) for ≥30-year-olds with high uptake, and promotion of increased mask wearing (but not Government provision of respirators). INTERPRETATION: Ongoing vaccination and PHSMs continue to be key components of the COVID-19 pandemic response. Integrated epidemiologic and economic modelling, as exemplified in this paper, can be rapidly updated and used in pandemic decision making.

In the present study, the sex ratios of reported deaths were compared by period. METHODS: Descriptive analysis was conducted using data on deaths reported after vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. The data used were published by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan. The risk period was defined as within 10 days of vaccination, and the control period was defined as 11 to 180 days after vaccination. Sex ratios were calculated for all-cause deaths and each outcome by dividing the number of males by that of females and multiplying by 100. Fisher's exact test was performed to analyze the results. Graphs were created to show the number of days from vaccination to death and that of reported deaths. RESULTS: For all-cause deaths among individuals aged ≥65 years, the sex ratio during the risk period was 92, significantly lower than that during the control period (130) (p=0.0050). Conversely, for all-cause deaths among those aged ≤64 years, the sex ratio during the risk period was 204, significantly higher than that during the control period (111) (p=0.044). Reported deaths were concentrated during the risk period in both groups. Sex ratios by period for each outcome were also examined. However, the differences were not significant across any of the outcomes. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination may influence the occurrence of death during the risk period. In a cohort study in Japan, there was no significant increase in all-cause mortality owing to vaccination. This does not contradict the results of the present study. The results of a cohort study provide support for vaccine safety. However, this does not indicate that vaccine-related deaths are nonexistent; it only indicates that their number is not large enough to make a significant difference. Japan has relief services for adverse health effects that provide financial support to patients. On this occasion, it is difficult to determine whether a postvaccination death is incidental or vaccine-related. A self-controlled risk interval design and a comparison of sex ratios by period may be useful in examining the association between vaccination and deaths after vaccination when a cohort study does not detect a significant difference due to a low mortality rate. The latter approach may be particularly useful for analyzing data with reporting bias. The author believes that this approach may not provide conclusive evidence, but it can offer valuable insights into assessing vaccine safety."	"2168-8184

Vaccine effectiveness"	"BACKGROUND: To date, few studies from the Asian region have reported the effectiveness of messenger ribonucleic acid coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines against disease progression and death after hospitalization. METHODS: We evaluated the data from the COVID-19 registry in Japan during the delta- and omicron-dominant phases. A propensity score-matched cohort study was conducted between the incompletely (0-1 dose) and fully (2 doses) vaccinated groups during the delta-dominant phase and among the incompletely, fully, and booster (3 doses) vaccinated groups during the omicron-dominant phase. RESULTS: In the delta-dominant phase, 411 pairs were matched. The fully vaccinated group showed a significantly lower oxygen supplementation rate (24.1 % vs. 41.1 %, p < 0.001) but little difference in the mortality rate (2.2 % vs. 2.9 %, p = 0.66). In the omicron-dominant phase, 1494 pairs from the incompletely and fully vaccinated groups, and 425 pairs from the fully and booster vaccinated groups were matched. Full vaccination reduced both the oxygen supplementation rate (18.6 % vs 25.7 %, p < 0.001) and mortality rate (0.7 % vs 2.3 %, p < 0.001). Booster vaccination showed little difference in either the rate of oxygen supplementation (21.2 % vs. 24.7 %, p = 0.25) or mortality (1.2 % vs. 2.6 %, p = 0.21) compared with full vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Full vaccination reduced disease severity during the delta- and omicron-dominant phases; booster vaccination did not further enhance the protective effects against disease progression during the omicron-dominant phase compared to full vaccination. Future vaccine strategies and policy decisions should consider preventing infection or disease progression in the target population, as well as the characteristics of the dominant variant in that phase."

In Thailand, the first and most available vaccines were inactivated and viral vector vaccines. We reported the impact of those vaccines in preventing severe disease and death in kidney transplant recipients. This retrospective study comprised 45 kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection, classified by vaccination status. Outcomes of interest were death, pneumonia, and allograft dysfunction. There were 23 patients in vaccinated group and 22 patients in unvaccinated group. All baseline characteristics were similar except mean age was older in vaccinated group, 55 vs. 48 years. Total 11 patients (24%) died (13% vaccinated vs. 36% unvaccinated RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.29-0.83; p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis showed that vaccination significantly decrease mortality (odds ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.10-0.94; p = 0.03). Pneumonia developed equally in both groups (70%). There was a trend toward less oxygen requirement as well as ventilator requirement in vaccinated group. The rate of allograft dysfunction was similar (47%). Inactivated and viral vector COVID-19 vaccines have beneficial effect on mortality reduction in kidney transplant recipients. Even partial vaccination can exert some protection against death. However, full vaccination should be encouraged to achieve better prevention."	"2076-393x

The specific inequities and other factors within megacities that affect vulnerability to COVID-19 mortality remain poorly defined. We assessed individual, community-level and healthcare factors associated with COVID-19-related mortality in a megacity of Jakarta, Indonesia, during two epidemic waves spanning 2 March 2020 to 31 August 2021. METHODS: This retrospective cohort included residents of Jakarta, Indonesia, with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. We extracted demographic, clinical, outcome (recovered or died), vaccine coverage data and disease prevalence from Jakarta Health Office surveillance records, and collected subdistrict level sociodemographics data from various official sources. We used multilevel logistic regression to examine individual, community and subdistrict-level healthcare factors and their associations with COVID-19 mortality. RESULTS: Of 705 503 cases with a definitive outcome by 31 August 2021, 694 706 (98.5%) recovered and 10 797 (1.5%) died. The median age was 36 years (IQR 24-50), 13.2% (93 459) were <18 years and 51.6% were female. The subdistrict level accounted for 1.5% of variance in mortality (p<0.0001). Mortality ranged from 0.9 to 1.8% by subdistrict. Individual-level factors associated with death were older age, male sex, comorbidities and age <5 years during the first wave (adjusted OR (aOR)) 1.56, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.35; reference: age 20-29 years). Community-level factors associated with death were poverty (aOR for the poorer quarter 1.35, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.55; reference: wealthiest quarter) and high population density (aOR for the highest density 1.34, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.58; reference: the lowest). Healthcare factor associated with death was low vaccine coverage (aOR for the lowest coverage 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.38; reference: the highest). CONCLUSION: In addition to individual risk factors, living in areas with high poverty and density, and low healthcare performance further increase the vulnerability of communities to COVID-19-associated death in urban low-resource settings."

Vaccination"	"BACKGROUND: In the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination has been effective in preventing COVID-19 infections and related mortality. The SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was also recommended by the international society for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, IBD patients were not recruited in prospective randomized clinical vaccine studies. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in IBD patients, we conducted this systemic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane Library for studies published between January 1, 2019, and September 9, 2021. Studies written in English reported the efficacy, seroconversion (anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike (S) antibody titer beyond the threshold) rate, and adverse events after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in IBD patients. We extracted the author, date, study design, country, types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, number of IBD patients receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, and study outcomes. Published data from the enrolled studies were pooled to determine effect estimates. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021264993). RESULTS: We analyzed findings from 27 454 IBD patients who received SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations in 11 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The post-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination COVID-19 infection rate was comparable between the IBD patients and non-IBD patients (odds ratio [OR], 1.28 [95% CI, 0.96-1.71]) and higher in nonvaccinated IBD patients compared with vaccinated IBD patients (OR, 8.63 [95% CI, 5.44-13.37]). The adverse event rate, severe adverse events, and mortality after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were 69%, 3%, and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is effective and tolerated in preventing COVID-19 infections in IBD patients. Over 98% of patients had seroconversion after receiving all doses of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and the influence of biologics on vaccination was limited. The SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is recommended for IBD patients."	"1728-7731

Cities/epidemiology"	"While extensive literature exists on the COVID-19 pandemic at regional and national levels, understanding its dynamics and consequences at the city level remains limited. This study investigates the pandemic in Maringá, a medium-sized city in Brazil's South Region, using data obtained by actively monitoring the disease from March 2020 to June 2022. Despite prompt and robust interventions, COVID-19 cases increased exponentially during the early spread of COVID-19, with a reproduction number lower than that observed during the initial outbreak in Wuhan. Our research demonstrates the remarkable impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on both mobility and pandemic indicators, particularly during the onset and the most severe phases of the emergency. However, our results suggest that the city's measures were primarily reactive rather than proactive. Maringá faced six waves of cases, with the third and fourth waves being the deadliest, responsible for over two-thirds of all deaths and overwhelming the local healthcare system. Excess mortality during this period exceeded deaths attributed to COVID-19, indicating that the burdened healthcare system may have contributed to increased mortality from other causes. By the end of the fourth wave, nearly three-quarters of the city's population had received two vaccine doses, significantly decreasing deaths despite the surge caused by the Omicron variant. Finally, we compare these findings with the national context and other similarly sized cities, highlighting substantial heterogeneities in the spread and impact of the disease."	"2045-2322

We aim to characterize breakthrough infections and identify risk factors associated with outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective case series of consecutive fully vaccinated patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a multicenter academic center in Southeast Michigan, between December 30, 2020, and September 15, 2021. RESULTS: A total of 982 patients were identified; the mean age was 57.9 years, 565 (59%) were female, 774 (79%) were White, and 255 (26%) were health care workers (HCWs). The median number of comorbidities was 2; 225 (23%) were immunocompromised. BNT162b2 was administered to 737 (75%) individuals. The mean time to SARS-CoV-2 detection was 135 days. The majority were asymptomatic or exhibited mild to moderate disease, 154 (16%) required hospitalization, 127 (13%) had severe-critical illness, and 19 (2%) died. Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.07; P < .001), cardiovascular disease (OR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.55-5.89; P = .001), and immunocompromised status (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.70-3.90; P < .001) were independent risk factors for hospitalization. Additionally, age (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.11; P = .006) was significantly associated with mortality. HCWs (OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05-0.50; P = .002) were less likely to be hospitalized, and prior receipt of BNT162b2 was associated with lower odds of hospitalization (OR, 0.436; 95% CI, 0.303-0.626; P < .001) and/or death (OR, 0.360; 95% CI, 0.145-0.898; P = .029). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccines remain effective at attenuating disease severity. However, patients with breakthrough infections necessitating hospitalization may benefit from early treatment modalities and COVID-19-mitigating strategies, especially in areas with substantial or high transmission rates."

solid organ transplant"	"Solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) are at high risk for infections including SARS-CoV-2, primarily due to use of immunosuppressive therapies that prevent organ rejection. Furthermore, these immunosuppressants are typically associated with suboptimal responses to vaccination. While COVID-19 vaccines have reduced the risk of COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality in SOTRs, breakthrough infection rates and death remain higher in this population compared with immunocompetent individuals. Approaches to enhancing response in SOTRs, such as through administration of additional doses and heterologous vaccination, have resulted in increased seroresponse and antibody levels. In this article, safety and immunogenicity of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in SOTRs are explored by dose. Key considerations for clinical practice and the current vaccine recommendations for SOTRs are discussed within the context of the dynamic COVID-19 vaccination guideline landscape. A thorough understanding of these topics is essential for determining public health and vaccination strategies to help protect immunocompromised populations, including SOTRs."	"1537-6613

In this retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 during the Delta (October-November 2021) and Omicron (January-April 2022) variant predominant periods in Slovenia, we assessed the association between primary vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and progression to critically severe disease (mechanical ventilation or death). Compared with the 529 patients hospitalized for acute COVID-19 during the Delta period (median age 65 years; 58.4% men), the 407 patients hospitalized during the Omicron period (median age 75 years; 50.6% men) were older, more often resided in long-term care facilities, and had higher Charlson comorbidity index scores. After adjusting for age, sex, the Charlson comorbidity index, the presence of immunocompromising conditions, and vaccination status, the patients admitted during the Omicron period had comparable odds of progressing to critically severe disease to those admitted during the Delta period. The 334/936 (35.7%) patients completing at least primary vaccination had lower odds of progression to critically severe disease and shorter hospital stay than unvaccinated patients; however, the protective effect of vaccination was less pronounced during the Omicron than during the Delta period. Although the Omicron variant appeared to better evade immunity induced by monovalent vaccines than the Delta variant, vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 remained an effective intervention to decrease morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients infected with the Omicron variant."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between primary vaccination with four SARS-CoV-2 vaccines authorized for use in the European Union-BNT162b2, ChAdOx-1S, mRNA-1273 or Ad.26.COV2.S-and progression to critically severe disease (mechanical ventilation or death) and duration of hospitalization among adult patients with PCR-confirmed acute COVID-19 hospitalized during the Delta variant predominance (October-November 2021) in Slovenia. Among the 529 enrolled patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (median age, 65 years; 58.2% men), 175 (33.1%) were fully vaccinated at the time of symptom onset. Compared with 345 unvaccinated patients, fully vaccinated patients with breakthrough infections were older, more often immunocompromised, and had higher Charlson comorbidity index scores. After adjusting for sex, age, and comorbidities, fully vaccinated patients had lower odds for progressing to critically severe disease and were discharged from the hospital earlier than unvaccinated patients. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 remains an extremely effective intervention to alleviate morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients."	"2077-0383

We analyzed "excess mortality" rates (the difference between total deaths and what would have been expected based on earlier time periods) prepared by the CDC for the United States from January 3, 2020 to September 26, 2021. Between Jan. 3, 2020 and Sept. 26, 2021, there were 895,693 excess deaths associated with COVID-19, 26% more than reported as such. The proportion of deaths estimated by the excess mortality method that was reported as COVID-19 was highest in the Northeast (92%) and lowest in the West (72%) and South (76%). Of the estimated deaths, 43% occurred between Oct. 4, 2020 and Feb. 27, 2021. Before May 31, 2020, approximately 56% of deaths were in the Northeast, where 17% of the population resides. Subsequently, 48% of deaths were in the South, which makes up 38% of the population. Since May 31, 2020, the South experienced COVID-19 mortality 26% higher than the national rate, whereas the Northeast's rate was 42% lower. If each region had the same mortality rate as the Northeast, more than 316,234 COVID-19 deaths between May 31, 2020 and Sept. 26, 2021 were "avoidable." More than half (63%) of the avoidable deaths occurred between May 31, 2020 and February, 2021, and more than half (60%) were in the South. Regional differences in COVID-19 mortality have been strong throughout the pandemic. The South has had higher mortality rates than the rest of the U.S. since May 31, 2020, and experienced 62% of the avoidable deaths. A comprehensive COVID-19 policy, including population-based restrictions as well as vaccines, is needed to control the pandemic."	"1932-6203

Vaccination"	"Population-level data on COVID-19 vaccine uptake in pregnancy and SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes are lacking. We describe COVID-19 vaccine uptake and SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women in Scotland, using whole-population data from a national, prospective cohort. Between the start of a COVID-19 vaccine program in Scotland, on 8 December 2020 and 31 October 2021, 25,917 COVID-19 vaccinations were given to 18,457 pregnant women. Vaccine coverage was substantially lower in pregnant women than in the general female population of 18-44 years; 32.3% of women giving birth in October 2021 had two doses of vaccine compared to 77.4% in all women. The extended perinatal mortality rate for women who gave birth within 28 d of a COVID-19 diagnosis was 22.6 per 1,000 births (95% CI 12.9-38.5; pandemic background rate 5.6 per 1,000 births; 452 out of 80,456; 95% CI 5.1-6.2). Overall, 77.4% (3,833 out of 4,950; 95% CI 76.2-78.6) of SARS-CoV-2 infections, 90.9% (748 out of 823; 95% CI 88.7-92.7) of SARS-CoV-2 associated with hospital admission and 98% (102 out of 104; 95% CI 92.5-99.7) of SARS-CoV-2 associated with critical care admission, as well as all baby deaths, occurred in pregnant women who were unvaccinated at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Addressing low vaccine uptake rates in pregnant women is imperative to protect the health of women and babies in the ongoing pandemic."	"1546-170x

A secondary objective was to describe causes of deaths occurred in the days after vaccination. We conducted a retrospective observational study on all residents of Bologna Health Authority who received at least one COVID-19 vaccination dose from December 27, 2020 to December 31, 2021 and compared mortality in the 3, 7, 14 30 days after vaccination (risk interval) with the mortality in the period of the same length (3, 7, 14 and 30 days) beyond the 30th day after the last dose of vaccination (control interval). The cohort included 717,538 people. The mortality rate was 2.24 per 100 person-years during the 30 days risk interval vs 2.72 in the control interval with an adjusted incidence rate ratio equal to 0.76 (95% CI: 0.70-0.83, p < 0.001). The risk of mortality is significantly lower (p < 0.001) also in the 3, 7, 14 days risk intervals than in the control intervals. This study shows that there is no increase in mortality in the short-term period after COVID-19 vaccines."	"1873-2518

Public health"	"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 outcomes among hospitalized patients may have changed due to new variants, therapies and vaccine availability. We assessed outcomes of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 2020-February 2022. METHODS: Data were retrieved from electronic health medical records of adult COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a large community health system. Duration was split into March 2020-June 2021 (pre-Delta period), July-November 2021 (Delta period), and December 2021-February 2022 (Omicron period). RESULTS: Of included patients (n = 9582), 75% were admitted during pre-Delta, 9% during Delta, 16% during Omicron period. The COVID-positive inpatients were oldest during Omicron period but had lowest rates of COVID pneumonia and resource utilization (p < 0.0001); 46% were vaccinated during Delta and 61% during Omicron period (p < 0.0001). After adjustment for demographics and comorbidities, vaccination was associated with lower inpatient mortality (OR = 0.47 (0.34-0.65), p < 0.0001). The Omicron period was independently associated with lower risk of inpatient mortality (OR = 0.61 (0.45-0.82), p = 0.0010). Vaccination and Omicron period admission were also independently associated with lower healthcare resource utilization (p < 0.05). Magnitudes of associations varied between age groups with strongest protective effects seen in younger patients. CONCLUSION: Outcomes of COVID-19 inpatients were evolving throughout the pandemic and were affected by changing demographics, virus variants, and vaccination. KEY POINT: In this observational study of almost 10,000 patients hospitalized from March 2020-February 2022 with COVID-19, age and having multiple comorbidities remained consistent risk factors for mortality regardless of the variant. Vaccination was high in our hospitalized patients. Vaccination conveyed less severe illness and was associated with lower inpatient mortality."	"1471-2334

Vaccination"	"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccination has been proved to be effective in preventing hospitalization and illness progression, even though data on mortality of vaccinated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are conflicting. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of vaccinated patients admitted to ICU according to their immunization cycle and to outline the risk factors for 28-day mortality. This observational study included adult patients admitted to ICU for acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to SARS-CoV-2 and who had received at least one dose of vaccine. RESULTS: Fully vaccination was defined as a complete primary cycle from < 120 days or a booster dose from > 14 days. All the other patients were named partially vaccinated. One-hundred sixty patients (91 fully and 69 partially vaccinated) resulted eligible, showing a 28-day mortality rate of 51.9%. Compared to partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated were younger (69 [60-77.5] vs. 74 [66-79] years, p 0.029), more frequently immunocompromised (39.56% vs. 14.39%, p 0.003), and affected by at least one comorbidity (90.11% vs 78.26%, p 0.045), mainly chronic kidney disease (CKD) (36.26% vs 20.29%, p 0.035). At multivariable analysis, independent predictors of 28-day mortality were as follows: older age [OR 1.05 (CI 95% 1.01-1.08), p 0.005], history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [OR 3.05 (CI 95% 1.28-7.30), p 0.012], immunosuppression [OR 3.70 (CI 95% 1.63-8.40), p 0.002], and admission respiratory and hemodynamic status [PaO(2)/FiO(2) and septic shock: OR 0.99 (CI 95% 0.98-0.99), p 0.009 and 2.74 (CI 95% 1.16-6.48), p 0.022, respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a full vaccination cycle, severe COVID-19 may occur in patients with relevant comorbidities, especially immunosuppression and CKD. Regardless the immunization status, predisposing conditions (i.e., older age, COPD, and immunosuppression) and a severe clinical presentation were predictors of 28-day mortality."	"2731-3786

SARS-CoV-2"	"IMPORTANCE: The number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths prevented among vaccinated persons, independent of the effect of reduced transmission, is a key measure of vaccine impact. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths prevented among vaccinated adults in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this modeling study, a multiplier model was used to extrapolate the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-associated deaths from data on the number of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations stratified by state, month, and age group (18-49, 50-64, and ≥65 years) in the US from December 1, 2020, to September 30, 2021. These estimates were combined with data on vaccine coverage and effectiveness to estimate the risks of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Risks were applied to the US population 18 years or older to estimate the expected burden in that population without vaccination. The estimated burden in the US population 18 years or older given observed levels of vaccination was subtracted from the expected burden in the US population 18 years or older without vaccination (ie, counterfactual) to estimate the impact of vaccination among vaccinated persons. EXPOSURES: Completion of the COVID-19 vaccination course, defined as 2 doses of messenger RNA (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) vaccines or 1 dose of JNJ-78436735 vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Monthly numbers and percentages of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths prevented were estimated among those who have been vaccinated in the US. RESULTS: COVID-19 vaccination was estimated to prevent approximately 27 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 22 million to 34 million) infections, 1.6 million (95% UI, 1.4 million to 1.8 million) hospitalizations, and 235 000 (95% UI, 175 000-305 000) deaths in the US from December 1, 2020, to September 30, 2021, among vaccinated adults 18 years or older. From September 1 to September 30, 2021, vaccination was estimated to prevent 52% (95% UI, 45%-62%) of expected infections, 56% (95% UI, 52%-62%) of expected hospitalizations, and 58% (95% UI, 53%-63%) of expected deaths in adults 18 years or older. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings indicate that the US COVID-19 vaccination program prevented a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality through direct protection of vaccinated individuals."

METHODS: We performed a population-based cohort study in Norway covering the time from 1 July 2022 to 15 January 2023, including individuals ≥75 years of age who had received at least a third dose. Using Cox proportional hazard models on severe COVID-19-associated outcome measures and all-cause mortality, we estimated the vaccine effectiveness of mono- and bivalent vaccines, comparing fourth- to third-dose recipients (>24 weeks ago). Vaccine status was included as a time-varying covariate and models were adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: We included 408 073 individuals. A fourth dose with either monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccine showed increased protection against COVID-19-associated mortality relative to a third dose in individuals ≥75 years of age. We estimated a protective effect for the bivalent BA.1 vaccine [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.08, 95% CI 0.02-0.32] relative to the bivalent BA.4-5 (aHR 0.27, 95% CI 0.14-0.56) and a monovalent dose (aHR 0.34, 95% CI 0.26-0.45) 2-9 weeks after vaccination compared with recipients with a third dose >24 weeks ago. The increased protective effect waned with no added protection for the monovalent vaccine after 33 weeks compared with a third dose. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate an increased protective effect of a fourth dose against severe outcomes compared with a third dose, with decreasing effect with time since the last dose."	"1464-3685

We limited our search to the patients with positive COVID‑19 laboratory tests from 1 January 2020 to 31 March 2021 and who filled a prescription for any influenza vaccine during the 2019-2020 influenza season. In total, we included 116,277 patients and used a generalized linear model to analyze the data.We found out that patients aged 60+ who received an influenza vaccination have a lower probability of death caused by COVID-19 in comparison to unvaccinated, and the magnitude of this difference grows with age. For people below 60 years old, we did not observe an influence of the vaccination. Our results suggest a potential protective effect of the influenza vaccine on COVID-19 mortality of the elderly. Administration of the influenza vaccine before the influenza season would reduce the burden of increased influenza incidence, the risk of influenza and COVID‑19 coinfection and render the essential medical resources accessible to cope with another wave of COVID-19. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing a correlation between influenza vaccination and the COVID-19 mortality rate in Poland."	"2076-393x

This study aimed to determine and compare the morbidity and mortality rates due to COVID-19 among the HCWs and the general population (non-HCWs). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review. We accessed electronic database of participants admitted at Mulago National Referral Hospital COVID-19 Treatment Unit (CTU) between March 2020 and September 2021. Participants with missing occupations were excluded. RESULTS: Of 594 eligible participants, 6.4% (n = 38) were HCWs. Compared with non-HCWs, HCWs were much younger (48 versus 55 years, p = 0.020). The proportion of participants with severe disease (73.7% versus 77.6%, p = 0.442), who had not received COVID-19 vaccine (91.2% versus 94.7%, p = 0.423), mortality rate (44.7% versus 54.8%, p = 0.243) and the median length of hospitalization (6 versus 7 days, p = 0.913) were similar among HCWs and non-HCWs, respectively. A higher proportion of HCWs required oxygen therapy (24.3% versus 9.7%, p < 0.01). At admission, the presence of cough (p = 0.723), breathlessness (p = 0.722), fever (p = 0.19), sore throat (p = 0.133), comorbidities (p = 0.403) and headache (p = 0.162) were similar across groups. Rhinorrhoea was more common among HCWs (34.4% versus 16.6%, p = 0.017). Among HCWs, nurses had the highest morbidity (52.6%) and mortality (58.8%). CONCLUSION: The morbidity and mortality among HCWs in Uganda were substantial, with a low COVID-19 vaccination rate and a higher requirement for oxygen therapy despite a younger age."	"2049-937x

Particularly in patients with thoracic malignancies receiving anticancer treatments, the safety of these vaccines has so far been little investigated. METHODS: This is a prospective trial of patients with thoracic cancer receiving anticancer treatments and COVID-19 vaccines at the Division of Thoracic Oncology of European Institute of Oncology between February and September 2021. RESULTS: A total 207 patients affected by thoracic cancers (199 lung cancers and 8 mesotheliomas) had received Covid-19 vaccines (206 mRNA vaccines and 1 virus-vectored vaccine). The majority of patients had at least one comorbidity (76.3%). They were concomitantly treating with targeted therapy (TT) (45.9%), immunotherapy (IO) (22.7%), and chemotherapy (CT) (14%). A total of 64 AEs (15.6%) were observed after administration of Sars-Cov-2 vaccine. The majority of AEs were grade 1 [G1] (6.3%) and G2 (8.8%), only two events were G3 (0.5%). The median follow-up was 9 months (range 1-22 months), during this follow-up 21 patients (10.1%) had a positive nasal swab, most of the patients were asymptomatic (67%) and the symptomatic ones (33%) had mild symptoms and fewer complications and hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 m-RNA vaccines appear to be safe in the cohort of patients with thoracic malignances in active treatment, including those receiving immunotherapy. Considering the high morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer receiving active treatments, our study supports the current vaccine prioritization, third and/or fourth dose, of all cancer patients with active treatment."

DESIGN: Deterministic, compartmental, discrete-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) modelling. PARTICIPANTS: Population in England. INTERVENTIONS: Mass vaccination programmes. OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily and cumulative number of deaths from COVID-19. RESULTS: If vaccine efficacy remains high (85%), the vaccine-induced sterilising immunity lasts ≥182 days, and the reinfectivity is greatly reduced (by ≥60%), annual mass vaccination programmes can prevent further COVID-19 outbreaks in England. Under optimistic scenarios, with annual revaccination programmes, the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths is estimated to be from 130 000 to 150 000 by the end of 2024. However, the total number of COVID-19 deaths may be up to 431 000 by the end of 2024, under scenarios with compromised vaccine efficacy (62.5%), short duration of natural and vaccine immunity (365/182 days) and small reduction in reinfectivity (30%). Under the assumed scenarios, more frequent revaccinations are associated with smaller total numbers and lower peaks of daily deaths from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Under optimistic scenarios, mass immunisation using efficacious vaccines may enable society safely to return to normality. However, under plausible scenarios with low vaccine efficacy and short durability of immunity, COVID-19 could continue to cause recurrent waves of severe morbidity and mortality despite frequent vaccinations. It is crucial to monitor the vaccination effects in the real world, and to better understand characteristics of naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity against SARS-CoV-2."	"2044-6055

We aimed to assess the population-level reduction in cumulative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases, hospitalizations, and mortality due to the BNT162b2 mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination campaign in Israel during January-February 2021. METHODS: A susceptible-infected-recovered/removed (SIR) model and a Dynamic Survival Analysis (DSA) statistical approach were used. Daily counts of individuals who tested positive and of vaccine doses administered, obtained from the Israeli Ministry of Health, were used to calibrate the model. The model was parameterized using values derived from a previous phase of the pandemic during which similar lockdown and other preventive measures were implemented in order to take into account the effect of these prevention measures on COVID-19 spread. RESULTS: Our model predicted for the total population a reduction of 648 585 SARS-CoV-2 cases (75% confidence interval [CI], 25 877-1 396 963) during the first 2 months of the vaccination campaign. The number of averted hospitalizations for moderate to severe conditions was 16 101 (75% CI, 2010-33 035), and reduction of death was estimated at 5123 (75% CI, 388-10 815) fatalities. Among children aged 0-19 years, we estimated a reduction of 163 436 (75% CI, 0-433 233) SARS-CoV-2 cases, which we consider to be an indirect effect of the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the rapid vaccination campaign prevented hundreds of thousands of new cases as well as thousands of hospitalizations and fatalities and has probably averted a major health care crisis."

However, the emergence of the Omicron variant and subvariants as the globally dominant strains have raised doubts about the effectiveness of currently available vaccines and prompted debate about potential future vaccination strategies. AREAS COVERED: Using the publicly available IVAC VIEW-hub platform, we reviewed 52 studies on vaccine effectiveness (VE) after booster vaccinations. VE were reported for SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic infection, severe disease and death and stratified by vaccine schedule and age. In addition, a non-systematic literature review of safety was performed to identify single or multi-country studies investigating adverse event rates for at least two of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines. EXPERT OPINION: Booster shots of the current COVID-19 vaccines provide consistently high protection against Omicron-related severe disease and death. Additionally, this protection appears to be conserved for at least 3 months, with a small but significant waning after that. The positive risk-benefit ratio of these vaccines is well established, giving us confidence to administer additional doses as required. Future vaccination strategies will likely include a combination of schedules based on risk profile, as overly frequent boosting may be neither beneficial nor sustainable for the general population."

In our study we compared the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines to prevent COVID-19-related infections and mortality. METHODS: 17 randomized clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines were included after search in databases. We compared COVID-19 vaccines based on symptomatic and severe infections, number of deaths and hospitalizations related to COVID-19. Also, we analyzed the efficacy of COVID-19 against different variants of SARS-CoV-2 as well as according to different age groups. Random effects model using Mantel-Haenzeal method was used to pool relative risk (RR). RESULTS: Our meta-analysis shows that full vaccination could decrease not only the risk of symptomatic or severe COVID-19, the risk of hospitalization and death caused by COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines were also effective against variants of SARS-CoV-2 (RR = 0.36; 95% CI [0.25; 0.53], p < 0.0001). However, efficacy of vaccination varied in COVID-19 variant-dependent manner. Moreover, the analysis in different age groups showed that COVID-19 vaccines had the similar results: the risk was slightly lower in adults compared to elderly cohort [Formula: see text] 65 years): (RR = 0.16, 95% CI [0.11; 0.23]) and (RR = 0.19, 95% CI [0.12; 0.30]), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Data obtained from clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines looks promising, in order to fully investigate efficacy of the vaccines further clinical examination is required especially considering new SARS-CoV-2 variants."

However, the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines wane over time leading to breakthrough infections where vaccinated individuals experience a COVID-19 infection. Here we estimate the risks of breakthrough infection and subsequent hospitalization in individuals with common comorbidities who had completed an initial vaccination series. METHODS: Our study population included vaccinated patients between January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022 who are present in the Truveta patient population. Models were developed to describe 1) time from completing primary vaccination series till breakthrough infection; and 2) if a patient was hospitalized within 14 days of breakthrough infection. We adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, sex, and year-month of vaccination. RESULTS: Of 1,218,630 patients in the Truveta Platform who had completed an initial vaccination sequence between January 1, 2021 and March 31, 2022, 2.85, 3.42, 2.75, and 2.88 percent of patients with CKD, chronic lung disease, diabetes, or are in an immunocompromised state experienced breakthrough infection, respectively, compared to 1.46 percent of the population without any of these four comorbidities. We found an increased risk of breakthrough infection and subsequent hospitalization in individuals with any of the four comorbidities when compared to individuals without these four comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinated individuals with any of the studied comorbidities experienced an increased risk of breakthrough COVID-19 infection and subsequent hospitalizations compared to the people without any of the studied comorbidities. Individuals with immunocompromising conditions and chronic lung disease were most at risk of breakthrough infection, while people with CKD were most at risk of hospitalization following breakthrough infection. Patients with multiple comorbidities have an even greater risk of breakthrough infection or hospitalization compared to patients with none of the studied comorbidities. Individuals with common comorbidities should remain vigilant against infection even if vaccinated."	"1873-2518

This wave peaked on March 4, 2022, with 8,764 COVID-19 cases per million population (2), resulting in a total of 1,049,959 cases and 5,906 COVID-19-associated deaths reported to the Hong Kong Department of Health during January 6-March 21, 2022.(†) Throughout this period, the COVID-19 mortality rate in Hong Kong (37.7 per million population) was among the highest reported worldwide since the COVID-19 pandemic began (3). Publicly available data on age-specific vaccination coverage in Hong Kong with a 2-dose primary vaccination series (with either Sinovac-CoronaVac [Sinovac], an inactivated COVID-19 viral vaccine, recommended for persons aged ≥3 years or BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech], an mRNA vaccine, for persons aged ≥5 years), as of December 23, 2021,(§)(,)(¶) and COVID-19 mortality during January 6-March 21, 2022, were analyzed. By December 23, 2021, 67% of vaccine-eligible persons in Hong Kong had received ≥1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, 64% had received ≥2 doses, and 5% had received a booster dose. Among persons aged ≥60 years, these proportions were 52%, 49%, and 7%, respectively. Among those aged ≥60 years, vaccination coverage declined with age: 48% of persons aged 70-79 years had received ≥1 dose, 45% received ≥2 doses, and 7% had received a booster, and among those aged ≥80 years, 20%, 18%, and 2% had received ≥1 dose, ≥2 doses, and a booster dose, respectively. Among 5,906 COVID-19 deaths reported, 5,655 (96%) occurred in persons aged ≥60 years**; among these decedents, 3,970 (70%) were unvaccinated, 18% (1,023) had received 1 vaccine dose, and 12% (662) had received ≥2 doses. The overall rates of COVID-19-associated mortality among persons aged ≥60 years who were unvaccinated, who had received 1 COVID-19 vaccine dose, and who had received ≥2 vaccine doses were 10,076, 1,099, and 473 per million population, respectively; the risk for COVID-19-associated death among unvaccinated persons was 21.3 times that among recipients of 2-3 doses in this age group. The high overall mortality rate during the ongoing 2022 Hong Kong Omicron COVID-19 outbreak is being driven by deaths among unvaccinated persons aged ≥60 years. Efforts to identify and address gaps in age-specific vaccination coverage can help prevent high mortality from COVID-19, especially among persons aged ≥60 years."	"1545-861x

Constantly evolving evidence regarding incidence and case fatality of COVID-19 and myocarditis related to infection or vaccination, creates challenges for risk-benefit analysis of vaccination. Challenges are complicated further by emerging evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness, and variable effectiveness against variants. Here, we build on previous work on the COVID-19 Risk Calculator (CoRiCal) by integrating Australian and international data to inform a Bayesian network that calculates probabilities of outcomes for the delta variant under different scenarios of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine coverage, age groups (≥12 years), sex, community transmission intensity and vaccine effectiveness. The model estimates that in a population where 5% were unvaccinated, 5% had one dose, 60% had two doses and 30% had three doses, there was a substantially greater probability of developing (239-5847 times) and dying (1430-384,684 times) from COVID-19-related than vaccine-associated myocarditis (depending on age and sex). For one million people with this vaccine coverage, where transmission intensity was equivalent to 10% chance of infection over 2 months, 68,813 symptomatic COVID-19 cases and 981 deaths would be prevented, with 42 and 16 expected cases of vaccine-associated myocarditis in males and females, respectively. These results justify vaccination in all age groups as vaccine-associated myocarditis is generally mild in the young, and there is unequivocal evidence for reduced mortality from COVID-19 in older individuals. The model may be updated to include emerging best evidence, data pertinent to different countries or vaccines and other outcomes such as long COVID."	"2059-0105

We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and deaths among HCWs. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study, from February 9 to June 30, 2021, using national registries of health care workers, laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 and deaths. We calculated the vaccine effectiveness for preventing laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-mortality, and all-cause mortality among partially immunized and fully immunized HCWs. An extension of Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the mortality results, and Poisson regression was used to model SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The study included 606,772 eligible HCWs, the mean age was 40 (IQR: 33.0, 51.0). In fully immunized HCW, the effectiveness for preventing all-cause mortality was 83.6 (95% CI: 80.2 to 86.4), 88.7 (95% CI: 85.1 to 91.4) for preventing COVID-19 mortality, and 40.3 (95% CI 38.9 to 41.6) for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: The BBIBP-CorV vaccine showed high levels of effectiveness for preventing all-cause and COVID-19 deaths among fully immunized HCW. These results were consistent within different subgroups and sensitivity analyses. However, the effectiveness for preventing infection was suboptimal in this particular setting."	"1873-0442

To date, there are no direct comparisons of the course of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients between the pre- and post-vaccine era. We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 infections and their impact on cancer in COVID-19 vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients from three German cancer centers. Overall, 133 patients with SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled in pre- and post-vaccine eras: 84 non-vaccinated and 49 vaccinated, respectively. A mild course of COVID-19 was documented more frequently in vaccinated patients (49% vs. 29%), while the frequency of severe and critical courses occurred in approximately one-half of the non-vaccinated patients (22% vs. 42%, p = 0.023). Particularly, patients with hematologic neoplasms benefited from vaccination in this context (p = 0.031). Admissions to intermediate- and intensive-care units and the necessity of non-invasive and invasive respiratory support were reduced by 71% and 50% among vaccinated patients, respectively. The median length of admission was 11 days for non-vaccinated and 5 days for vaccinated patients (p = 0.002). COVID-19 mortality was reduced by 83% in vaccinated patients (p = 0.046). Finally, the median time from SARS-CoV-2 infection to restarting cancer therapy was 12 and 26 days among vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups, respectively (p = 0.002). Although this study does not have enough power to perform multivariate analyses to account for confounders, it provides data on COVID-19 in non-vaccinated and vaccinated cancer patients and illustrates the potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccines for these patients."

We aimed to study the coronary thrombo-embolic complications (CTE) after COVID-19 vaccination in a single centre during the initial 3 months of vaccination drive in India. All patients admitted to our hospital between 1st March 2021 and 31st May 2021 with Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were included. Of the 89 patients [Age 55 (47-64)y, 13f] with ACS and angiographic evidence of coronary thrombus, 37 (42%) had prior vaccination history. The timing from last vaccination dose to index event was <1, 1-2, 2-4 and >4 weeks in 9(24%), 4(11%), 15(41%) and 9 (24%) respectively. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 (Covishield) was the most used vaccine- 28 (76%), while 9 (24%) had BBV152 (Covaxin). Baseline characteristics were similar in both vaccinated (VG) and non-vaccinated group (NVG), except for symptom to door time [8.5 (5.75-14) vs 14.5 (7.25-24) hrs, p = 0.003]. Thrombocytopenia was not noted in any of the VG patients, while 2 (3.8%) of NVG patient had thrombocytopenia (p = 0.51). The pre- Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow was significantly lower [1 (0-3) vs2 (1-3), p = 0.03) and thrombus grade were significantly higher [4 (2.5-5) vs 2 (1-3), p = 0.0005] in VG. The in-hospital (2.7% vs 1.9%, p = 1.0) and 30-day mortality were also similar (5.4% vs 5.8%, p = 1.0). This is the first report of CTE after COVID-19 vaccination during the first 3 months of vaccination drive in India. We need further reports to identify the incidence of this rare but serious adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination."	"2213-3763

Central to this debate is quantifying the contribution of adolescents and children to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the potential impact of vaccinating these age groups. In this study, we present a novel SEIR mathematical disease transmission model that quantifies the impact of different vaccination strategies on population-level SARS-CoV-2 infections and clinical outcomes. The model employs both age- and time-dependent social mixing patterns to capture the impact of changes in restrictions. The model was used to assess the impact of vaccinating adolescents and children on the natural history of the COVID-19 pandemic across all age groups, using the UK as an example. The base case model demonstrates significant increases in COVID-19 disease burden in the UK following a relaxation of restrictions, if vaccines are limited to those ≥18 years and vulnerable adolescents (≥12 years). Including adolescents and children in the vaccination program could reduce overall COVID-related mortality by 57%, and reduce cases of long COVID by 75%. This study demonstrates that vaccinating adolescents and children has the potential to play a vital role in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, and subsequent COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, across all ages. Our results have major global public health implications and provide valuable information to inform a potential pandemic exit strategy."	"2076-393x

Interaction between vaccine-induced immunity and naturally acquired immunity at the population level has been understudied. METHODS: We used regression models to evaluate whether the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines differed across states with different levels of naturally acquired immunity from March 2021 to April 2022 in the United States. Analysis was conducted for 3 evaluation periods separately (Alpha, Delta, and Omicron waves). As a proxy for the proportion of the population with naturally acquired immunity, we used either the reported seroprevalence or the estimated proportion of the population ever infected in each state. RESULTS: COVID-19 mortality decreased as coverage of ≥1 dose increased among people ≥65 years of age, and this effect did not vary by seroprevalence or proportion of the total population ever infected. Seroprevalence and proportion ever infected were not associated with COVID-19 mortality, after controlling for vaccine coverage. These findings were consistent in all evaluation periods. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a sustained reduction in mortality at state level during the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron periods. The effect did not vary by naturally acquired immunity."	"1537-6613

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines demonstrate reduced immunogenicity in these patients. OBJECTIVES: To understand whether the risk of severe COVID-19 in individuals with PID or SID has changed following the deployment of vaccination and therapeutics in the context of the emergence of novel viral variants of concern. METHODS: The outcomes of two cohorts of patients with PID and SID were compared: the first, infected between March and July 2020, prior to vaccination and treatments, the second after these intervention became available between January 2021 and April 2022. RESULTS: 22.7% of immunodeficient patients have been infected at least once with SARS-CoV-2 since the start of the pandemic, compared to over 70% of the general population. Immunodeficient patients were typically infected later in the pandemic when the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant was dominant. This delay was associated with receipt of more vaccine doses and higher pre-infection seroprevalence. Compared to March-July 2020, hospitalization rates (53.3% vs 17.9%, p<0.0001) and mortality (Infection fatality rate 20.0% vs 3.4%, p=0.0003) have significantly reduced for patients with PID but remain elevated compared to the general population. The presence of a serological response to vaccination was associated with a reduced duration of viral detection by PCR in the nasopharynx. Early outpatient treatment with antivirals or monoclonal antibodies reduced hospitalization during the Omicron wave. CONCLUSIONS: Most individuals with immunodeficiency in the United Kingdom remain SARS-CoV-2 infection naïve. Vaccination, widespread availability of outpatient treatments and, possibly, the emergence of the B.1.1.529 variant have led to significant improvements in morbidity and mortality followings SARS-CoV-2 infection since the start of the pandemic. However, individuals with PID and SID remain at significantly increased risk of poor outcomes compared to the general population; mitigation, vaccination and treatment strategies must be optimized to minimize the ongoing burden of the pandemic in these vulnerable cohorts."

It is recommended for all individuals including patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, safety data are lacking in this group of patients. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the short- and long-term vaccine related adverse events (AEs) in patients with IBD. METHODS: This is a prospective, observational cohort study investigating short- and long-term AEs related to the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with IBD (study group) after the first and second dose compared to healthy participants (control group). Patients were recruited at the time of attendance to the clinic or infusion rooms. Short term (<3 weeks) localized and systemic AEs were assessed via questionnaire. Follow-up phone-based survey was made to collect data on long term (up to 24 weeks) AEs. RESULTS: A total of 408 patients answered the questionnaires, 204 patients in each group, the study and control group. No serious adverse events were reported in either the study or the control group after the first or the second dose. Participants in the control group reported more frequent pain at the injection site than those in the study group after the first dose [58 (57%) vs. 38 (37%) respectively, P = 0.005]. After the second dose, tiredness was reported more frequently in the control group [49 (48%)] compared to the study group [25 (24%) (P < 0.001)]. At 20-24 weeks post vaccination, 386 out of 408 (94.6%) patients were willing to participate in the follow-up phone based questionnaire [196 (96.1%) in the study group vs. 190 (93.1%) in the control group]. In both groups, none of the patients reported local, systemic, or severe adverse events (0 out of 386) at week 20-24 post second dose. CONCLUSION: The BNT162b2 vaccine is safe in patients with IBD. No severe or long-term adverse events were reported in our study. The frequency of local and systemic adverse events after the second dose was generally higher among healthy participants compared to patients with IBD. Further studies including a larger cohort with a longer follow-up duration are needed to assess for possible rare adverse events."	"2296-858x

METHODS: An individual-based transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, OpenCOVID, was developed to compare the impact of various vaccination and NPI strategies on the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland. OpenCOVID uses the Oxford Containment Health Index (OCHI) to quantify the stringency of NPIs. RESULTS: Even if NPIs in place in March 2021 were to be maintained and the vaccine campaigns rollout rapidly scaled-up, a 'third wave' was predicted. However, we find a cautious phased relaxation can substantially reduce population-level morbidity and mortality. We find that a faster vaccination campaign can offset the size of such a wave, allowing more flexibility for NPIs to be relaxed sooner. Model outcomes were most sensitive to the level of infectiousness of variants of concern observed in Switzerland. CONCLUSION: A rapid vaccination rollout can allow the sooner relaxation of NPIs, however ongoing surveillance of - and swift responses to - emerging viral variants is of utmost importance for epidemic control."

This case-control study aimed to compare different blood parameters, and prognostic and survival outcomes of COVID-19 patients based on vaccination status. METHODS: We performed a case-control study that included hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal. Individuals who received vaccination were designated as cases and unvaccinated individuals as controls. Demographics, co-morbidity, clinical data, laboratory data, and disease outcomes were recorded for both groups. Multivariate, Cox, and linear regression were used for analysing blood parameters, hospital admission, survival, and hospital stay, respectively, between cases and controls. RESULTS: Out of 100 participants enrolled, 46 were vaccinated, and 54 weren't. At admission, ferritin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were significantly lower in cases. At discharge, cases showed a higher monocyte than controls. Ferritin, ESR, and d-imer showed excellent performance in determining the severity of symptoms. Significant correlation and regression of ferritin and ESR with the length of hospital stay was observed. Length of hospital stay was significantly lower in cases than in controls. No significant differences between cases and controls were observed in mortality. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccines effectively reduced hospitalization duration. Ferritin and ESR were significantly lower in vaccinated individuals and showed the best utility in monitoring the disease."	"2398-8835

As vaccines are developed and introduced, their effect on the disease on both, the global and individual scale is a subject of intense curiosity. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between risk factors for hospitalization, disease severity, and vaccination status in COVID-19 inpatients in a pandemic hospital. METHODOLOGY: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between June and September 2021 were retrospectively analyzed in three groups: unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, and fully vaccinated. Disease severity was classified as moderate, severe, or critical according to World Health Organization criteria, and mortality risk factors and the prognostic effect of vaccination were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 486 patients, 228 women (46.9 %) and 258 men (53.1 %), with a mean age of 55.4 ± 16.5 years. Of these, 264 patients (54.3 %) were unvaccinated, 147 (30.2 %) were incompletely vaccinated, and 75 (15.4 %) were fully vaccinated. Older age, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, greater disease severity, and being unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated were associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study indicate that age, disease severity, comorbidities, and vaccination status were factors affecting COVID-19 mortality. Our findings support that full vaccination reduces COVID-19 -related mortality rates, disease severity, and length of hospital stay. However, large-scale studies with larger patient populations are needed (Tab. 2, Ref. 22)."	"Sezen, Ysegul Inci

Patients admitted to ICU due to COVID-19 between 1 April 2021 and 15 May 2021 were enrolled to the study. Clinical, laboratory, radiological parameters, hospital and ICU mortality were compared between vaccinated patients and eligible but unvaccinated patients. Patients over 65 years old were the target population of the study due to the national vaccination schedule. Data from 90 patients were evaluated. Of these, 36 (40.0%) were vaccinated. All patients had the CoronaVac vaccine. Lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels were higher in an unvaccinated group than vaccinated group (P = 0.021 and 0.008, respectively). SpO2 from the first arterial blood gas at ICU was 83.71 ± 19.50% in vaccinated, 92.36 ± 6.59% in unvaccinated patients (P = 0.003). Length of ICU and hospital stay were not different (P = 0.204, 0.092, respectively). ICU and hospital mortality were similar between groups (P = 0.11 and 0.70, respectively). CoronaVac vaccine had no effect on survival from COVID-19. CoronaVac's protective effect, especially on new genetic variants, should be investigated further."	"1469-4409

However, some developing countries are still a long way from achieving herd immunity through vaccination. In some territories, such as the Colombian Amazon, mass immunization strategies have been implemented with the CoronaVac® vaccine. Due to its proximity to Brazil, where one of the variants of interest of SARS-CoV-2 circulates. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of the CoronaVac® vaccine in a population of the Colombian Amazon. METHODS: Between February 24, 2021, and August 10, 2021, a descriptive observational study was carried out in which a population of individuals over 18 years of age immunized with two doses of the CoronaVac® vaccine was evaluated. The study site was in the municipality of Mitú, Vaupés, in southeastern Colombia, a region located in the Amazon bordering Brazil. RESULTS: 99% of the urban population of the Mitú municipality were vaccinated with CoronaVac®. To date, 5.7% of vaccinated individuals have become ill, and only 0.1% of these require hospitalization. One death was attributable to COVID-19 has been reported among vaccinated individuals, and the vaccine has shown 94.3% effectiveness against mild disease and 99.9% against severe infection. CONCLUSIONS: The herd immunity achieved through mass vaccination in this population has made it possible to reduce the rate of complicated cases and mortality from COVID-19 in this region of the Colombian Amazon. HIGHLIGHTS: CoronaVac® has shown 94.3% effectiveness against mild disease and 99.9% against severe infection in this indigenous population. CoronaVac® reduces the mortality rate from 2.2% in 2020 to 0.22% in 2021. The herd immunity was achieved through mass vaccination in this region of the Colombian Amazon."	"2055-0936

*Vaccines"	"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID)-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented pressures on societies around the world. Successful vaccines, developed against the spike protein of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, offer hope that new hospitalisations and new deaths will subside. However, vaccination takes place in a dynamic environment. For example, new variants of the disease may occur where the effectiveness of a vaccine lies below that of the original target of the vaccine, while changes in the behaviour of a population are accompanied by a changed basic reproduction number. Here, we aim to understand how changes in values of basic parameters affect the benefits of vaccination at the direct level, of the individuals vaccinated, and at the indirect level, of the wider, unvaccinated community. We work within the framework of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, and produce a metric for the benefits of vaccination, at both direct and indirect levels, in terms of the number of avoided deaths. Taking into account the initial prevalence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the mortality rate of the disease, the basic reproduction number, the vaccination rate, and the effectiveness of a vaccine, we explore how these basic parameters affect the benefits of vaccination. We find a range of situations where indirect benefits of vaccination outweigh direct benefits. This especially occurs at lower rates of vaccination (20% - [Formula: see text]) and intermediate values of the basic reproduction number (1-1.5). The indirect benefits can be substantial, in some cases being more than 400% of the direct benefits. For an initial prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of 2%, a basic reproduction number of 1.2, a mortality rate of 2%, and a vaccine effectiveness of 95%, our findings show, for a population of 500,000 people, where 100,000 susceptible individuals are vaccinated, that approximately 2200 deaths are avoided. However, approximately 600 of these deaths are avoided amongst vaccinated individuals, while approximately 1600 deaths are avoided in the wider, unvaccinated community."	"2045-2322

Vaccines, advent of effective treatment and the emergence of novel variants have fundamentally changed the pandemic. We aimed to assess temporal changes of COVID-19 in HD patients of our catchment area, and risk factors for severe and fatal course. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively collected data from 274 patients admitted to the Medical University Graz, Austria for HD between 1st of May 2020 and 31st of August 2022. We analyzed clinical and demographic data between different COVID-19 waves and assessed factors associated with hospitalization, ICU admission and mortality by logistic regression. To further evaluate the dialysis at-risk population, we collected demographic and vaccination data between August 2021 and August 2022. RESULTS: Time of infection and SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data allowed for distinction of five separate waves of infection with different impact on the dialysis population: While in the initial four waves frequencies of hospitalization, necessity of critical care and mortality were around 60%, 10% and 20%, respectively. These events became rare during the large fifth wave, when Omicron had become the dominant variant. Although only 16.9% had to be hospitalized, this resulted in 29 hospital admissions, due to the high prevalence of COVID-19 during the Omicron era. Furthermore, we observed similar clinical outcomes with BA.4/5 as with BA.1/BA.2 Omicron sublineages. The proportion of previously infected increased simultaneously with the number of vaccination doses in our dialysis population. Vaccination at time of positivity and infection with an Omicron variant conferred protection against hospitalization and mortality in univariate analysis, but only infection with an Omicron variant remained a robust predictor for these outcomes in multivariable analysis. DISCUSSION: While a fourth of our at-risk population became infected during the Omicron wave, mortality was almost non-existent. Several concomitant factors have contributed to the decrease of COVID-19 severity in HD patients. This trend appears to be continued with BA.4/5, which was equally mild as BA.1 and BA.2 in our well vaccinated dialysis population."	"2296-2565

We compared the two groups' previous stability of MG and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients were comparable in terms of severity of the previous MG course (mean maximum myasthenia gravis Foundation of America-MGFA-Class III) and during SARS-CoV-2 infection (mean MGFA Class II). In non-vaccinated patients, the hospitalization and severe course percentages were 61.5%, while the mortality reached 30.8%. The hospitalization, severe course, and mortality percentages in vaccinated patients were 7.1%. In deceased, non-vaccinated patients, greater myasthenia severity in the past clinical history, but not at the time of infection, was observed. Similarly, older age at MG onset and at the time of infection correlated with a more severe COVID-19 course in non-vaccinated patients (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04), but not in the group of vaccinated patients. In summary, our data support a protective role of vaccination in myasthenic patients, even if anti-CD20 therapy might be associated with a poor immune response to vaccines."	"2075-1729

Switzerland/epidemiology"	"OBJECTIVES: To describe the burden of COVID-19 in Swiss long-term care facilities in 2020, to identify its influencing factors, and to assess vaccination rates among residents and healthcare workers at the end of the vaccine campaign in Switzerland in May 2021. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Long-term care facilities from two Swiss cantons (St. Gallen / Eastern Switzerland and Vaud / Western Switzerland). METHODS: We collected numbers of COVID-19 cases and related deaths and all-cause mortality for 2020, potential risk factors at the institutional level (e.g. size, infection prevention and control measures, and resident characteristics), and vaccination rates among residents and healthcare workers. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors associated with resident mortality in 2020. RESULTS: We enrolled 59 long-term care facilities with a median of 46 (interquartile range [IQR]: 33-69) occupied beds. In 2020, the median COVID-19 incidence was 40.2 (IQR: 0-108.6) per 100 occupied beds, with higher rates in VD (49.9%) than in SG (32.5%; p = 0.037). Overall, 22.7% of COVID-19 cases died, of which 24.8% were COVID-19-related deaths. In the univariate analysis, higher resident mortality was associated with COVID-19 rates among residents (p < 0.001) and healthcare workers (p = 0.002) and age (p = 0.013). Lower resident mortality was associated with the proportion of single rooms (p = 0.012), isolation of residents with COVID-19 in single rooms (p = 0.003), symptom screening of healthcare workers (p = 0.031), limiting the number of visits per day (p = 0.004), and pre-scheduling visits (p = 0.037). In the multivariate analysis, higher resident mortality was only associated with age (p = 0.03) and the COVID-19 rate among residents (p = 0.013). Among 2936 residents, 2042 (69.9%) received ≥1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine before 31 May 2021. Vaccine uptake among healthcare workers was 33.8%. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: COVID-19 burden was high but also highly variable in Swiss long-term care facilities. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among healthcare workers was a modifiable factor associated with increased resident mortality. Symptom screening of healthcare workers appeared to be an effective preventive strategy and should be included in routine infection prevention and control measures. Promoting COVID-19 vaccine uptake among healthcare workers should be a priority in Swiss long-term care facilities."	"1424-3997

A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital and Research Center, Karachi, Pakistan. A total of 1407 hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients were included from April 2021 to March 2022, of which 812 (57.71%) were males. Of the 1407, 378 (26.87%) patients were vaccinated while 1029 (73.13%) were unvaccinated. Of the vaccinated patients, 160 (42.32%) were partially vaccinated while 218 (57.68%) were fully vaccinated (vaccine breakthrough infection). Fewer unvaccinated COVID-19 patients survived compared to vaccinated patients (62.5% vs. 70%, RR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.82-0.96, p-value = 0.004). Despite there being more vaccinated patients above 60 years of age (60.05% vs. 47.13%), their risk of mortality was lower by 43% (OR = 0.578; CI = 0.4201 to 0.7980, p = 0.0009). On survival analysis, vaccinated patients had better 30-day survival compared to unvaccinated patients (p = 0.028). Moreover, comparing waves 3-5, unvaccinated patients of wave 4, which was driven by the delta variant, had the worst survival (51.8%, p ≤ 0.001) while vaccinated patients of wave 3 (driven by the alpha variant) had the best survival (71.6%)."

Public health"	"OBJECTIVES: While almost 60% of the world has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, the global distribution of vaccination has not been equitable. Only 4% of the population of low-income countries (LICs) has received a full primary vaccine series, compared with over 70% of the population of high-income nations. DESIGN: We used economic and epidemiological models, parameterised with public data on global vaccination and COVID-19 deaths, to estimate the potential benefits of scaling up vaccination programmes in LICs and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) in 2022 in the context of global spread of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV2. SETTING: Low-income and lower-middle-income nations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were expressed as number of avertable deaths through vaccination, costs of scale-up and cost per death averted. We conducted sensitivity analyses over a wide range of parameter estimates to account for uncertainty around key inputs. FINDINGS: Globally, universal vaccination in LIC/LMIC with three doses of an mRNA vaccine would result in an estimated 1.5 million COVID-19 deaths averted with a total estimated cost of US$61 billion and an estimated cost-per-COVID-19 death averted of US$40 800 (sensitivity analysis range: US$7400-US$81 500). Lower estimated infection fatality ratios, higher cost-per-dose and lower vaccine effectiveness or uptake lead to higher cost-per-death averted estimates in the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Scaling up COVID-19 global vaccination would avert millions of COVID-19 deaths and represents a reasonable investment in the context of the value of a statistical life. Given the magnitude of expected mortality facing LIC/LMIC without vaccination, this effort should be an urgent priority."	"2044-6055

Inactivated vaccine"	"BACKGROUND: Vaccines are urgently needed to handle the morbidity and mortality of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. The inactivated vaccine is widely used in Indonesia's national immunization program due to its eligibility of stock, easier to transport, and considered to be more established than newer platforms. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the safety profile of the inactivated vaccine and analyze the safety profile between adults and the elderly. METHODS: A prospective analytical study was conducted to evaluate the safety profile of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine among healthy adults aged ≥ 18 years from September 2nd to December 28th, 2021, at ten primary health centers from 5 districts in Jakarta, Indonesia. The participants were instructed to record the symptoms after inactivated COVID-19 vaccine injection in the diary card for 28 days. Chi-square tests were carried out to analyze the relationship between the adverse event following immunization (AEFI) in adults and elderly groups. RESULTS: Four of 1113 participants were not included in this study due to the lack of follow-up. Out of 1109 participants, there were 1044 adults (18-59 years) and 65 elderly (>59 years). There were no serious AEFI cases reported. Most AEFI cases were mild to moderate and resolved after several days of injection. Local pain, myalgia and fatigue were the most frequent adverse events reported. We found that there was no correlation between the adults and elderly age group with the incidence of AEFI (p = 0.924) for local reactions (p = 0.181) and most of the systemic reactions (p = 0.629). However, there is an increased risk of fever in the elderly group compared to the adult group (OR 4.046, 95 % CI 1.794-9.124, p = 0.003) following immunization. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine is safe, considering that all symptoms experienced were mild to moderate and resolved entirely."	"2590-1362

Vaccine"	"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has killed over 6 million people worldwide, making it the worst global health disaster since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Experts have worked to establish the source, track and analyse the disease, and produce treatment and preventative guidelines. Inactivated vaccines have little evidence of efficacy compared to mRNA and adenoviral vector vaccines; however, three doses of both mRNA and inactivated vaccines appear to provide significant and lasting protection against severe disease and mortality. This study examines inactivated vaccine effectiveness data by disease status, age, gender, primary immunisation, booster doses, and SARS-CoV2 virus types. METHODS: We conducted a quantitative epidemiological meta-analysis study to assess the vaccine effectiveness of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines. Data extraction was performed on the selected studies, and data analysis was conducted using a random-effects model to determine consolidated assessments of vaccine effectiveness. Subgroup analyses were conducted for gender, age, disease level, and vaccine status, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The overall effect size of inactivated COVID-19 vaccinations was statistically significant (p-value<0.05), suggesting that complete vaccination should be the primary method of vaccination. Partial vaccination was associated with lower levels of vaccine effectiveness (70.18 95% CI 57.33-83.02) than complete vaccination (79.52 95% CI 67.88-91.71)) and booster vaccination (84.22 95% CI 74.34-94.10), suggesting that it is essential to finish the recommended vaccine series and receive booster doses. Fig.-3: Partially vaccinated individuals showed a vaccine effect size of 70.18 (95% CI 57.33-83.02), indicating that the vaccine was moderately effective in preventing COVID-19 among this group. Fully vaccinated individuals showed a vaccine effect size of 79.52 (95% CI 67.88-91.71), indicating a higher level of vaccine effectiveness. Finally, booster-vaccinated individuals showed a vaccine effect size of 84.22 (95% CI 74.34-94.10), indicating the highest level of vaccine effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Inactivated COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing COVID-19, and complete vaccination and booster vaccination are associated with higher levels of vaccine effectiveness compared to partial vaccination. These findings highlight the importance of completing the recommended vaccine series and receiving booster doses to provide greater protection against COVID-19."	"1876-035x

We examined how risks of hospitalisation for a wide range of vaccine-preventable conditions varied by age and sex among mental health (MH) service users. METHODS: Linked population data from New South Wales (NSW), Australia were used to identify vaccine-preventable hospitalisations (VPH) for 19 conditions from 2015 to 2020. Adult MH service users (n = 418 915) were compared to other NSW residents using incidence rates standardised for age, sex and socioeconomic status. Secondary analyses examined admissions for COVID-19 to September 2021. RESULTS: We identified 94 180 VPH of which 41% were influenza, 33% hepatitis B and 10% herpes zoster. MH service users had more VPH admissions [adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 3.2, 95% CI 3.1-3.3]. Relative risks were highest for hepatitis (aIRR 4.4, 95% CI 4.3-4.6), but elevated for all conditions including COVID-19 (aIRR 2.0, 95% CI 1.9-2.2). MH service users had a mean age of 9 years younger than other NSW residents at first VPH admission, with the largest age gap for vaccine-preventable pneumonias (11-13 years younger). The highest relative risk of VPH was among MH service users aged 45-65. CONCLUSIONS: MH service users have increased risk of hospitalisation for many vaccine-preventable conditions. This may be due to reduced vaccination rates, more severe illness requiring hospitalisation, greater exposure to infectious conditions or other factors. People living with mental illness should be prioritised in vaccination strategies."	"1469-8978

The incidence of myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination has been increasing and growing public concern; however, little is known about it. This study aimed to systematically review myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination. We included studies containing individual patient data of myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination published between January 1, 2020 and September 7, 2022 and excluded review articles. Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisals were used for risk of bias assessment. Descriptive and analytic statistics were performed. A total of 121 reports and 43 case series from five databases were included. We identified 396 published cases of myocarditis and observed that the majority of cases was male patients, happened following the second dose of mRNA vaccine administration, and experienced chest pain as a symptom. Previous COVID-19 infection was significantly associated (p < 0.01; OR, 5.74; 95% CI, 2.42-13.64) with the risk of myocarditis following the administration of the first dose, indicating that its primary mechanism is immune-mediated. Moreover, 63 histopathology examinations were dominated by non-infective subtypes. Electrocardiography and cardiac marker combination is a sensitive screening modality. However, cardiac magnetic resonance is a significant noninvasive examination to confirm myocarditis. Endomyocardial biopsy may be considered in confusing and severe cases. Myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination is relatively benign, with a median length of hospitalization of 5 days, intensive care unit admission of <12%, and mortality of <2%. The majority was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, and steroids. Surprisingly, deceased cases had characteristics of being female, older age, non-chest pain symptoms, first-dose vaccination, left ventricular ejection fraction of <30%, fulminant myocarditis, and eosinophil infiltrate histopathology."

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on epidemiological data released by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. METHODS: An observational study was performed using epidemiological data available at OpenDataSUS. The primary outcome was death-the study period comprised December 29, 2019, to April 6, 2023. The odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval (OR; 95% CI) was calculated to evaluate the association between the epidemiological markers, including the vaccination status against influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the outcome using a multivariable analysis. RESULTS: The study comprised 791,891 hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. In the study, male sex, older age, living in rural areas, and race (Black and Indigenous peoples), as well as the presence of clinical signs, comorbidities (except the presence of asthma, which was protective), need for intensive care unit, and invasive mechanical ventilation, were associated with a higher chance of death; the vaccination was protective. Among patients with COVID-19, the individuals who received vaccination against influenza [N = 138,564; OR = 0.754 (95% CI = 0.742-0.766)], SARS-CoV-2 [N = 114,628; OR = 0.630 (95% CI = 0.620-0.641)], or both vaccines [N = 55,616; OR = 0.544 (95% CI = 0.531-0.556)], when compared to the individuals who received no vaccination (N = 483,083), had a lower chance of death. CONCLUSIONS: The flu vaccination might be responsible for decreased mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Brazil."	"1476-5616

This retrospective cohort study describes the correlation between antispike antibodies and outcomes of hospitalized, breakthrough cases during the delta variant surge. METHODS: All patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction hospitalized at Mayo Clinic Florida from 19 June 2021 to 11 November 2021 were considered for analysis. Cases were analyzed by vaccination status. Breakthrough cases were then analyzed by low and high antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, with a cut-off value of ≥132 U/ml. Outcomes included hospital length of stay (LOS), need for intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, and mortality. We used 1:1 nearest neighbor propensity score matching without replacement to assess for confounders. RESULTS: Among 627 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, vaccine breakthrough cases were older with more comorbidities compared to unvaccinated. After propensity score matching, the unvaccinated patients had higher mortality (27 [28.4%] vs. 12 [12.6%], p = 0.002) and LOS (7 [1.0-57.0] vs. 5 [1.0-31.0] days, p = 0.011). In breakthrough cases, low-titer patients were more likely to be solid organ transplant recipients (16 [34.0%] vs. 9 [12.3%], p = 0.006), with higher need for ICU care (24 [51.1%] vs. 22 [11.0%], p = 0.034), longer hospital LOS (median 6 vs. 5 days, p = 0.013), and higher mortality (10 [21.3%] vs. 5 [6.8%], p = 0.025) than high-titer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized breakthrough cases were more likely to have underlying risk factors than unvaccinated patients. Low-spike antibody titers may serve as an indicator for poor prognosis in breakthrough cases admitted to the hospital."	"1365-2796

Transplant Recipients"	"BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 due to their immunosuppressed state and reduced immunogenicity from COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. This investigation examined the association between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination status and mortality among SOT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS & FINDINGS: A retrospective, registry-based chart review was conducted investigating COVID-19 mortality among immunosuppressed solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients in a large metropolitan healthcare system in Houston, Texas, USA. Electronic health record data was collected from consecutive SOT recipients who received a diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 test between March 1, 2020, and October 1, 2021. The primary exposure was COVID-19 vaccination status at time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients were considered 'fully vaccinated' at fourteen days after completing their vaccine course. COVID-19 mortality within 60 days and intensive care unit admission within 30 days were primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. Among 646 SOT recipients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at Houston Methodist Hospital between March 2020, and October 2021, 70 (10.8%) expired from COVID-19 within 60 days. Transplanted organs included 63 (9.8%) heart, 355 (55.0%) kidney, 108 (16.7%) liver, 70 (10.8%) lung, and 50 (7.7%) multi-organ. Increasing age was a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, while vaccination within 180 days of COVID-19 diagnosis was protective in Cox proportional hazard models with hazard ratio 1.04 (95% CI: 1.01-1.06) and 0.31 (0.11-0.90), respectively). These findings were confirmed in the propensity score matched cohort between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation found COVID-19 mortality may be significantly reduced among immunosuppressed SOT recipients within 6 months following vaccination. These findings can inform vaccination policies targeting immunosuppressed populations worldwide."	"1932-6203

Vaccination"	"BACKGROUND: In kidney patients COVID-19 is associated with severely increased morbidity and mortality. A comprehensive comparison of the immunogenicity, tolerability, and safety of COVID-19 vaccination in different cohorts of kidney patients and a control cohort is lacking. METHODS: This investigator driven, prospective, controlled multicenter study included 162 participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages G4/5 (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2), 159 participants on dialysis, 288 kidney transplant recipients, and 191 controls. Participants received 2 doses of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna). The primary endpoint was seroconversion. RESULTS: Transplant recipients had a significantly lower seroconversion rate when compared with controls (56.9% versus 100%, P < 0.001), with especially mycophenolic acid, but also, higher age, lower lymphocyte concentration, lower eGFR, and shorter time after transplantation being associated with nonresponder state. Transplant recipients also showed significantly lower titers of neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses when compared with controls. Although a high seroconversion rate was observed for participants with CKD G4/5 (100%) and on dialysis (99.4%), mean antibody concentrations in the CKD G4/5 cohort and dialysis cohort were lower than in controls (2405 [interquartile interval 1287-4524] and 1650 [698-3024] versus 3186 [1896-4911] BAU/mL, P = 0.06 and P < 0.001, respectively). Dialysis patients and especially kidney transplant recipients experienced less systemic vaccination related adverse events. No specific safety issues were noted. CONCLUSIONS: The immune response following vaccination in patients with CKD G4/5 and on dialysis is almost comparable to controls. In contrast, kidney transplant recipients have a poor response. In this latter, patient group development of alternative vaccination strategies are warranted."	"1534-6080

The aim of this study was to assess potential environmental and individual factors associated to COVID-19 mortality in children and adolescents in Mexico. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analysed the official data of 131,001 children under 10 years of age and adolescents between 10 and 19 years of age with COVID-19 disease, in Mexico. Participants were diagnosticated between March 2020 and June 13, 2021. The environmental variables such as malnutrition, vaccination coverage and social lag index were evaluated at the state level. Multilevel models were fitted to evaluate the association between environmental and individual factors and COVID-19 mortality. FINDINGS: A total of 773 (0.6%) children and adolescents died due to COVID-19. Younger age (OR = 0.878, 95%CI: 0.869-0.888), diabetes (OR = 3.898, 95%CI: 2.596-5.851), immunosuppression (OR = 5.410, 95%CI: 4.088-7.158), obesity (OR = 1.876, 95%CI: 1.397-2.521), hypertension (OR = 1.906, 95%CI: 1.239-2.932), cardiovascular disease (OR = 2.288, 95%CI: 1.482-3.531), and chronic kidney disease (OR = 13.250, 95%CI: 9.066-19.350) were associated with mortality. COVID-19 mortality was directly associated with social lag index and malnutrition (OR(very high) = 2.939, 95%CI: 1.111-7.775, and OR = 1.390, 95%CI: 1.073-1.802, respectively), and inversely associated with population density (OR = 0.374, 95%CI: 0.204-0.688). Finally, children and adolescents living in areas with a higher percentage of people with incomplete education (OR = 1.045, 95%CI: 1.011-1.081), of children of school age of 6-14 years who do not attend school (OR = 1.266, 95%CI: 1.032-1.554), and of illiterate population aged 15 and over (OR = 1.086, 95%CI: 0.999-1.179) were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality. INTERPRETATION: Malnutrition, social lag index and population density are key factors to understand COVID-19 mortality in children and adolescents. Also, age and pre-existing comorbidities were also associated with worse COVID-19 prognosis. FUNDING: No funding was secured for this study."	"2667-193x

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with and without TTS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from an international registry of consecutive patients with CVST within 28 days of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination included between March 29 and June 18, 2021, from 81 hospitals in 19 countries. For reference, data from patients with CVST between 2015 and 2018 were derived from an existing international registry. Clinical characteristics and mortality rate were described for adults with (1) CVST in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, (2) CVST after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination not fulling criteria for TTS, and (3) CVST unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. EXPOSURES: Patients were classified as having TTS if they had new-onset thrombocytopenia without recent exposure to heparin, in accordance with the Brighton Collaboration interim criteria. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical characteristics and mortality rate. RESULTS: Of 116 patients with postvaccination CVST, 78 (67.2%) had TTS, of whom 76 had been vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCov-19; 38 (32.8%) had no indication of TTS. The control group included 207 patients with CVST before the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 63 of 78 (81%), 30 of 38 (79%), and 145 of 207 (70.0%) patients, respectively, were female, and the mean (SD) age was 45 (14), 55 (20), and 42 (16) years, respectively. Concomitant thromboembolism occurred in 25 of 70 patients (36%) in the TTS group, 2 of 35 (6%) in the no TTS group, and 10 of 206 (4.9%) in the control group, and in-hospital mortality rates were 47% (36 of 76; 95% CI, 37-58), 5% (2 of 37; 95% CI, 1-18), and 3.9% (8 of 207; 95% CI, 2.0-7.4), respectively. The mortality rate was 61% (14 of 23) among patients in the TTS group diagnosed before the condition garnered attention in the scientific community and 42% (22 of 53) among patients diagnosed later. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients with CVST, a distinct clinical profile and high mortality rate was observed in patients meeting criteria for TTS after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination."

In the present manuscript, we aim to assess COVID-19-attributed mortality after the prevalence of new variants of the virus (Delta and Omicron viral strains) and to evaluate the vaccination effect. Methods: All patients that were hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection in the Respiratory Department of a tertiary referral center in central Greece between 1st of June 2021 and 1st of February 2022 were included in the present study. Results: 760 consecutive patients were included in the study; 89 (11.7%) were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 and 220 (38.7%) patients were fully vaccinated. In logistic regression, increased age (aOR = 1.12, p < 0.001), male gender (aOR = 2.29, p = 0.013) and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus (aOR = 0.2, p < 0.001) were associated with mortality attributed to COVID-19 with a statistically significant association. Moreover, increased age (aOR = 1.09, p < 0.001), male gender (aOR = 1.92, p = 0.025) and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus (aOR = 0.25, p < 0.001) were statistically significantly associated with clinical severity of COVID-19 infection. However, when comparing the length of hospitalization between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, the difference was not statistically significant between the two groups (p = 0.138). Conclusions: Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus had a protective effect in terms of mortality and clinical severity of COVID-19 during the fourth wave of the pandemic in Central Greece. The national vaccination policy has to focus on vulnerable populations that are expected to benefit the most from the vaccine’s protection."	"2075-4426

neurological adverse events"	"OBJECTIVE: In this Italian population-based study, we aimed to evaluate the neurological complications after the first and/or second dose of COVID-19 vaccines and factors potentially associated with these adverse effects. METHODS: Our study included adults aged 18 years and older who received two vaccine doses in the vaccination hub of Novegro (Milan, Lombardy) between 7 and 16 July 2021. The NEURO-COVAX questionnaire was able to capture the neurological events, onset and duration. That data that were digitized centrally by the Lombardy region were used to match the demographic/clinical characteristics and identify a vulnerability profile. Associations between vaccine lines and the development of complications were assessed. Digital healthcare system matching was also performed to evaluate severe neurological complications (Guillain-Barrè syndrome, Bell's palsy, transverse myelitis, encephalitis) and the incidence of hospital admissions and/or the mortality rate after two doses of the vaccines. RESULTS: The NEURO-COVAX-cohort included 19.108 vaccinated people: 15.368 with BNT162b2, 2077 with mRNA-1273, 1651 with ChAdOx1nCov-19, and 12 with Ad26.COV2.S who were subsequently excluded. Approximately 31.2% of our sample developed post-vaccination neurological complications, particularly with ChAdOx1nCov-19. A vulnerable clinical profile emerged, where over 40% of the symptomatic people showed comorbidities in their clinical histories. Defining the neurological risk profile, we found an increased risk for ChAdOx1nCov-19 of tremors (vs. BNT162b2, OR: 5.12, 95% CI: 3.51-7.48); insomnia (vs. mRNA-1273, OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.02-3.39); muscle spasms (vs. BNT162b2, OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.08-2.46); and headaches (vs. BNT162b2, OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 0.96-1.57). For mRNA-1273, there were increased risks of parethesia (vs. ChAdOx1nCov-19, OR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.48-3.79); vertigo (vs. ChAdOx1nCov-19, OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.20-2.35); diplopia (vs. ChAdOx1nCov-19, OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 0.67-3.57); and sleepiness (vs. ChAdOx1nCov-19, OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.98-1.67). In the period that ranged from March to August 2021, no one was hospitalized and/or died of severe complications related to COVID-19 vaccinations. DISCUSSION: This study estimates the prevalence and risk for neurological complications potentially associated with COVID-19 vaccines, thus improving the vaccination guidelines and loading in future personalized preventive medicine."

Safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 have been introduced to the public and have been shown to reduce the severity of the disease and related mortality rates. COVID-19 vaccination was first introduced in Lebanon in mid-February 2021. In this study, we analyzed the effectiveness of vaccination against COVID-19-related hospitalization during the Delta wave at a major referral center in Lebanon. Methods This patient-population study was conducted on patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between July 1, 2021, and September 30, 2021, at the Rafik Hariri University Hospital (RHUH) in Beirut, Lebanon. Data were collected directly from the patients or from digitized records and included demographic characteristics (age, sex, and comorbidities), vaccination status, oxygen requirement, and outcomes. National vaccination data were collected from the daily bulletin provided by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. The data collected were analyzed using SPSS Statistics Version 19.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results A total of 289 patients were included in the study, of whom 90.3% were unvaccinated and 9.7% were vaccinated with at least one dose of a two-dose regimen. Only 4.5% of the 289 patients were fully vaccinated. Among those fully or partially vaccinated, the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalization was shorter but the hospital stay was longer compared to the unvaccinated group. The mortality rate was higher in the unvaccinated group (25.7%) compared to 14.3% among the vaccinated. The vaccine effectiveness compared to the national vaccination rate (22.5% in the population after the first and second dose) was 71.71% and 83.78% respectively. Conclusion The findings of this study highlight the fact that complete/partial vaccination against COVID-19 was highly protective against severe disease and hospitalization during the period with a predominance of the Delta variant in Lebanon."

Among viral pathogens, coronaviruses have been described to play a role. This study aims to investigate the role of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination on exacerbation reduction in patients with COPD. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COPD prior to the study date were considered the study population. Exacerbations of COPD before and after the COVID-19 vaccination were recorded. Patients with influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccination were excluded from the study due to their known role in reducing exacerbations of COPD. RESULTS: The study included 152 patients with a mean age of 67.5 ± 9.7 years. Most patients were classified under Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages 2 and 3. In fully vaccinated patients, COPD exacerbation was observed to be higher than in those without full vaccination (70.5% vs. 55.3%, respectively). Total risk status and vaccination status, however, were seen to be in a positive correlation, with higher risk and complete vaccination status presenting with a higher count of COPD exacerbation. CONCLUSION: Although it is known that the administration of COVID-19 vaccines in patients in risk groups reduces the risk of disease, there is no study showing a positive effect on COPD exacerbations alone. In our study, it was observed that only the COVID-19 vaccine was ineffective in attacks without influenza and pneumococcal vaccines."	"2168-8184

Little is known about COVID-19 disease severity in SOTR with COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections. METHODS: Between 4/7/21 and 6/21/21, we requested case reports via the Emerging Infections Network (EIN) listserv of SARS-CoV-2 infection following COVID-19 vaccination in SOTR. Online data collection included patient demographics, dates of COVID-19 vaccine administration, and clinical data related to COVID-19. We performed a descriptive analysis of patient factors and evaluated variables contributing to critical disease or need for hospitalization. RESULTS: Sixty-six cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination in SOTR were collected. COVID-19 occurred after the second vaccine dose in 52 (78.8%) cases, of which 43 (82.7%) occurred ≥14 days post-vaccination. There were six deaths, three occurring in fully vaccinated individuals (7.0%, n = 3/43). There was no difference in the percentage of patients who recovered from COVID-19 (70.7% vs. 72.2%, p = .90) among fully and partially vaccinated individuals. We did not identify any differences in hospitalization (60.5% vs. 55.6%, p = .72) or critical disease (20.9% vs. 33.3%, p = .30) among those who were fully versus partially vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: SOTR vaccinated against COVID-19 can still develop severe, and even critical, COVID-19 disease. Two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may be insufficient to protect against severe disease and mortality in SOTR. Future studies to define correlates of protection in SOTR are needed."	"1399-3062

Pandemic preparedness"	"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infections still have a significant impact on the global population. The existing vaccinations have contributed to reducing the severe disease courses, decreasing hospitalisations, and lowering the mortality rate. However, due to the variability of COVID-19 symptoms, the emergence of new variants and the uneven global distribution of vaccines there is still a great need for new therapy options. One promising approach is provided by host-directed therapies. We assessed here the efficacy and safety of MP1032, a host-directed anti-viral/anti-inflammatory drug in hospitalised patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. METHODS: In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase IIa study, patients were randomised 2:1 to receive either 300 mg MP032 bid + Standard-of-Care (SoC) or placebo bid + SoC for 28 days. Eligible patients were ≥18 years old, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and had moderate to severe COVID-19 symptoms. The study spanned 20 sites in six countries (Bulgaria, France, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Spain), assessing disease progression according the NIAID scale as the primary outcome on day 14. Secondary objectives included disease progression (day 28), disease resolution (days 14 and 28), mortality rate, COVID-19 related parameters and safety. Exposure-response analyses were performed, linking MP1032 to COVID-19 biomarkers (eGFR, D-dimer). FINDINGS: 132 patients were enrolled to receive MP1032 + SoC (n = 87) or placebo + SoC (n = 45). The patients were all white or Caucasian with a mean (median) age of 60.5 (63) years. Overall, only 10 patients were vaccinated, 5 in each group. No significant risk difference of disease progression could be detected between groups on both day 14 (9.8% MP1032 vs. 11.6% placebo) and day 28 with MH common risk differences of -0.276% (95% CI, -11.634 to 11.081; p = 0.962) and 1.722% (95% CI, -4.576 to 8.019; p = 0.592), respectively.The treatment with MP1032 + SoC was safe and well-tolerated. Overall, 182 TEAEs including 10 SAEs were reported in 53.5% (46/86) of patients of the verum group and in 57.8% (26/45) of patients of the placebo group; the SAEs occurred in 5.8% (5/86) and 6.7% (3/45) of verum and placebo patients, respectively. None of the SAEs was considered as related. INTERPRETATION: Despite the study's limitation in size and the variation in concurrent SoCs, these findings warrant further investigation of MP1032 as a host-directed anti-viral drug candidate. FUNDING: The study was funded by the COVID-19 Horizon Europe work programme and MetrioPharm AG."	"2666-7762

Mathematical model"	"IMPORTANCE: An effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 will reduce morbidity and mortality and allow substantial relaxation of physical distancing policies. However, the ability of a vaccine to prevent infection or disease depends critically on protecting older individuals, who are at highest risk of severe disease. OBJECTIVE: We quantitatively estimated the relative benefits of COVID-19 vaccines, in terms of preventing infection and death, with a particular focus on effectiveness in elderly people. DESIGN: We applied compartmental mathematical modelling to determine the relative effects of vaccines that block infection and onward transmission, and those that prevent severe disease. We assumed that vaccines showing high efficacy in adults would be deployed, and examined the effects of lower vaccine efficacy among the elderly population. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Our mathematical model was calibrated to simulate the course of an epidemic among the entire population of British Columbia, Canada. Within our model, the population was structured by age and levels of contact. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): We assessed the effectiveness of possible vaccines in terms of the predicted number of infections within the entire population, and deaths among people aged 65 years and over. RESULTS: In order to reduce the overall rate of infections in the population, high rates of deployment to all age groups will be critical. However, to substantially reduce mortality among people aged 65 years and over, a vaccine must directly protect a high proportion of people in that group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Effective vaccines deployed to a large fraction of the population are projected to substantially reduce infection in an otherwise susceptible population. However, even if transmission were blocked highly effectively by vaccination of children and younger adults, overall mortality would not be substantially reduced unless the vaccine is also directly protective in elderly people. We strongly recommend: (i) the inclusion of people aged 65 years and over in future trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidates; (ii) careful monitoring of vaccine efficacy in older age groups following vaccination."

Evaluating effectiveness of BNT162b2 in a general population has been made possible after the implementation of a nation-wide vaccination program in Israel. This retrospective cohort study was carried out in Maccabi HealthCare services, Israel among 1.6 million members aged 16 and over. The population was divided into those who were at least seven days post- second vaccination and those who had not been vaccinated. Number of days till the end of the study or Covid-19 infection, Covid-19-related hospitalization and mortality was calculated for each participant between 18.1.2021 to 25.4.2021. Participants who had reached day eight after second vaccination during the study period could contribute days to both groups. Vaccine efficacy (VE) was calculated using a conditional Poisson model, controlling for age group, gender, hypertension, diabetes and obesity, fitted within clusters defined by geographical statistical area and calendar week. BNT162b2 was found effective for the total population group for infection, hospitalization and mortality, with adjusted VE of 93·0% (CI:92·6-93·4%), 93·4% (CI:91·9-94·7%) and 91·1% (CI:86·5-94·1%) respectively. VE for infection was lower for participants aged 75 and over, and for those with hypertension, diabetes and obesity. This study strengthens the evidence that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination is effective in preventing infection, hospitalization and mortality."	"1096-0260

A retrospective-archive study was conducted from February 27th 2020 to October 16th, 2021. Data were obtained from the Israeli Ministry of Health's open COVID 19 database, including PCR-confirmed cases, number hospitalized - including severe cases, death rate, all by age and vaccination status, case fatality rate and changing effectiveness of the vaccine. After three COVID waves, confirmed cases rose from under 30 new daily cases in mid-June to a high of 11,000 in early September 2021. Severe hospitalized cases and death rates were lower than in previous waves and largely restricted to those not fully vaccinated. In the first three months of the vaccination campaign, non-vaccinated population demonstrated much higher morbidity rates. Four months after vaccination began, this gap was attenuated, with low rates of infection and hospitalization in all groups. The gap was regained following uptake of the third vaccine. Data from the fourth wave show reduced hospitalizations and mortality compared to previous waves and suggest that this may be related to high vaccine coverage. These trends suggest that countries with high vaccination might adopt a more permissive approach towards COVID even in the face of new variants."	"1096-0260

However, their effectiveness in preventing infection, hospitalization, and COVID-associated mortality in Jordan has yet to be evaluated. The purpose of this observational study was to evaluate the relative effectiveness of three approved vaccines against COVID-19 in a sample of the Jordanian population. The study was conducted between July 2021 and 2022 in a sample of adult patients presenting to hospitals across Jordan and receiving one of the three vaccines - Pfizer (BNT162b2), Astra Zeneca (ChAdOx1-S), or Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV). Data were collected to measure the rates of infection without hospitalization, infection with hospitalization, and death. The sample included patients with one of the following chronic conditions: cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, or diabetes. Primary data were obtained from patients' health records. The sample included 6132 adults from Jordan, with a mean age 52 ± 17 years. The rates of death in patients receiving two doses of any vaccine ranged between 0.175 and 2.77%, compared with 0.69-13.53% in patients receiving only one dose. The rates of hospitalization were 6-7.97% with two doses, compared to 7.98-25.13% with one dose. The rates of infection without hospitalization were significantly higher in the two-dose group (6-25.1%) compared with those who had received only one dose of any COVID-19 vaccine (0.69-10.61%). In conclusion, receiving two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine was associated with lower odds of mortality and hospitalization and higher odds of infection. More research is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2."	"1096-1208

The objective of this study was to assess the frequency and the clinical characteristics of severe breakthrough COVID-19 cases recorded in 10 Polish healthcare units between 1 June and 31 December 2021, a period during which a rapid surge in the share of B.1.617.2 infections was seen, while a significant number of populations were already fully vaccinated. Overall, 723 individuals who completed the initial vaccination regime (fully vaccinated group) and an additional 18 who received a booster dose were identified—together, they represented 20.8% of all the COVID-19 patients hospitalized during the same period in the same healthcare institutions (0.5% in the case of a group that received a booster dose). Although laboratory and clinical parameters did not differ between both groups, patients who received a booster tended to have lower CRP, IL-6, PCT, and d-dimer levels and they required oxygen therapy less frequently. The most common early COVID-19 symptoms in the studied group were fatigue, cough, fever (>38 °C), and dyspnea. Individuals with no detectable anti-spike IgG antibodies constituted 13%; the odds of being a humoral non-responder to the vaccine were increased in patients aged >70 years. Fully vaccinated patients hospitalized after more than 180 days from the last vaccine dose were significantly older and they were predominantly represented by individuals over 70 years and with comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease. Contrary to mRNA vaccines, most patients vaccinated with adenoviral vector vaccines were infected within six months. A total of 102 fatal cases (14% of all deaths among vaccinated individuals; 0.7% in the case of a group that received a booster dose) were recorded, representing 17.6% of all the COVID-19 fatalities recorded in June−December 2021 in the considered healthcare units. The odds of death were significantly increased in men, individuals aged >70 years, patients with comorbidities, and those identified as humoral non-responders to vaccination; in fully vaccinated patients the odds were also increased when the second vaccine dose was given >180 days before the first COVID-19 symptoms. The mortality rate in immunocompromised subjects was 19%. The results indicate that compared to vaccinated individuals, severe COVID-19 and deaths in the unvaccinated group were significantly more prevalent during the B.1.617.2-dominated wave in Poland; and, it highlight the protective role of a booster dose, particularly for more vulnerable individuals."

Coronavirus has mutated into a triple-mutated virus, rendering it deadlier than before. It spreads quickly from person to person by contact and nasal or pharyngeal droplets. The COVID-19 database 'Our World in Data' was analyzed from February 24, 2020, to September 26, 2021, and predictions on the COVID positives and their mortality rate were made. Factors such as Vaccine data for the First and Second Dose vaccinated individuals and COVID positives that influence the fluctuations in the COVID-19 death ratio were investigated and linear regression analysis was performed. Based on vaccination doses (partial or complete vaccinated), models are created to estimate the number of patients who die from COVID infection. The estimation of variance in the datasets was investigated using Karl Pearson's coefficient. For COVID-19 cases and vaccination doses, a quartic polynomial regression model was also created. This predictor model helps to predict the number of deaths due to COVID-19 and determine the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection based on the number of vaccine doses received. SVM was used to analyze the efficacy of models generated."	"2235-2988

DESIGN: descriptive study of vaccine adherence; predictive study of the factors associated with vaccine adherence, efficacy of vaccination in terms of hospitalization and mortality, and factors that increase the risk of hospital admission following full vaccination. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: population-based study with subjects aged >18 years eligible for vaccination (N. 2,981,997). An information system obtained by integrating various administrative healthcare sources made it possible to analyse socioeconomic characteristics, COVID-19 related hospitalizations, and general mortality in subjects eligible for vaccination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: full vaccination (2 doses); COVID-19-related hospitalizations, COVID-19-related hospitalizations occurring more than 15 days after the second dose, general mortality. RESULTS: in the first nine months of the vaccination campaign, 74.7% of the subjects (N. 2,228,915) was fully vaccinated, whereas 15.6% (N. 465,829) did not even receive one dose. Women have a lower probability of getting vaccinated than men; the 50-59 years and 70+ years age groups emerge as the most problematic to reach, while the younger one (<40) is the most adherent. A social gradient emerged, with residents of more disadvantaged areas progressively less incline to get vaccinated than those living in more affluent areas. Adherence is greater in Italian citizenship and is likely to increase with an increase in the number of chronic conditions. Hospitalizations amounted to 1.22% (N. 5,672) in the unvaccinated population compared to 0.05% (N. 1,013) in the vaccinated population; general mortality was 4.51% (N. 15,198) in the unvaccinated population against 0.32% (N. 8.733) in the vaccinated population. Sociodemographic factors and the presence of previous health conditions are important predictors of hospitalization outcomes even within the fully vaccinated population. Specifically, the highest hazard ratios are found in subjects with heart failure (HR 2.15; 95%CI 1.83-2.53), in immunocompromised patients (HR 2.02; 95%CI 1.52-2.69), and in transplant recipients (HR 1.92; 95%CI 1.10-3.33). CONCLUSIONS: vaccination campaign adherence is affected by the sociodemographic characteristics of the population and is a determining factor in preventing hospitalizations for COVID-19 and death. The persistent higher risk of hospitalization in chronic subjects following the second dose emphasizes the need to direct booster doses to the more vulnerable. Information systems proved to be effective monitoring tools in the absence of specific trials."	"Russo, Antonio Giampiero

In the winter of 2021, a new particularly infectious variant caused the urgent need to increase the coverage of the booster dose. OBJECTIVES: to present, using real data, an evaluation of the efficacy of the booster dose in reducing the severe disease of SARS-CoV-2 infection in terms of hospital admissions, intensive care and death from all causes. DESIGN: descriptive study of vaccine adherence; associative study of the factors linked with adherence of vaccination and COVID-19 symptoms; associative study of vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission and mortality. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: population-based study in the Milan and Lodi provinces (Lombardy Region, Northern Italy) with subjects aged >=19 years alive at 01.10.2021, not residing in a nursery home, followed up to 31.12.2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: COVID-19 symptoms, hospitalization for COVID-19, intensive care hospitalization, and all-cause mortality in the period 01.10.2021-31.12.2021. RESULTS: the cohort included 2,936,193 patients at 01.10.2021: at the end of the follow-up period (31.12.2021), 378,616 (12.9%) had no vaccine, 128,879 (4.3%) had only 1 dose, 412,227 (14.0%) had a 2nd dose given since less than 4 months, 725. 806 (25%) had a 2nd dose given since 4-7 months, 74,152 (2.5%) had a 2nd dose given since 7+ months, 62,614 (2.1%) had a 2nd dose and have had the disease, and 1,153,899 (39.3%) received the booster. In the study period (01.10.2021-31.12.2021), characterized by a very high prevalence of the omicron variant, 121,620 cases (antigenic/molecular buffer positive), 3,661 hospitalizations for COVID-19, 162 ICU hospitalizations, and 7,508 deaths from all causes were identified. Compared to unvaccinated people, subjects who had the booster dose had half the risk of being symptomatic, in particular for asthenia, muscle pain, and dyspnoea which are the most commons COVID-19 symptoms. In comparison with the subjects who had the booster dose, the unvaccinated had a 10-fold risk of hospitalization for COVID-19, a 9-fold risk of intensive care, and a 3-fold risk of dying. CONCLUSIONS: this work highlights the vaccination efficacy in reducing serious adverse events for those who undergo the booster and the need to implement specific engagement policies to bring to a booster those who had taken the second dose since the longest time."

In autumn 2021-winter 2022, the influenza epidemic had a delayed onset compared to pre-COVID-19 years and lower incidence rates than in the pre-pandemic period. The SARS-CoV-2 and influenza vaccination campaign overlapped in 2021-2022. OBJECTIVES: to evaluate in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated cohort the effect of different timing of influenza vaccination on hospitalisations for COVID-19 and overall mortality. DESIGN: prospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: subjects aged 65 years or older who were administered the first booster dose of SARS-COV-2 vaccine between 01.10.2021 and 01.03.2022. Based on the date of influenza vaccination, subjects were divided into the following 4 different mutually exclusive groups: 1. two vaccinations in the same vaccination session; 2. influenza vaccination following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination; 3. influenza vaccination preceding SARS-CoV-2 vaccination; 4. no influenza vaccination. Using Cox regression models, hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of hospitalisation and death were estimated for the influenza-vaccinated subjects compared to influenza-unvaccinated subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ordinary hospital admissions for COVID-19 and general mortality. RESULTS: the cohort included 618,964 subjects: 16.3% received two vaccinations in the same vaccination session, 8.5% received the influenza vaccination after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, 33.9% received it before and 41.1% did not receive an influenza vaccination. Those vaccinated against both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza had a combined HR of 0.73 (0.62-0.86) of hospitalisation for COVID-19 and 0.55 (0.49-0.62) of overall mortality compared to those vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 only. CONCLUSIONS: influenza vaccination combined with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination increases the protective effect against hospitalisations and overall mortality compared to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination alone. Both organisational and communication actions aimed to promote and encourage vaccination are required."	"Russo, Antonio Giampiero

In this study, we aimed to investigate the negative relationship between mortality and COVID-19 vaccination at country level. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted an exploratory, correlational, country-level analysis of open data centralized by Our World in Data concerning the cumulative COVID-19 mortality for the winter wave (October 2021-March 2022) of the pandemic as function of the vaccination rate in October 2021. METHODS: We controlled variables that capture country-level social development and level of testing. We also deployed three segmentation tactics, distinguishing among countries based on their level of COVID-19 testing, age structure, and types of vaccines used. RESULTS: Controlling for confounding factors did not highlight a statistically significant relationship between vaccination and cumulative mortality in the total country sample. Still, a strong, significant, negative relationship between cumulative mortality (log scale) and vaccination was highlighted through segmentation analysis for countries positioned at the higher end of the social development spectrum. The strongest estimate for vaccine effectiveness at ecological level was obtained for the set of countries that used Western-only vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 testing (log scale) has a significant and positive relationship with cumulative mortality for all subsamples, consistent with patterns of under- and overreporting of COVID-19 deaths at country level, partly driven by testing. This indicates that testing intensity should be controlled as a potential confounder in future ecological analyses of COVID-19 mortality."	"2666-5352

Non-specific effects of vaccines
Tolerance"	"Contrary to the long-held belief that the effects of vaccines are specific for the disease they were created; compelling evidence has demonstrated that vaccines can exert positive or deleterious non-specific effects (NSEs). In this review, we compiled research reports from the last 40 years, which were found based on the PubMed search for the epidemiological and immunological studies on the non-specific effects (NSEs) of the most common human vaccines. Analysis of information showed that live vaccines induce positive NSEs, whereas non-live vaccines induce several negative NSEs, including increased female mortality associated with enhanced susceptibility to other infectious diseases, especially in developing countries. These negative NSEs are determined by the vaccination sequence, the antigen concentration in vaccines, the type of vaccine used (live vs. non-live), and also by repeated vaccination. We do not recommend stopping using non-live vaccines, as they have demonstrated to protect against their target disease, so the suggestion is that their detrimental NSEs can be minimized simply by changing the current vaccination sequence. High IgG4 antibody levels generated in response to repeated inoculation with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could be associated with a higher mortality rate from unrelated diseases and infections by suppressing the immune system. Since most COVID-19 vaccinated countries are reporting high percentages of excess mortality not directly attributable to deaths from such disease, the NSEs of mRNA vaccines on overall mortality should be studied in depth."

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in three Albanian hospitals between 19 February and 14 December 2021. All participants underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serological testing at enrolment, regular serology throughout, and PCR testing when symptomatic.Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 and against all severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections (symptomatic or asymptomatic) was estimated. VE was estimated using a Cox regression model, with vaccination status as a time-varying variable. FINDINGS: In total, 1504 HCWs were enrolled in this study; 70% had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. VE was 65.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 37.7-80.5] against COVID-19, 58.2% (95% CI 15.7-79.3) among participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 73.6% (95% CI 24.3-90.8) among participants with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. For BNT162b2 alone, VE was 69.5% (95% CI 44.5-83.2). During the period when the Delta variant was predominant, VE was 67.1% (95% CI 38.3-82.5). VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection for the full study period was 36.9% (95% CI 15.8-52.7). INTERPRETATION: This study found moderate primary series VE against COVID-19 among healthcare workers in Albania. These results support the continued promotion of COVID-19 vaccination in Albania, and highlight the benefits of vaccination in populations with high levels of prior infection."	"2772-7076

We measured rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severe outcomes in a large population attending advanced CKD clinics during the first 21 months of the pandemic. We examined risk factors for infection and case fatality, and we assessed vaccine effectiveness in this population. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data on demographics, diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, outcomes, and associated risk factors, including vaccine effectiveness, for people attending a province-wide network of advanced CKD clinics during the first four waves of the pandemic in Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: In a population of 20,235 patients with advanced CKD, 607 were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection over 21 months. The case fatality rate at 30 days was 19% overall but declined from 29% in the first wave to 14% in the fourth. Hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates were 41% and 12%, respectively, and 4% started long-term dialysis within 90 days. Significant risk factors for diagnosed infection on multivariable analysis included lower eGFR, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, attending advanced CKD clinics for more than 2 years, non-White ethnicity, lower income, living in the Greater Toronto Area, and long-term care home residency. Being doubly vaccinated was associated with lower 30-day case fatality rate (odds ratio [OR], 0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03 to 0.52). Older age (OR, 1.06 per year; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.08) and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR, 1.11 per unit; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.23) were associated with higher 30-day case fatality rate. CONCLUSIONS: People attending advanced CKD clinics and diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first 21 months of the pandemic had high case fatality and hospitalization rates. Fatality rates were significantly lower in those who were doubly vaccinated.

We assessed whether transfusion of plasma or platelet products during periods of increasing prevalence of blood donor SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination was associated with changes in outcomes in hospitalized patients without COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults who received plasma or platelet transfusions at 21 hospitals during pre-COVID-19 (3/1/2018-2/29/2020), COVID-19 pre-vaccine (3/1/2020-2/28/2021), and COVID-19 post-vaccine (3/1/2021-8/31/2022) study periods. We used multivariable logistic regression with generalized estimating equations to adjust for demographics and comorbidities to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 21,750 hospitalizations of 18,584 transfusion recipients without COVID-19, there were 697 post-transfusion thrombotic events, and oxygen requirements were increased in 1751 hospitalizations. Intensive care unit length of stay (n = 11,683) was 3 days (interquartile range 1-5), hospital mortality occurred in 3223 (14.8%), and 30-day rehospitalization in 4144 (23.7%). Comparing the pre-COVID, pre-vaccine and post-vaccine study periods, there were no trends in thromboses (OR 0.9 [95% CI 0.8, 1.1]; p = .22) or oxygen requirements (OR 1.0 [95% CI 0.9, 1.1]; p = .41). In parallel, there were no trends across study periods for ICU length of stay (p = .83), adjusted hospital mortality (OR 1.0 [95% CI 0.9-1.0]; p = .36), or 30-day rehospitalization (p = .29). DISCUSSION: Transfusion of plasma and platelet blood components collected during the pre-vaccine and post-vaccine periods of the COVID-19 pandemic was not associated with increased adverse outcomes in transfusion recipients without COVID-19."

METHODS: We analyzed elderly patients (age groups: 65-70, 71-75, 76-80, and >80 years old) with hematologic malignancies included in the EPICOVIDEHA registry between January 2020 and July 2022. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were conducted to identify factors influencing death in COVID-19 patients with hematological malignancy. RESULTS: The study included data from 3,603 elderly patients (aged 65 or older) with hematological malignancy, with a majority being male (58.1%) and a significant proportion having comorbidities. The patients were divided into four age groups, and the analysis assessed COVID-19 outcomes, vaccination status, and other variables in relation to age and pandemic waves. The 90-day survival rate for patients with COVID-19 was 71.2%, with significant differences between groups. The pandemic waves had varying impacts, with the first wave affecting patients over 80 years old, the second being more severe in 65-70, and the third being the least severe in all age groups. Factors contributing to 90-day mortality included age, comorbidities, lymphopenia, active malignancy, acute leukemia, less than three vaccine doses, severe COVID-19, and using only corticosteroids as treatment. CONCLUSION: These data underscore the heterogeneity of elderly hematological patients, highlight the different impacts of COVID-19 waves and the pivotal importance of vaccination, and may help in planning future healthcare efforts."

Vaccination"	"AIMS: Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a serious heart disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. TTS has been related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccine; however, the current data are scarce. We aimed to examine the associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and its vaccine with TTS. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study in a cohort of 3 237 909 adults from the largest healthcare provider in Israel. Patients were followed from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2021 for the occurrence of TTS. Ten randomly selected controls were matched to each case of TTS on age, sex, and duration of follow-up. Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccine in the prior 30 days was assessed in cases and controls. RESULTS: During the follow-up 144 patients developed TTS and were matched to 1440 controls. The mean age of cases and their matched controls was 71.4 ± 12 years, and 136 (94.4%) of them were women. Conditional logistic regression analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccine were not associated with an increased risk of TTS; odds ratio (OR) = 2.04 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.50-8.2] and 0.87 (0.49-1.54), respectively. The absolute number of TTS cases in the prepandemic period (March-December 2018-2019) was 82 in 2018 and 80 in 2019. The number of TTS cases decreased to 56 during the corresponding period of 2020 (first pandemic year) and increased back to 81 in 2022. CONCLUSION: No significant association was found between SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination and TTS occurrence."	"1558-2035

mRNA Vaccines"	"In December 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, and in February 2021, FDA issued an EUA for the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccine. After each EUA, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued interim recommendations for vaccine use; currently Pfizer-BioNTech is authorized and recommended for persons aged ≥12 years and Moderna and Janssen for persons aged ≥18 years (1-3). Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, administered as 2-dose series, are mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, whereas the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, administered as a single dose, is a recombinant replication-incompetent adenovirus-vector vaccine. As of July 22, 2021, 187 million persons in the United States had received at least 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine (4); close monitoring of safety surveillance has demonstrated that serious adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination are rare (5,6). Three medical conditions have been reported in temporal association with receipt of COVID-19 vaccines. Two of these (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome [TTS], a rare syndrome characterized by venous or arterial thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, and Guillain-Barré syndrome [GBS], a rare autoimmune neurologic disorder characterized by ascending weakness and paralysis) have been reported after Janssen COVID-19 vaccination. One (myocarditis, cardiac inflammation) has been reported after Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination, particularly after the second dose; these were reviewed together and will hereafter be referred to as mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. ACIP has met three times to review the data associated with these reports of serious adverse events and has comprehensively assessed the benefits and risks associated with receipt of these vaccines. During the most recent meeting in July 2021, ACIP determined that, overall, the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality outweigh the risks for these rare serious adverse events in adults aged ≥18 years; this balance of benefits and risks varied by age and sex. ACIP continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination in all persons aged ≥12 years. CDC and FDA continue to closely monitor reports of serious adverse events and will present any additional data to ACIP for consideration. Information regarding risks and how they vary by age and sex and type of vaccine should be disseminated to providers, vaccine recipients, and the public."	"1545-861x

Vaccination"	"OBJECTIVE: To estimate population health outcomes with delayed second dose versus standard schedule of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. DESIGN: Simulation agent based modeling study. SETTING: Simulated population based on real world US county. PARTICIPANTS: The simulation included 100 000 agents, with a representative distribution of demographics and occupations. Networks of contacts were established to simulate potentially infectious interactions though occupation, household, and random interactions. INTERVENTIONS: Simulation of standard covid-19 vaccination versus delayed second dose vaccination prioritizing the first dose. The simulation runs were replicated 10 times. Sensitivity analyses included first dose vaccine efficacy of 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% after day 12 post-vaccination; vaccination rate of 0.1%, 0.3%, and 1% of population per day; assuming the vaccine prevents only symptoms but not asymptomatic spread (that is, non-sterilizing vaccine); and an alternative vaccination strategy that implements delayed second dose for people under 65 years of age, but not until all those above this age have been vaccinated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative covid-19 mortality, cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections, and cumulative hospital admissions due to covid-19 over 180 days. RESULTS: Over all simulation replications, the median cumulative mortality per 100 000 for standard dosing versus delayed second dose was 226 v 179, 233 v 207, and 235 v 236 for 90%, 80%, and 70% first dose efficacy, respectively. The delayed second dose strategy was optimal for vaccine efficacies at or above 80% and vaccination rates at or below 0.3% of the population per day, under both sterilizing and non-sterilizing vaccine assumptions, resulting in absolute cumulative mortality reductions between 26 and 47 per 100 000. The delayed second dose strategy for people under 65 performed consistently well under all vaccination rates tested. CONCLUSIONS: A delayed second dose vaccination strategy, at least for people aged under 65, could result in reduced cumulative mortality under certain conditions."	"1756-1833

SARS-CoV-2"	"Background: Colombia's national COVID-19 vaccination plan began in February of 2021. It gave priority to older adults, who constituted 77.7% of deaths from this illness in the year 2020. The main goal of the plan is to decrease specific mortality and the number of serious COVID-19 cases, however, the number of deaths avoided by this strategy is unknown. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of avoided deaths in Colombia by fully vaccinating older adults against COVID-19, during the first year of the implementation of the national vaccination plan. Methods: This study took on the design of an ecological, longitudinal study. Full vaccination coverage for older adults was calculated for each epidemiological week and age group from March to December 2021, based on which the number of avoided COVID-19 deaths was estimated. A sensitivity analysis was performed taking into account variations in the vaccines' effectiveness by age group. Results: In Colombia, over 5.3 million adults 60 years of age and older received full COVID-19 vaccinations between March and December 2021. During that same period, nearly 46,000 deaths of older adults from this cause were registered. We estimated that vaccination has avoided around 22,000 more older adults from dying from COVID-19 in Colombia, that is, 32.4% of expected deaths in 2021. According to the sensitivity analysis, the number of lives saved ranged from 19,597 to 36,507. Conclusions: Colombia's strategy to vaccinate older adults against COVID-19 has avoided mortality for this age group from being 48.0% higher than what was observed during the study period. Even more lives have been saved when taking into account the parameters that were defined and the omission of the contribution from partial vaccinations."	"2046-1402

The aim of this study was to determine predictors of mortality in this population. METHODOLOGY: We conducted an observational, retrospective, cohort study collecting data from pre and post-vaccine from the electronic medical records of a single dialysis center at Hygeia International Hospital Tirana, Albania. RESULTS: Of 170 dialysis patients, 52 were diagnosed with COVID-19. The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in our study was 30.5%. The mean age was 61.5 ± 12.3 years and 65.4% were men. The mortality rate in our cohort was 19.2%. Mortality rates were higher in patients with diabetic nephropathy (p < 0.04) and peripheral vascular disease (p < 0.01). Elevated C- reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.018), high red blood cell distribution width (RDW) (p < 0.03), and low lymphocyte and eosinophil counts, were found to be risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. ROC analysis identified lymphopenia and eosinopenia as the strongest predictors of mortality. After the vaccine administration, the mortality rate in the vaccinated population was 8%, in contrast to the 66.7% mortality rate that was found in the unvaccinated group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that risk factors for the development of severe COVID-19 infection were RDW, low lymphocyte and eosinophil counts, elevated levels of CRP. Lymphopenia and eosinopenia were determined as the most important predictors of mortality, in our cohort. Mortality was notably lower among vaccinated patients."	"1972-2680

SUMMARY ANSWER: There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the mass roll-out of vaccines helped to boost herd immunity and reduced hospital admissions, morbidity, and mortality. Still, many were concerned about the safety of vaccines for pregnancy, which may have limited their uptake among pregnant women and those planning a pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception until June 2022 using a combination of keywords and MeSH terms. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We included observational and interventional studies that enrolled pregnant women and evaluated any of the available COVID-19 vaccines compared to placebo or no vaccination. We primarily reported on miscarriage in addition to ongoing pregnancy and/or live birth. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We included data from 21 studies (5 randomized trials and 16 observational studies) reporting on 149 685 women. The pooled rate of miscarriage among women who received a COVID-19 vaccine was 9% (n = 14 749/123 185, 95% CI 0.05-0.14). Compared to those who received a placebo or no vaccination, women who received a COVID-19 vaccine did not have a higher risk of miscarriage (risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% CI 0.89-1.28, I2 35.8%) and had comparable rates for ongoing pregnancy or live birth (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97-1.03, I2 10.72%). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our analysis was limited to observational evidence with varied reporting, high heterogeneity and risk of bias across included studies, which may limit the generalizability and confidence in our findings. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: COVID-19 vaccines are not associated with an increase in the risk of miscarriage or reduced rates of ongoing pregnancy or live birth among women of reproductive age. The current evidence remains limited and larger population studies are needed to further evaluate the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy.

In November 2021, NH residents in the Canadian province of Manitoba became eligible to receive three doses of mRNA vaccine but coverage with three doses has not been universal. The objective of this study was to compare the protection from infection conferred by one, two, and three doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine compared to no vaccination among residents of nursing homes experiencing SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. METHODS: Infection Prevention and Control reports from 8 rural nursing homes experiencing outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 between January 6, 2022, and March 5, 2022, were analyzed. Attack rates and the number needed to vaccinate (NNV) were calculated. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 attack rate was 65% among NH residents not vaccinated, 58% among residents who received 1-2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and 28% among residents who had received 3 vaccine doses. The NNV to prevent one nursing home resident from SARS-CoV-2 infection during an outbreak was 3 for a vaccination with 3 doses and 14 for 1-2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. The superiority of receiving the third dose was statistically significant compared to 1-2 doses (Chi-Squared, p < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Nursing home residents who received three doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine were at lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to those who received 1-2 doses. Our analyses lend support to the protective effects of the third dose of mRNA vaccine for NH residents in the event of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak."	"1532-5415

Yet some approaches to the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by socioeconomic, corporate, and political interests, have undermined key pillars of ethical medical science. We explore significant mistakes that may have occurred in recent pandemic control, in order to better navigate the future. Within corporate and geopolitical infrastructure, we review the COVID-19 pandemic and novel mRNA and viral-vector DNA COVID-19 vaccines, deployed by wealthy western countries. The pandemic, together with rollouts of unconventional, gene-based vaccine technology, has provided experimental opportunity to engineer social control of entire populations. The haste and scale of development, production, and distribution of these new pharmaceuticals is unprecedented in history. Key phase III clinical trials for these products are yet to be fully completed, despite administration to billions of people. Mass vaccination of workforces has been mandated, and vaccine mandates correlate with excess mortality. Many independent data sets concur - we have experienced a pandemic of viral illness, followed by a pandemic of vaccine injury. For Australia, matters have operated the other way around. Vaccination followed later by the main viral wave. Australian excess mortality data correlates with this. Neither risk nor cost can justify these products for the vast majority of people. Lack of efficacy against infection and transmission, and the equivalent benefits of natural immunity, obviate mandatory therapeutics. With the many gene-based pharmaceuticals planned, a new era of pathology lies ahead. We should pause, reflect, and reaffirm essential freedoms, welcome the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, embrace natural immunity, and lift all mandated medical therapy."	"1618-0631

METHODS: A cross-sectional study of second wave and fourth wave deaths and vaccination coverage. The frequencies of attributes of deceased population in the two waves were compared, including comorbidities. Machado's method was used to calculate an estimate of the number of deaths averted in the fourth wave. RESULTS: There were 1 133 deaths in the second wave and 754 deaths in the fourth wave. It was calculated that approximately 3 763 deaths were averted in the fourth wave in Cali in the context of vaccination roll-out. CONCLUSIONS: The decline in COVID-19-associated mortality observed supports the continuation of the vaccination program. Given the lack of data to explain other possible reasons for this decline, such as on the severity of novel viral variants, the limitations of the study are discussed."	"1680-5348

The aim of the present study was to assess the clinical characteristics, outcomes and therapeutic strategies applied in HM patients hospitalized during the post-vaccine period in Greece. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From June 2021 to October 2022, 60 HM patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Exploratory end-points included the incidence of intubation, probability of recovery, mortality, and duration of remdesivir (RDV) administration. RESULTS: Overall, mechanical ventilation (MV) was required for five patients and crude mortality was 8.3%. HM of lymphocytic origin (p=0.035) and obesity (p=0.03) were the main determinants of the risk of intubation and among several laboratory markers, only LDH>520 IU/l was proven to be an independent MV predictor (p=0.038). The number of co-existing comorbidities (p=0.05) and disease severity on admission (p<0.001) were found to rule the probability of recovery, and dexamethasone was associated with worse prognosis, particularly in patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. RDV was administered to the entire cohort, of whom 38 were managed with an extended course. In the multivariate analysis, patients with HM of lymphocytic origin were more likely to receive RDV for more than five days (p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Our study emphasizes the frailty of HM patients, even in the era of Omicron-variant predominance, and underlines the need to optimize therapy."	"1791-7549

Mathematical modeling is a necessary method for investigating the dynamics of epidemic diseases. In the current article, an effort has been made to cultivate a novel COVID-19 compartment mathematical model by incorporating vaccinated populations. Primarily, the fundamental characteristics of the model, such as positivity and boundedness of solutions, are established. Thereafter, equilibrium analysis of steady states has been illustrated through vaccine reproduction number. Further, a nonlinear least square curve fitting technique has been employed to recognize the best fitted model parameters from the COVID-19 mortality data of five regions, namely Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and Russia. The numerical framework of the model has been added to interpret the consequence of various control schemes (pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical) on COVID-19 dynamics, and it has been ascertained that all the control protocols have a positive influence on curtailing the COVID-19 transference in the aforementioned regions. In addition, the essence of vaccine efficacy and vaccine-induced immunity are examined by considering different scenarios. Our analysis demonstrates that the disease will be wiped off from the Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttarakhand and Sikkim regions of India, while it shall persist in Russia for some more time. It is also found that, if a vaccine calamity arises, the government should majorly focus on permanent drug treatment of hospitalized individuals rather than vaccination."	"1951-6401

On 18 December 2020, the South African government also announced the emergence of a new variant in a scenario similar to that of the UK, which is referred to as variant 501.V2. Another important milestone regarding this pandemic was the beginning, in December 2020, of vaccination campaigns in several countries. There are several vaccines, with different characteristics, developed by various laboratories and research centers. A natural question arises: what could be the impact of these variants and vaccines on the spread of COVID-19? Many models have been proposed to simulate the spread of COVID-19 but, to the best of our knowledge, none of them incorporates the effects of potential SARS-CoV-2 variants together with the vaccines in the spread of COVID-19. We develop here a θ -  ij -SVEIHQRD mathematical model able to simulate the possible impact of this type of variants and of the vaccines, together with the main mechanisms influencing the disease spread. The model may be of interest for policy makers, as a tool to evaluate different possible future scenarios. We apply the model to the particular case of Italy (as an example of study case), showing different outcomes. We observe that the vaccines may reduce the infections, but they might not be enough for avoiding a new wave, with the current expected vaccination rates in that country, if the control measures are relaxed. Furthermore, a more contagious variant could increase significantly the cases, becoming the most common way of infection. We show how, even with the pandemic cases slowing down (with an effective reproduction number less than 1) and the disease seeming to be under control, the effective reproduction number of just the new variant may be greater than 1 and, eventually, the number of infections would increase towards a new disease wave. Therefore, a rigorous follow-up of the evolution of the number of infections with any potentially more dangerous new variant is of paramount importance at any stage of the pandemic."	"1878-7274

The present meta-analysis study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in reducing the incidence, hospitalization, and mortality from COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search was performed independently in Scopus, PubMed via Medline, ProQuest, and Google Scholar electronic databases as well as preprint servers using the keywords under study. We used random-effect models and the heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using I (2) and χ(2) statistics. In addition, the Pooled Vaccine Effectiveness (PVE) obtained from the studies was calculated by converting based on the type of outcome. RESULTS: A total of 54 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The PVE against SARS-COV 2 infection were 71% [odds ratio (OR) = 0.29, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.23-0.36] in the first dose and 87% (OR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.08-0.21) in the second dose. The PVE for preventing hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection was 73% (OR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.18-0.41) in the first dose and 89% (OR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.07-0.17) in the second dose. With regard to the type of vaccine, mRNA-1273 and combined studies in the first dose and ChAdOx1 and mRNA-1273 in the second dose had the highest effectiveness in preventing infection. Regarding the COVID-19-related mortality, PVE was 68% (HR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.23-0.45) in the first dose and 92% (HR = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.02-0.29) in the second dose. CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis indicated that vaccination against COVID-19 with BNT162b2 mRNA, mRNA-1273, and ChAdOx1, and also their combination, was associated with a favorable effectiveness against SARS-CoV2 incidence rate, hospitalization, and mortality rate in the first and second doses in different populations. We suggest that to prevent the severe form of the disease in the future, and, in particular, in the coming epidemic picks, vaccination could be the best strategy to prevent the severe form of the disease.

Evidence showed that vaccines significantly reduced infection, severity, and mortality across a wide age range of populations. This study investigated the hospitalization and mortality by vaccination status among COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh and identified the vaccine's effectiveness against severe outcomes in real-world settings. Between August and December 2021, we conducted this cross-sectional survey among 783 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients admitted to three dedicated COVID-19 hospitals in Bangladesh. The study used a semi-structured questionnaire to collect information. We reviewed the patient's records and gathered COVID-19 immunization status from the study participants or their caregivers. Patients with incomplete or partial data from the record were excluded from enrollment. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between key variables with a patient's vaccination status and mortality. The study revealed that overall hospitalization, severity, and morality were significantly high among unvaccinated study participants. Only one-fourth (25%) of hospitalized patients were found COVID-19 vaccinated. Morality among unvaccinated COVID-19 study participants was significantly higher (AOR: 7.17) than the vaccinated (11.17% vs. 1.53%). Severity was found to be seven times higher among unvaccinated patients. Vaccination coverage was higher in urban areas (29.8%) compared to rural parts (20.8%), and vaccine uptake was lower among female study participants (22.7%) than male (27.6%). The study highlighted the importance of COVID-19 vaccines in reducing mortality, hospitalization, and other severe consequences. We found a gap in vaccination coverage between urban and rural settings. The findings would encourage the entire population toward immunization and aid the policymakers in the ground reality so that more initiatives are taken to improve vaccination coverage among the pocket population."

This study explored the advantages of COVID-19 vaccination in individuals with cognitive disorders by analyzing health-related variables and outcomes. METHODS: A prospective cohort study analyzed electronic medical records of 25,733 older adults with cognitive disorders and 65,544 older adults without cognitive disorders from March 2020 to February 2022. COVID-19 vaccination status was the primary exposure variable, categorized as fully vaccinated or unvaccinated. The primary outcomes measured were all-cause mortality and hospitalization rates within 14 and 400 days post-vaccination. Data on vaccination status, demographics, comorbidities, testing history, and clinical outcomes were collected from electronic health records. The study was ethically approved by the relevant medical facility's Institutional Review Board (0075-22-MHS). RESULTS: Vaccinated individuals had significantly lower mortality rates in both groups. In the research group, the mortality rate was 52% (n = 1852) for unvaccinated individuals and 7% (n = 1,241) for vaccinated individuals (p < 0.001). Similarly, in the control group, the mortality rate was 13.58% (n = 1,508) for unvaccinated individuals and 1.85% (n = 936) for vaccinated individuals (p < 0.001), despite higher COVID-19 positivity rates. In the research group, 30.26% (n = 1,072) of unvaccinated individuals tested positive for COVID-19, compared to 37.16% (n = 6,492) of vaccinated individuals (p < 0.001). In the control group, 17.31% (n = 1922) of unvaccinated individuals were COVID-19 positive, while 37.25% (n = 18,873) of vaccinated individuals tested positive (p < 0.001). Vaccination also showed potential benefits in mental health support. The usage of antipsychotic drugs was lower in vaccinated individuals (28.43%, n = 4,967) compared to unvaccinated individuals (37.48%, n = 1,328; 95% CI [0.92-1.28], p < 0.001). Moreover, vaccinated individuals had lower antipsychotic drug prescription rates (23.88%, n = 4,171) compared to unvaccinated individuals (27.83%, n = 968; 95% CI [-1.02 to -0.63], p < 0.001). Vaccination appeared to have a positive impact on managing conditions like diabetes, with 38.63% (n = 6,748) of vaccinated individuals having diabetes compared to 41.55% (n = 1,472) of unvaccinated individuals (95% CI [0.24, 0.48], p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: The findings highlight the importance of vaccination in safeguarding vulnerable populations during the pandemic and call for further research to optimize healthcare strategies for individuals with cognitive disorders."

METHODS: Using electronic health care records in Hong Kong, we included adults with COPD or asthma or both and hospitalised for severe respiratory exacerbation in a self-controlled case series (SCCS) study between 23/02/2021 and 30/11/2022. Conditional Poisson regression models were used to estimate the incidence of outcomes within exposure periods (28 days after each dose) compared with baseline periods. Cox proportional hazard models evaluated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-related mortality, hospitalisation, and severe complications, including admission to intensive care units or ventilatory support. The VE assessment was based on vaccine types and the number of doses. RESULTS: In the SCCS, 343 CoronaVac recipients and 212 BNT162b2 recipients were included. No increased risk of outcomes was observed within the exposure periods. In the cohort study, 108,423 and 83,323 patients received ≥ 2 doses of CoronaVac and BNT162b2, respectively. The VE (95% CI) against COVID-related mortality, hospitalisation, and severe complications after two-dose CoronaVac was 77% (74-80%), 18% (6-23%), and 29% (12-43%), respectively, while for the two-dose regimen of BNT162b2, it was 92% (91-94%), 33% (30-37%), and 57% (45-66%), respectively. Higher VE against COVID-related mortality, hospitalisation, and severe complications was found for the three-dose regimen of CoronaVac (94%, 40%, and 71%) and BNT162b2 (98%, 65%, and 83%). Administering a fourth dose of either vaccine showed additional reductions in COVID-related outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Among people with COPD and asthma, the COVID-19 vaccines CoronaVac and BNT162b2 did not increase severe exacerbations and achieved moderate-to-high effectiveness against COVID-related outcomes. COVID-19 vaccination remains essential and should be encouraged to protect this vulnerable population in future epidemic waves."	"1179-1942

Long-term longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate these risks. The Scottish COVID cancer immunity prevalence (SCCAMP) study characterizes the incidence and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in patients with solid tumors undergoing ACT. This preliminary analysis includes 766 patients recruited since May 2020. METHODS: Patients with solid-organ cancers attending secondary care for active ACT consented to the collection of routine electronic health record data and serial blood samples over 12 months. Blood samples were tested for total SARS-CoV-2 antibody. RESULTS: A total of 766 participants were recruited between May 28, 2020 and October 31, 2021. Most received cytotoxic chemotherapy (79%). Among the participants, 48 (6.3%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Infection rates were unaffected by ACT, largely aligning with the local population. Mortality proportion was not higher with a recent positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (10.4% vs 10.6%). Multivariate analysis revealed lower infection rates in vaccinated patients regardless of chemotherapy (HR 0.307 [95% CI, 0.144-0.6548]) or immunotherapy (HR 0.314 [95% CI, 0.041-2.367]) treatment. A total of 96.3% of patients successfully raised SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after >2 vaccines. This was independent of the treatment type. CONCLUSION: This is the largest on-going longitudinal real-world dataset of patients undergoing ACT during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This preliminary analysis demonstrates that patients with solid tumors undergoing ACT have high protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection following COVID-19 vaccination. The SCCAMP study will evaluate long-term COVID-19 antibody trends, focusing on specific ACTs and patient subgroups."	"1549-490x

Treatment Outcome"	"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on postoperative mortality, pulmonary and thrombotic complications, readmissions and hospital lengths of stay among patients undergoing surgery in the United States. BACKGROUND: While vaccination prevents COVID-19, little is known about its impact on postoperative complications. METHODS: This is a nationwide observational cohort study of all 1,255 Veterans Affairs facilities nationwide. We compared patients undergoing surgery at least 2 weeks after their second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, to contemporary propensity score matched controls. Primary endpoints were 30-day mortality and postoperative COVID-19 infection. Secondary endpoints were pulmonary or thrombotic complications, readmissions, and hospital lengths of stay. RESULTS: 30,681 patients met inclusion criteria. After matching, there were 3,104 in the vaccination group (1,903 received the Pfizer BioNTech, and 1,201 received the Moderna vaccine) and 7,438 controls. Full COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower rates of postoperative 30-day COVID-19 infection (Incidence Rate Ratio and 95% confidence intervals, 0.09 [0.01,0.44]), pulmonary complications (0.54 [0.39, 0.72]), thrombotic complications (0.68 [0.46, 0.99]) and decreased hospital lengths of stay (0.78 [0.69, 0.89]). Complications were also low in vaccinated patients who tested COVID-19 positive before surgery but events were too few to detect a significant difference compared to controls. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccination is associated with lower rates of postoperative morbidity. The benefit is most pronounced among individuals who have never had a COVID-19 infection before surgery."

To address this issue, all publications relevant to the effectiveness of vaccines against the Delta variant were searched in the Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, and Medline (via PubMed) databases up to 15 October 2021. A total of 15 studies (36 datasets) were included in the meta-analysis. After the first dose, the VE against the Delta variant for each vaccine was 0.567 (95% CI 0.520-0.613) for Pfizer-BioNTech, 0.72 (95% CI 0.589-0.822) for Moderna, 0.44 (95% CI 0.301-0.588) for AstraZeneca, and 0.138 (95% CI 0.076-0.237) for CoronaVac. Meta-analysis of 2,375,957 vaccinated cases showed that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had the highest VE against the infection after the second dose, at 0.837 (95% CI 0.672-0.928), and third dose, at 0.972 (95% CI 0.96-0.978), as well as the highest VE for the prevention of severe infection or death, at 0.985 (95% CI 0.95-0.99), amongst all COVID-19 vaccines. The short-term effectiveness of vaccines, especially mRNA-based vaccines, for the prevention of the Delta variant infection, hospitalization, severe infection, and death is supported by this study. Limitations include a lack of long-term efficacy data, and under-reporting of COVID-19 infection cases in observational studies, which has the potential to falsely skew VE rates. Overall, this study supports the decisions by public health decision makers to promote the population vaccination rate to control the Delta variant infection and the emergence of further variants."

During the Omicron wave, approximately 70% of the Israeli adult population was fully vaccinated, but the efficacy of the vaccine was questioned. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all adult patients admitted to the COVID-19 departments in Rabin Medical Center, during the Delta wave and the Omicron wave. Patients were matched in the 2 waves using the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method and risk for mechanical ventilation and 30-day all-cause mortality was assessed. RESULTS: Vaccination had a significant effect on 30-day mortality in the Delta and Omicron waves with adjusted OR of 0.35 (0.17-0.70) and 0.5 (0.27-0.95) respectively. Nonetheless, the rate of mechanical ventilation was similar between the groups with OR of 0.75 (0.52-1.09) and 0.64 (0.40-1.01). Vaccination status did not change the length of admission in both waves. CONCLUSION: We observed a decreased risk for 30-day mortality among vaccinated patients during the Delta and Omicron waves in Israel. This association, even though consistent, was of a lesser magnitude during the Omicron wave."	"1578-8989

Strict social distance and influenza vaccination have been recommended to avoid co-infections between influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2. Scattered reports suggested a protective effect of influenza vaccine on COVID-19 development and severity. We analyzed 51 studies on the capacity of influenza vaccination to affect infection with SARS-CoV-2, hospitalization, admission to Intensive Care Units (ICU), and mortality. All subjects taken into consideration did not receive any anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, although their status with respect to previous infections with SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Comparison between vaccinated and not-vaccinated subjects for each of the four endpoints was expressed as odds ratio (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs); all analyses were performed by DerSimonian and Laird model, and Hartung-Knapp model when studies were less than 10. In a total of 61 029 936 subjects from 33 studies, influenza vaccination reduced frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection [OR plus 95% CI = 0.70 (0.65-0.77)]. The effect was significant in all studies together, in health care workers and in the general population; distance from influenza vaccination and the type of vaccine were also of importance. In 98 174 subjects from 11 studies, frequency of ICU admission was reduced with influenza vaccination [OR (95% CI) = 0.71 (0.54-0.94)]; the effect was significant in all studies together, in pregnant women and in hospitalized subjects. In contrast, in 4 737 328 subjects from 14 studies hospitalization was not modified [OR (95% CI) = 1.05 (0.82-1.35)], and in 4 139 660 subjects from 19 studies, mortality was not modified [OR (95% CI) = 0.76 (0.26-2.20)]. Our study emphasizes the importance of influenza vaccination in the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection."	"1096-9071

METHODS: Capitalizing on OnCovid (NCT04393974) registry data we reported COVID-19 mortality and proxies of COVID-19 morbidity, including post-COVID-19 outcomes, according to the vaccination status of the included patients. RESULTS: 2090 eligible patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between 02/2020 and 11/2021 were included, of whom 1930 (92.3%) unvaccinated, 91 (4.4%) fully vaccinated and 69 (3.3%) partially vaccinated. With the exception of a higher prevalence of patients from the UK (p = 0.0003) and receiving systemic anticancer therapy at COVID-19 diagnosis (p = 0.0082) among fully vaccinated patients, no demographics/oncological features were associated with vaccination status. The 14-days case fatality rate (CFR) (5.5% vs 20.7%, p = 0.0004) and the 28-days CFR (13.2% vs 27.4%, p = 0.0028) demonstrated a significant improvement for fully vaccinated patients in comparison with unvaccinated patients. The receipt of prior full vaccination was also associated with reduced symptomatic COVID-19 (79.1% vs 88.5%, p = 0.0070), need of COVID-19 oriented therapy (34.9% vs 63.2%, p < 0.0001), complications from COVID-19 (28.6% vs 39.4%, p = 0.0379), hospitalizations due to COVID-19 (42.2% vs 52.5%, p = 0.0007) and oxygen therapy requirement (35.7% vs 52%, p = 0.0036). Following Inverse Probability Treatment Weighting (IPTW) procedure no statistically significant difference according to the vaccination status was confirmed; however, all COVID-19 related outcomes were concordantly in favour of full vaccination. Among the 1228 (58.8%) patients who underwent a formal reassessment at participating centres after COVID-19 resolution, fully vaccinated patients experienced less sequelae than unvaccinated patients (6.7% vs 17.2%, p = 0.0320). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides initial evidence in support of the beneficial effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines against morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 in patients with cancer."	"1879-0852

SARS-CoV-2"	"BACKGROUND: The omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible and escapes vaccine-induced immunity. We aimed to describe outcomes due to COVID-19 during the omicron outbreak compared with the prevaccination period and alpha (B.1.1.7) and delta (B.1.617.2) waves in patients with cancer in Europe. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of the multicentre OnCovid Registry study, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, who had a history of solid or haematological malignancy that was either active or in remission. Patient were recruited from 37 oncology centres from UK, Italy, Spain, France, Belgium, and Germany. Participants were followed up from COVID-19 diagnosis until death or loss to follow-up, while being treated as per standard of care. For this analysis, we excluded data from centres that did not actively enter new data after March 1, 2021 (in France, Germany, and Belgium). We compared measures of COVID-19 morbidity, which were complications from COVID-19, hospitalisation due to COVID-19, and requirement of supplemental oxygen and COVID-19-specific therapies, and COVID-19 mortality across three time periods designated as the prevaccination (Feb 27 to Nov 30, 2020), alpha-delta (Dec 1, 2020, to Dec 14, 2021), and omicron (Dec 15, 2021, to Jan 31, 2022) phases. We assessed all-cause case-fatality rates at 14 days and 28 days after diagnosis of COVID-19 overall and in unvaccinated and fully vaccinated patients and in those who received a booster dose, after adjusting for country of origin, sex, age, comorbidities, tumour type, stage, and status, and receipt of systemic anti-cancer therapy. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04393974, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: As of Feb 4, 2022 (database lock), the registry included 3820 patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 between Feb 27, 2020, and Jan 31, 2022. 3473 patients were eligible for inclusion (1640 [47·4%] were women and 1822 [52·6%] were men, with a median age of 68 years [IQR 57-77]). 2033 (58·5%) of 3473 were diagnosed during the prevaccination phase, 1075 (31·0%) during the alpha-delta phase, and 365 (10·5%) during the omicron phase. Among patients diagnosed during the omicron phase, 113 (33·3%) of 339 were fully vaccinated and 165 (48·7%) were boosted, whereas among those diagnosed during the alpha-delta phase, 152 (16·6%) of 915 were fully vaccinated and 21 (2·3%) were boosted. Compared with patients diagnosed during the prevaccination period, those who were diagnosed during the omicron phase had lower case-fatality rates at 14 days (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0·32 [95% CI 0·19-0·61) and 28 days (0·34 [0·16-0·79]), complications due to COVID-19 (0·26 [0·17-0·46]), and hospitalisation due to COVID-19 (0·17 [0·09-0·32]), and had less requirements for COVID-19-specific therapy (0·22 [0·15-0·34]) and oxygen therapy (0·24 [0·14-0·43]) than did those diagnosed during the alpha-delta phase. Unvaccinated patients diagnosed during the omicron phase had similar crude case-fatality rates at 14 days (ten [25%] of 40 patients vs 114 [17%] of 656) and at 28 days (11 [27%] of 40 vs 184 [28%] of 656) and similar rates of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 (18 [43%] of 42 vs 266 [41%] of 652) and complications from COVID-19 (13 [31%] of 42 vs 237 [36%] of 659) as those diagnosed during the alpha-delta phase. INTERPRETATION: Despite time-dependent improvements in outcomes reported in the omicron phase compared with the earlier phases of the pandemic, patients with cancer remain highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 if they are not vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Our findings support universal vaccination of patients with cancer as a protective measure against morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

A prospective multicenter registry-based cohort study conducted from December 2020 to July 2022 by the Spanish Transplant and Cell Therapy group, was used to analyze the relationship of antibody response over time after full vaccination (at 3-6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months) (2 doses) and of booster doses with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection in 1551 patients with hematological disorders. At a median follow-up of 388 days after complete immunization, 266 out of 1551 (17%) developed breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection at median of 86 days (range 7-391) after full vaccination. The cumulative incidence was 18% [95% confidence interval (C.I.), 16-20%]. Multivariate analysis identified higher incidence in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients (29%) and with the use of corticosteroids (24.5%), whereas female sex (15.5%) and more than 1 year after last therapy (14%) were associated with a lower incidence (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Median antibody titers at different time points were significantly lower in breakthrough cases than in non-cases. A serological titer cut-off of 250 BAU/mL was predictive of breakthrough infection and its severity. SARS-CoV-2 infection-related mortality was encouragingly low (1.9%) in our series. Our study describes the incidence of and risk factors for COVID-19 breakthrough infections during the initial vaccination and booster doses in the 2021 to mid-2022 period. The level of antibody titers at any time after 2-dose vaccination is strongly linked with protection against both breakthrough infection and severe disease, even with the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant."

In this study, we describe the course of the vaccination program in Poland and the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze the vaccination rates and effectiveness stratified by age groups in Poland. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study based on the data on the vaccination rate and survival status among Polish citizens, obtained from the registries kept by the Polish Ministry of Health, the Statistics Poland, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The data were collected between week 53 of 2020 and week 3 of 2022. The final analysis included patients who were either not vaccinated at all or fully vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine. RESULTS: The database contained records of 36 362 777 individuals, of whom 14 441 506 (39.71%) were fully vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine and 14 220 548 (39.11%) were not vaccinated at all. The weekly average effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in preventing death was 92.62% and varied from 89.08% for the citizens aged 80 years and older, to 100% for individuals aged 5 to 17 years. The estimated mortality rate was significantly higher in the unvaccinated group than in the fully vaccinated group in the entire cohort (447.9 per 100 000 vs 43.76 per 100 000; P <0.001) in all age categories. CONCLUSIONS: The study results confirm high effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in preventing COVID‑19 deaths in all analyzed age groups."	"1897-9483

Despite high SARS-CoV-2 infection incidences, the rate of severe COVID-19 in children is low. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy or effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines approved in the EU for children aged 5-11 years. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included studies of any design identified through searching the COVID-19 L·OVE (living overview of evidence) platform up to Jan 23, 2023. We included studies with participants aged 5-11 years, with any COVID-19 vaccine approved by the European Medicines Agency-ie, mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), BNT162b2 Bivalent (against original strain and omicron [BA.4 or BA.5]), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), or mRNA-1273.214 (against original strain and omicron BA.1). Efficacy and effectiveness outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR-confirmed or antigen-test confirmed), symptomatic COVID-19, hospital admission due to COVID-19, COVID-19-related mortality, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and long-term effects of COVID-19 (long COVID or post-COVID-19 condition as defined by study investigators or per WHO definition). Safety outcomes of interest were serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest (eg, myocarditis), solicited local and systemic events, and unsolicited adverse events. We assessed risk of bias and rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. This study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022306822. FINDINGS: Of 5272 screened records, we included 51 (1·0%) studies (n=17 [33%] in quantitative synthesis). Vaccine effectiveness after two doses against omicron infections was 41·6% (95% CI 28·1-52·6; eight non-randomised studies of interventions [NRSIs]; CoE low), 36·2% (21·5-48·2; six NRSIs; CoE low) against symptomatic COVID-19, 75·3% (68·0-81·0; six NRSIs; CoE moderate) against COVID-19-related hospitalisations, and 78% (48-90, one NRSI; CoE very low) against MIS-C. Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related mortality was not estimable. Crude event rates for deaths in unvaccinated children were less than one case per 100 000 children, and no events were reported for vaccinated children (four NRSIs; CoE low). No study on vaccine effectiveness against long-term effects was identified. Vaccine effectiveness after three doses was 55% (50-60; one NRSI; CoE moderate) against omicron infections, and 61% (55-67; one NRSI; CoE moderate) against symptomatic COVID-19. No study reported vaccine efficacy or effectiveness against hospitalisation following a third dose. Safety data suggested no increased risk of serious adverse events (risk ratio [RR] 0·83 [95% CI 0·21-3·33]; two randomised controlled trials; CoE low), with approximately 0·23-1·2 events per 100 000 administered vaccines reported in real-life observations. Evidence on the risk of myocarditis was uncertain (RR 4·6 [0·1-156·1]; one NRSI; CoE low), with 0·13-1·04 observed events per 100 000 administered vaccines. The risk of solicited local reactions was 2·07 (1·80-2·39; two RCTs; CoE moderate) after one dose and 2·06 (1·70-2·49; two RCTs; CoE moderate) after two doses. The risk of solicited systemic reactions was 1·09 (1·04-1·16; two RCTs; CoE moderate) after one dose and 1·49 (1·34-1·65; two RCTs; CoE moderate) after two doses. The risk of unsolicited adverse events after two doses (RR 1·21 [1·07-1·38]; CoE moderate) was higher among mRNA-vaccinated compared with unvaccinated children. INTERPRETATION: In children aged 5-11 years, mRNA vaccines are moderately effective against infections with the omicron variant, but probably protect well against COVID-19 hospitalisations. Vaccines were reactogenic but probably safe. Findings of this systematic review can serve as a basis for public health policy and individual decision making on COVID-19 vaccination in children aged 5-11 years.

Vaccine effectiveness"	"BACKGROUND: Indigenous people have historically suffered devastating impacts from epidemics and continue to have lower access to healthcare and be especially vulnerable to respiratory infections. We estimated the coverage and effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases among indigenous people in Brazil. METHODS: We linked nationwide Covid-19 vaccination data with flu-like surveillance records and studied a cohort of vaccinated indigenous people aged ≥ 5 years between 18th January 2021 and 1st March 2022. We considered individuals unexposed from the date they received the first dose of vaccine until the 13th day of vaccination, partially vaccinated from the 14th day after the first dose until the 13th day after receiving the second dose, and fully vaccinated onwards. We estimated the Covid-19 vaccination coverage and used Poisson regression to calculate the relative risks (RR) and vaccine effectiveness (VE) of CoronaVac, ChAdOx1, and BNT162b2 against Covid-19 laboratory-confirmed cases incidence, mortality, hospitalisation, and hospital-progression to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or death. VE was estimated as (1-RR)*100, comparing unexposed to partially or fully vaccinated. RESULTS: By 1st March 2022, 48.7% (35.0-62.3) of eligible indigenous people vs. 74.8% (57.9-91.8) overall Brazilians had been fully vaccinated for Covid-19. Among fully vaccinated indigenous people, we found a lower risk of symptomatic cases (RR: 0.47, 95%CI: 0.40-0.56) and mortality (RR: 0.47, 95%CI: 0.14-1.56) after the 14th day of the second dose. VE for the three Covid-19 vaccines combined was 53% (95%CI:44-60%) for symptomatic cases, 53% (95%CI:-56-86%) for mortality and 41% (95%CI:-35-75%) for hospitalisation. In our sample, we found that vaccination did not reduce Covid-19 related hospitalisation. However, among hospitalised patients, we found a lower risk of progression to ICU (RR: 0.14, 95%CI: 0.02-0.81; VE: 87%, 95%CI:27-98%) and Covid-19 death (RR: 0.04, 95%CI:0.01-0.10; VE: 96%, 95%CI: 90-99%) after the 14th day of the second dose. CONCLUSIONS: Lower coverage but similar Covid-19 VE among indigenous people than overall Brazilians suggest the need to expand access, timely vaccination, and urgently offer booster doses to achieve a great level of protection among this group."

Latin America has been greatly affected, with high infection and mortality rates. Vaccination plays a crucial role in mitigating severe disease and controlling the pandemic. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing SARS-CoV-2 severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in hospitalized vaccination target groups in Ecuador. METHODS: This is a test-negative design study. We used data reported through sentinel surveillance of SARI between May 2021 and March 2022 in Ecuador. Patients with case criteria of SARI and hospitalized for a minimum of 24 hours were included in the study. Cases were defined as patients with SARI with a positive RT-qPCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and controls were those with a negative result. Information on vaccination status was obtained from the national vaccination registry, a valid dose of vaccination was considered when it was administered at least 14 days prior to symptom onset. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) (1-OR/OR) was calculated using a logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 1,277 patients were included in the analysis of VE. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness (aVE) in preventing hospitalization, adjusted for sex, age group, presence of one or more comorbidities, and period of the predominance of the omicron variant, was 44.5% for the partial primary schedule, 74.7% for the complete primary schedule, and 79.9% for the complete primary schedule plus booster doses. The aVE in avoiding ICU admissions was close to 80% with both the complete primary schedule and the booster doses, and in avoiding deaths, the aVE was 89% and 98%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In Ecuador, COVID-19 vaccination prevents hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths. The effectiveness of the vaccines improves with more doses, offering increased protection across all age groups."	"2590-1362

Objective The aim of the present study is to report coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalizations and mortality in 2,359 patients aged over 60 years in a reference center in Brazil. Method The evolution of hospitalizations and overall mortality of patients admitted to Hospital de Base were evaluated in a clinical trial, then selecting patients aged over 60 years, by age group every 10 years, from March 2020 to April 2021, and analyzing whether there was an increase in mortality in age groups, assessed by Fisher's exact test. Results There was an increase in mortality over the decades in this period, but a reduction in hospitalizations after patient vaccination. Conclusion Mortality in patients over 60 years of age is higher than in younger patients, where the vaccine has reduced their hospitalization, but individual patient protection regarding mortality needs further evaluation."

This study aimed to analyze the effect of vaccination against Covid-19, one year after its introduction in Brazil. METHODS: An ecological study that analyzed the general effect of vaccination against Covid-19 on disease morbidity and mortality indicators among the Brazilian population aged 18 years or older per epidemiological week (EW), comparing the pre and postvaccination period. Morbidity and mortality indicators were calculated from secondary databases (hospitalization rate, severity, case fatality rate and mortality) and vaccination coverage by age groups (18 to 59 years and 60 years or older). Morbimortality trends were estimated using the JoinPoint model and their association with vaccine coverage using the Poisson model. RESULTS: The average weekly percentage change (AWPC) of morbidity and mortality indicators reduced after the introduction of Covid-19 vaccination: hospitalization rate (from 15.3% to -6.0%), severity (from 0.4% to -0.2%), case fatality rate (from 0.3% to -0.2%) and mortality (from 20.5% to -4.3%). The following indicators were inversely associated with the increase in vaccine coverage against Covid-19: hospitalization (IRR: 0.974), mortality (IRR: 0.975) and lethality for people aged 60 years or older (IRR: 0.997). CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the three epidemic waves and the circulation of variants of concern, the general effect of vaccination against Covid-19 in reducing the trend of morbidity and mortality from the disease in Brazil was demonstrated. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the mass vaccination program against Covid-19 and may inform future public health policies."	"2055-0936

Several measures aimed at containing the spread of this virus have been recommended by international and nation public health institutions, but whether the influenza vaccine, while not protective against COVID-19, nonetheless reduces disease severity is unclear. This study evaluated the potential role of influenza vaccine in reducing the rate of hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 cases recorded in the province of Brindisi (Apulia, Southern Italy) during the first pandemic wave (February-May 2020) and occurring in patients vaccinated with the influenza vaccine during the 2019-2020 influenza season were considered. From February 2020 to May 2020, 3872 inhabitants of the province of Brindisi underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and 664 (8.7%) tested positive. A multivariate analysis showed that among COVID-19 patients neither hospitalization nor death was significantly associated with influenza vaccination (p > 0.05), whereas within this group male sex, older age, and chronic diseases were identified as risk factors for morbidity and mortality. Our study did not show an association between the influenza vaccine and complications of COVID-19. Nonetheless, influenza vaccination must be promoted as a central public health measure, because by reducing the burden on hospitals it can greatly benefit the management of COVID-19 patients."

Vaccine Safety"	"INTRODUCTION: In order to evaluate trends in death after COVID-19 vaccination we analyzed the timing of death relative to vaccination date and the causes of death in vaccinated Utahns in 2021. METHODS: We matched people in the Utah immunization registry with documented COVID-19 vaccinations between December 18, 2020 and December 31, 2021 to Utah's 2021 vital statistics death records. Vaccinated people were categorized as having one, two, or ≥ three COVID-19 vaccine doses in a time-updated metric. We examined crude mortality rates by dosing groups in two-week intervals for all deaths, and by COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 causes, within the 44 weeks following receipt of the most recent vaccine. RESULTS: We identified 2,072,908 individuals who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine of whom 10,997 died in 2021. Only 17.5 % of the total vaccinated population was age 65+, while 80.9 % of those who died were over 65. In the four weeks following the first or second vaccination, all-cause mortality was low and then stabilized for the remainder of the evaluation period at a bi-weekly average of 33.0 and 39.0 deaths/100,000 people for one and two doses, respectively. Typical seasonal variation in death was observed among those with two doses. Small sample size precluded analysis of those with ≥ three doses, but trends were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality rates in the 44 weeks following the COVID-19 vaccination did not show trends suggesting an increase in mortality related to COVID-19 vaccination, reinforcing the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. This represents an accessible approach for local evaluation."	"1873-2518

mRNA vaccination"	"Vaccination against COVID-19 reduces infection-related mortality. Unfortunately, reports of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) in individuals administered adenovirus-vector-based vaccines (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S) have spurred side effect concerns. To address vaccine hesitancy related to this, it is essential to determine the incidence of VITT (defined by a 50% decrease in platelet count and positive anti-PF4 immunoassay within 4-28 days after vaccination) among patients administered two doses of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination. We identified a retrospective cohort of 223,345 patients in the Cleveland Clinic Enterprise administered a COVID-19 vaccine at any location in Northeast Ohio and Florida from 12/4/2020 to 6/6/2021. 97.3% of these patients received an mRNA-based vaccination. Patients with: (1) a serial complete blood count both before and after vaccination and (2) a decrease in platelet count of ≥ 50% were selected for chart review. The primary outcome was the incidence of thrombotic events, including venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thrombosis, 4-28 days post vaccination. Of 74 cohort patients with acute thrombosis, 72 (97.3%) demonstrated clear etiologies, such as active malignancy. Of two patients with unprovoked thrombosis, only one had findings concerning for VITT, with a strongly positive anti-PF4 antibody assay. In this large, multi-state, retrospective cohort, of 223,345 patients (97.2% of whom received the mRNA-based mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 vaccines), we detected a single case that was concerning for VITT in a patient who received an mRNA vaccine. The overwhelming majority of patients with a thrombotic event 4-28 days following vaccination demonstrated clear etiologies."	"1573-742x

myocarditis"	"Background Although rare, classic viral myocarditis in the pediatric population is a disease that carries significant morbidity and mortality. Since 2020, myocarditis has been a common component of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 2021, myocarditis related to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines was recognized as a rare adverse event. This study aims to compare classic, MIS-C, and COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis with regard to clinical presentation, course, and outcomes. Methods and Results In this retrospective cohort study, we compared patients aged <21 years hospitalized at our institution with classic viral myocarditis from 2015 to 2019, MIS-C myocarditis from March 2020 to February 2021, and vaccine-related myocarditis from May 2021 to June 2021. Of 201 total participants, 43 patients had classic myocarditis, 149 had MIS-C myocarditis, and 9 had vaccine-related myocarditis. At presentation, ejection fraction was lowest for those with classic myocarditis, with ejection fraction <55% present in 58% of patients. Nearly all patients with MIS-C myocarditis (n=139, 93%) and all patients with vaccine-related myocarditis (n=9, 100%) had normal left ventricular ejection fraction at the time of discharge compared with 70% (n=30) of the classic myocarditis group (P<0.001). At 3 months after discharge, of the 21 children discharged with depressed ejection fraction, none of the 10 children with MIS-C myocarditis had residual dysfunction compared with 3 of the 11 (27%) patients in the classic myocarditis group. Conclusions Compared with classic myocarditis, those with MIS-C myocarditis had better clinical outcomes, including rapid recovery of cardiac function. Patients with vaccine-related myocarditis had prompt resolution of symptoms and improvement of cardiac function."	"2047-9980

This modeling study simulated the comparative and joint impact of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and coverage with and without non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on total infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. METHODS: An agent-based simulation model was employed to estimate incident SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths over 18 months for the State of North Carolina, a population of roughly 10.5 million. Vaccine efficacy of 50% and 90% and vaccine coverage of 25%, 50%, and 75% (at the end of a 6-month distribution period) were evaluated. Six vaccination scenarios were simulated with NPIs (i.e., reduced mobility, school closings, face mask usage) maintained and removed during the period of vaccine distribution. RESULTS: In the worst-case vaccination scenario (50% efficacy and 25% coverage), 2,231,134 new SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred with NPIs removed and 799,949 infections with NPIs maintained. In contrast, in the best-case scenario (90% efficacy and 75% coverage), there were 450,575 new infections with NPIs maintained and 527,409 with NPIs removed. When NPIs were removed, lower efficacy (50%) and higher coverage (75%) reduced infection risk by a greater magnitude than higher efficacy (90%) and lower coverage (25%) compared to the worst-case scenario (absolute risk reduction 13% and 8%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Simulation results suggest that premature lifting of NPIs while vaccines are distributed may result in substantial increases in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, as NPIs are removed, higher vaccination coverage with less efficacious vaccines can contribute to a larger reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to more efficacious vaccines at lower coverage. Our findings highlight the need for well-resourced and coordinated efforts to achieve high vaccine coverage and continued adherence to NPIs before many pre-pandemic activities can be resumed."

The relative importance of vaccination strategies and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of simulated COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and coverage scenarios with and without NPIs with infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An established agent-based decision analytical model was used to simulate COVID-19 transmission and progression from March 24, 2020, to September 23, 2021. The model simulated COVID-19 spread in North Carolina, a US state of 10.5 million people. A network of 1 017 720 agents was constructed from US Census data to represent the statewide population. EXPOSURES: Scenarios of vaccine efficacy (50% and 90%), vaccine coverage (25%, 50%, and 75% at the end of a 6-month distribution period), and NPIs (reduced mobility, school closings, and use of face masks) maintained and removed during vaccine distribution. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risks of infection from the start of vaccine distribution and risk differences comparing scenarios. Outcome means and SDs were calculated across replications. RESULTS: In the worst-case vaccination scenario (50% efficacy, 25% coverage), a mean (SD) of 2 231 134 (117 867) new infections occurred after vaccination began with NPIs removed, and a mean (SD) of 799 949 (60 279) new infections occurred with NPIs maintained during 11 months. In contrast, in the best-case scenario (90% efficacy, 75% coverage), a mean (SD) of 527 409 (40 637) new infections occurred with NPIs removed and a mean (SD) of 450 575 (32 716) new infections occurred with NPIs maintained. With NPIs removed, lower efficacy (50%) and higher coverage (75%) reduced infection risk by a greater magnitude than higher efficacy (90%) and lower coverage (25%) compared with the worst-case scenario (mean [SD] absolute risk reduction, 13% [1%] and 8% [1%], respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Simulation outcomes suggest that removing NPIs while vaccines are distributed may result in substantial increases in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, as NPIs are removed, higher vaccination coverage with less efficacious vaccines can contribute to a larger reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with more efficacious vaccines at lower coverage. These findings highlight the need for well-resourced and coordinated efforts to achieve high vaccine coverage and continued adherence to NPIs before many prepandemic activities can be resumed."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The primary study aim was to describe the clinical profile and outcome of COVID-19 regarding their vaccination and to identify risk factors for disease progression in vaccinated patients. This was a prospective observational multicentric study of COVID-19 attended by Infectious Disease physicians during January 15, 2022 to February 15, 2022. Adult patients with positive RT-PCR or rapid antigen test for COVID-19 were enrolled. Patient received treatment as per local institutional protocol. Chi square test for categorical and Mann Whitney test for continuous variables were applied for the analysis. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: A total of 788 patients were included in analysis out of 883 enrolled patients from 13 centers across Gujarat. By the end of two weeks' follow up, 22 patients (2.8%) had expired. The Median age of subjects was 54 years, with a (55.8%) male. 90% of the subjects were vaccinated, majority (77%) of them had received 2 doses of vaccine with Covishield (659, 93%). Mortality among the non-vaccinated was significantly (11.4%) higher than vaccinated (1.8%). Logistic regression analysis showed numbers of comorbidities (p ​= ​0.027), baseline higher WBC count (p ​= ​0.02), higher NLR (p ​= ​0.016), and Ct value (p ​= ​0.046) were associated with mortality while vaccination was associated with survival (p ​= ​0.001). The factors associated with mortality among vaccinated were age, comorbidities, baseline higher WBC, NLR, and CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Omicron variant was associated with mild symptoms. Clinical and laboratory risk factors for getting severe disease with Omicron variant were the same with previous SARS CoV-2 strain. Two doses of vaccine protect people against severe disease and death. Age, comorbidities, baseline leucocytosis, high NLR, elevated CRP are the risk factors for poor outcome in vaccinated patients."

Vaccination"	"BACKGROUND: Kidney disease is a key risk factor for COVID-19-related mortality and suboptimal vaccine response. Optimising vaccination strategies is essential to reduce the disease burden in this vulnerable population. We therefore compared the effectiveness of two- and three-dose schedules involving AZD1222 (AZ; ChAdOx1-S) and BNT162b2 (BNT) among people with kidney disease in England. METHODS: With the approval of NHS England, we performed a retrospective cohort study among people with moderate-to-severe kidney disease. Using linked primary care and UK Renal Registry records in the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform, we identified adults with stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease, dialysis recipients, and kidney transplant recipients. We used Cox proportional hazards models to compare COVID-19-related outcomes and non-COVID-19 death after two-dose (AZ-AZ vs BNT-BNT) and three-dose (AZ-AZ-BNT vs BNT-BNT-BNT) schedules. FINDINGS: After two doses, incidence during the Delta wave was higher in AZ-AZ (n = 257,580) than BNT-BNT recipients (n = 169,205; adjusted hazard ratios [95% CIs] 1.43 [1.37-1.50], 1.59 [1.43-1.77], 1.44 [1.12-1.85], and 1.09 [1.02-1.17] for SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, COVID-19-related death, and non-COVID-19 death, respectively). Findings were consistent across disease subgroups, including dialysis and transplant recipients. After three doses, there was little evidence of differences between AZ-AZ-BNT (n = 220,330) and BNT-BNT-BNT recipients (n = 157,065) for any outcome during a period of Omicron dominance. INTERPRETATION: Among individuals with moderate-to-severe kidney disease, two doses of BNT conferred stronger protection than AZ against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease. A subsequent BNT dose levelled the playing field, emphasising the value of heterologous RNA doses in vulnerable populations.

Of the data from 191 countries at the time of data retraction, we selected 111 countries that have SARS-CoV-2 vaccination reports. We stratified countries into high-income and non-high-income countries (HIC and non-HIC) based on World Bank income-group. We used a fixed-effects model (FEM) and performed a longitudinal analysis. The number of confirmed cases decreased as the vaccination rates increased in both non-HICs (B =  - 0.027, T =  - 2.0) and HICs (B =  - 0.207, T =  - 17.5). The number of deaths decreased as the vaccination rates increased in both non-HICs (B =  - 0.151, T =  - 2.3) and HICs (B =  - 0.230, T =  - 40.9). For full vaccination, this measure had a negative association with daily confirmed cases and daily deaths in both non-HICs and HICs. In non-HICs, daily cases and daily deaths decreased as the first vaccination and full vaccination coverages increased. However in HICs, daily cases and daily deaths decreased as the first vaccination and full vaccination coverages increased in the early phase, but after a certain period, they tended to increase again. We observed a significant association between the increase in vaccination coverage in the real world and reduced daily confirmed cases and deaths. However, as the confirmed cases and deaths have rebounded in HICs, our findings indicate that COVID-19 is not completely prevented through vaccine distribution."	"1591-9528

Systematic review"	"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has caused significant morbidity and mortality. Vaccines produced against this virus have proven highly effective. However, adverse events following vaccination have also been reported. One of them is nephrotic syndrome, that can be associated with different pathologic pictures. This review aims to provide a wider understanding of incidence, etiopathogenesis, and management of nephrotic syndrome following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND RESULTS: A literature search was undertaken using appropriate keywords in various databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, Europe PMC, and Science Direct. Twenty-one articles were included following qualitative assessment. Data of 74 patients from these articles were included. DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome following COVID vaccination has been widely attributed to the activation of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors, leading to podocyte effacement. Relapses have also been reported in patients with prior history of nephrotic syndrome following COVID-19 vaccination. A renal biopsy is necessary to identify the histopathological picture. Management of COVID-19 vaccine-induced nephrotic syndrome was mainly reported as successfully attainable with corticosteroids and supportive management. CONCLUSION: Further investigations will help in establishing an early diagnosis and salvaging kidney function."	"1724-6059

We undertook a test-negative control study in Galicia (Northwest Spain) to assess BNT162b2 effectiveness against acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as well as COVID-19 associated hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. A total of 44,401 positive and 817,025 negative SARS-CoV-2 test results belonging to adults were included. Adjusted odds ratios of vaccination and their 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using multivariate logistic-regression models. BNT162b2 showed high effectiveness in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections in all age categories, reaching maximum VE ≥ 14 days after administering the second dose [18-64 years: VE = 92.9% (95%CI: 90.2-95.1); 65-79 years: VE = 85.8% (95%CI: 77.3-91.9), and ≥80 years: VE = 91.4% (95%CI: 87.9-94.1)]. BNT162b2 also demonstrated effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization for all age categories, with VE more pronounced for those aged ≥80 years [VE = 60.0% (95%CI: 49.4-68.3)]. Moreover, there was a considerable reduction in ICU admission [VE = 88.0% (95%CI: 74.6-95.8)] and mortality [VE = 38.0% (95%CI: 15.9-55.4)] in the overall population. BNT162b2 showed substantial protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 severity. Our findings would prove useful for systematic reviews and meta-analysis on COVID-19 VE."	"1660-4601

vaccine effectiveness"	"INTRODUCTION: residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at high risk of adverse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to estimate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of one and two doses of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx-1 against SARS CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related death in residents of LTCFs. METHODS: this observational study used testing, vaccination and mortality data for LTCF residents aged ≥ 65 years who were regularly tested regardless of symptoms from 8 December 2020 to 30 September 2021 in England. Adjusted VE, calculated as one minus adjusted hazard ratio, was estimated using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models for infection and death within 28 days of positive test result. Vaccine status was defined by receipt of one or two doses of vaccine and assessed over a range of intervals. RESULTS: of 197,885 LTCF residents, 47,087 (23.8%) had a positive test and 11,329 (5.8%) died within 28 days of a positive test during the study period. Relative to unvaccinated individuals, VE for infection was highest for ChAdOx-1 at 61% (40-74%) at 1-4 weeks and for BNT162b2 at 69% (52-80%) at 11-15 weeks following the second dose. Against death, VE was highest for ChAdOx-1 at 83% (58-94%) at 1-4 weeks and for BNT162b2 at 91% (75-97%) at 11-15 weeks following second dose. CONCLUSIONS: compared with unvaccinated residents, vaccination with one dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx-1 provided moderate protection against infection and death in residents of LTCFs. Protection against death improved after two doses. However, some waning of protection over time was noted."	"1468-2834

METHODS: Patients with SRD with COVID-19 (vaccinated and unvaccinated) were included by their rheumatologists in a registry operated by the Greek Rheumatology Society in a voluntarily basis. Type, date and doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were recorded, and demographics, type of SRD, concurrent treatment, comorbidities and COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalisation, need for oxygen supplementation and death) were compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. RESULTS: Between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2021, 195 patients with SRD with COVID-19 were included; 147 unvaccinated and 48 vaccinated with at least one dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Pfizer n=38 or AstraZeneca n=10). Among vaccinated patients, 29 developed breakthrough COVID-19 >14 days after the second vaccine dose (fully vaccinated), while 19 between the first and <14 days after the second vaccine dose (partially vaccinated). Despite no differences in demographics, SRD type, treatment or comorbidities between unvaccinated and vaccinated patients, hospitalisation and mortality rates were higher in unvaccinated (29.3% and 4.1%, respectively) compared with partially vaccinated (21% and 0%) or fully vaccinated (10.3% and 0%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinated patients with SRD with breakthrough COVID-19 have better outcomes compared with unvaccinated counterparts with similar disease/treatment characteristics."	"1468-2060

vaccine"	"The Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is a vaccine against the COVID-19 infection that was granted a conditional marketing authorization by the European Commission in January 2021. However, following a report from the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of European Medicines Agency, which reported an association with thrombo-embolic events (TEE), in particular disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), many European countries either limited it to individuals older than 55-60 years or suspended its use. We used publicly available data to carry out a quantitative benefit-risk analysis of the vaccine among people under 60 in Italy. Specifically, we used data from PRAC, Eudravigilance and ECDC to estimate the excess number of deaths for TEE, DIC and CVST expected in vaccine users, stratified by age groups. We then used data from the National Institute of Health to calculate age-specific COVID-19 mortality rates in Italy. Preventable deaths were calculated assuming a 72% vaccine efficacy over an eight-month period. Finally, the benefit-risk ratio of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination was calculated as the ratio of preventable COVID-19 deaths to vaccine-related deaths, using Monte-Carlo simulations. We found that among subjects aged 20-29 years the benefit-risk (B-R) ratio was not clearly favorable (0.70; 95% Uncertainty Interval (UI): 0.27-2.11). However, in the other age groups the benefits of vaccination largely exceeded the risks (for age 30-49, B-R ratio: 22.9: 95%UI: 10.1-186.4). For age 50-59, B-R ratio: 1577.1: 95%UI: 1176.9-2121.5). Although many countries have limited the use of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the benefits of using this vaccine clearly outweigh the risks in people older than 30 years. Study limitations included risk of underreporting and that we did not provide age-specific estimates. The use of this vaccine should be a strategic and fundamental part of the immunization campaign considering its safety and efficacy in preventing COVID-19 and its complications."	"2076-393x

Sociodemographic status, comorbidity, primary care structural characteristics, and HVE-adjusted survival difference between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts in the epidemic period had been computed by Cox regression models, separately for each vaccine (six vaccines were available in Hungary). Hazard ratio (HR) reduction in epidemic period corrected with nonepidemic period’s HR with 95% confidence interval for each vaccine was used to describe the vaccine effectiveness (VE). The whole adult population (N = 6,404,702) of the country was followed in this study (4,026,849 fully vaccinated). Each vaccine could reduce the HVE-corrected all-cause mortality in the epidemic period (VEOxford/AstraZeneca = 0.592 [0.518−0.655], VEJanssen = 0.754 [0.628−0.838], VEModerna = 0.573 [0.526−0.615], VEPfizer-BioNTech = 0.487 [0.461−0.513], VESinopharm = 0.530 [0.496−0.561], and VESputnik V = 0.557 [0.493−0.614]). The HVE-corrected general mortality for COVID-19 vaccine cohorts demonstrated the real-life effectiveness of vaccines applied in Hungary, and the usefulness of this indicator to convince vaccine hesitants."

Although vaccine effectiveness for severe infections is reported to be 89.0%, breakthrough infections are common and may lead to severe outcome in fragile population. We conducted a real-world observational study on 420 COVID-19 admitted patients from July 2021 to January 2022 in a tertiary level Italian hospital. We collected patient's vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 serological status, SARS-CoV-2 treatments, oxygen supports, intensive (ICU) and subintensive (sub-ICU) care unit admissions, length of staying (LoS) and in-hospital mortality. One-hundred-seventy-two vaccinated and 248 unvaccinated patients were admitted during the study period. Vaccinated group (Vg) had a significantly more elevated Charlson Comorbidity Index than Unvaccinated group (UVg), and no statistical differences were found in terms of in-hospital mortality, LoS or ICU and sub-ICU admissions. Among Vg, anti-S antibodies were detected in 86.18% of patients (seropositives). Vaccinated seronegative patients' in-hospital mortality was significantly higher than vaccinated seropositive patients (33.33% vs 10.69%, p = 0.0055): in particular, mortality rate in 45-69 years old population was higher in vaccinated seronegative group, and comparable in patients ≥ 70 years old. No differences in terms of outcome were registered between Vg and UVg, taking into account that Vg was considerably older and with more comorbidities. In line with other recent observations, higher mortality rate was evidenced for seronegative vaccinated patients. Primary prophylaxis and early treatments result to be necessary, especially for older and immunosuppressed populations."	"1970-9366

While COVID-19 vaccines were developed, some studies highlighted a possible relationship between influenza vaccination and lower odds of COVID-19 infection. As obstetric patients belong to a high-risk group for respiratory diseases, this study evaluated whether influenza vaccination reduces the severity of COVID-19 infection and mortality among pregnant and postpartum women. We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 3370 pregnant and postpartum women from the Brazilian national database, where they were grouped according to their influenza vaccination status before the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The intensive care unit admission and intubation rates were significantly higher among subjects in the unvaccinated group (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively). The odds of mortality risk among those who received the vaccine was 0.33, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.23-0.47. The numbers of patients who needed to be vaccinated to avoid a case of intensive care unit admission, intubation, or death due to COVID-19 were 11, 15, and 11, respectively. Influenza vaccines could confer protection against severe COVID-19 infection in pregnant and postpartum women."	"2076-393x

Adult patients with HM, ≥1 dose of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and breakthrough COVID-19 between January 2021 and March 2022 were analyzed. A total of 1548 cases were included, mainly lymphoid malignancies (1181 cases, 76%). After viral sequencing in 753 cases (49%), the Omicron variant was prevalent (517, 68.7%). Most of the patients received ≤2 vaccine doses before COVID-19 (1419, 91%), mostly mRNA-based (1377, 89%). Overall, 906 patients (59%) received COVID-19-specific treatment. After 30-day follow-up from COVID-19 diagnosis, 143 patients (9%) died. The mortality rate in patients with the Omicron variant was 7.9%, comparable to other variants, with a significantly lower 30-day mortality rate than in the prevaccine era (31%). In the univariable analysis, older age (P < .001), active HM (P < .001), and severe and critical COVID-19 (P = .007 and P < .001, respectively) were associated with mortality. Conversely, patients receiving monoclonal antibodies, even for severe or critical COVID-19, had a lower mortality rate (P < .001). In the multivariable model, older age, active disease, critical COVID-19, and 2-3 comorbidities were correlated with a higher mortality, whereas monoclonal antibody administration, alone (P < .001) or combined with antivirals (P = .009), was protective. Although mortality is significantly lower than in the prevaccination era, breakthrough COVID-19 in HM is still associated with considerable mortality. Death rate was lower in patients who received monoclonal antibodies, alone or in combination with antivirals."	"1528-0020

In addition, we determined the factors affecting the COVID-19 severity in vaccinated patients. Patients aged 18-65 years who were hospitalized for COVID-19 between September and December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed in three groups: unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated.A total of 854 patients were included. Mean age was 47.9 ± 10.6 years, 474 patients (55.5%) were male. Of these, 230 patients (26.9%) were fully vaccinated, 97 (11.3%) were partially vaccinated, and 527 (61.7%) were unvaccinated. Of the fully vaccinated patients, 67% (n = 153) were vaccinated with CoronaVac and 33% (n = 77) were vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech. All patients (n = 97) with a single dose were vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech. One hundred thirteen (13.2%) patients were transferred to ICU. A hundred (11.7%) patients were intubated and 77 (9.0%) patients died. Advanced age (P = 0.028, 95% CI = 1.00-1.07, OR = 1.038) and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (P < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.20-1.69, OR = 1.425) were associated with increased mortality, while being fully vaccinated (P = 0.008, 95% CI = 0.23-0.80, OR = 0.435) was associated with survival in multivariate analysis. Full dose vaccination reduced the need for ICU admission by 49.7% (95% CI = 17-70) and mortality by 56.5% (95% CI = 20-77). When the fully vaccinated group was evaluated, we found that death was observed more frequent in patients with CCI>3 (19.1 vs 5.8%, P < 0.01, OR = 3.7). Therefore, the booster vaccine especially in individuals with comorbidities should not be delayed, since the survival expectation is low in patients with a high comorbidity index."	"1588-2640

solid organ transplantation"	"The risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, hospitalization and death, and the effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) is still debated. We performed a nationwide, population-based, matched cohort study, including all Danish SOTRs (n = 5184) and a matched cohort from the general population (n = 41 472). Cox regression analyses were used to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs). SOTRs had a slightly increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and were vaccinated earlier than the general population. The overall risk of hospital contact with COVID-19, severe COVID-19, need for assisted respiration, and hospitalization followed by death was substantially higher in SOTRs (IRR: 32.8 95%CI [29.0-37.0], 9.2 [6.7-12.7], 12.5 [7.6-20.8], 12.4 [7.9-12.7]). The risk of hospitalization and death after SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased substantially in SOTRs after the emergence of the Omicron variant (IRR: 0.45 [0.37-0.56], 0.17 [0.09-0.30]). Three vaccinations reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection only marginally compared to two vaccinations, but SOTRs with three vaccinations had a lower risk of death (IRR: 022 [0.16-0.35]). We conclude that SOTRs have a risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection comparable to the general population, but substantially increased the risk of hospitalization and death following SARS-CoV-2 infection. A third vaccination only reduces the risk of SARS-CoV2 infection marginally, but SOTRs vaccinated 3 times have reduced mortality."	"1600-6143

Currently, few studies have directly compared vaccinated and unvaccinated patients with severe COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU). AIMS: To compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of vaccine recipients and unvaccinated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the ICU in a nationwide setting. METHODS: Data were extracted from the Short PeRiod IncideNce sTudy of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Australia, in 57 ICU during Delta and Omicron predominant periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was inhospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay and ICU mortality. RESULTS: There were 2970 patients admitted to ICU across participating sites from 26 June 2021 to 8 February 2022; 1134 (38.2%) patients were vaccine recipients, and 1836 (61.8%) patients were unvaccinated. Vaccine recipients were older, more comorbid and less likely to require organ support. Unadjusted inhospital mortality was greater in the vaccinated cohort. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbid status, no statistically significant association between inhospital or ICU mortality, and vaccination status, was apparent. CONCLUSION: We found COVID-19 infection can cause severe disease and death in vaccine recipients, though comorbid status and older age were significant contributors to mortality. Organ support requirements and the number of deaths were highest in the unvaccinated cohort."	"1445-5994

Objective: To define the impact of vaccination against COVID-19 in preventing the risk of complications associated with the infection in a cohort of patients with cancer in Colombia. Methods: An analytical observational cohort study, based on national registry of patients with cancer and COVID 19 infection ACHOC-C19, was done. The data was collected from June 2021, until October 2021. Inclusion criteria were: Patients older than 18 years with cancer diagnosis and confirmed COVID-19 infection. Data from the unvaccinated and vaccinated cohorts were compared. Outcomes evaluated included all-cause mortality within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, and need for mechanical ventilation. The estimation of the effect was made through the relative risk (RR), the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and the number needed to treat (NNT). Multivariate analysis was performed using generalized linear models. Results: 896 patients were included, of whom 470 were older than 60 years (52.4%) and 59% were women (n=530). 172 patients were recruited in the vaccinated cohort and 724 in the non-vaccinated cohort (ratio: 1 to 4.2). The cumulative incidence of clinical outcomes among the unvaccinated vs vaccinated patients were: for hospitalization 42% (95% CI: 38.7%-46.1%) vs 29%; (95% CI: 22.4%-36.5%); for invasive mechanical ventilation requirement 8.4% (n=61) vs 4.6% (n=8) and for mortality from all causes 17% (n=123) vs 4.65% (n=8). Conclusion: In our population, unvaccinated patients with cancer have an increased risk of complications for COVID -19 infection, as hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and mortality. It is highly recommended to actively promote the vaccination among this population."	"1837-9664

COVISHIELD from AstraZeneca (AZ), a viral vector vaccine, was the brand administered in the first phase of vaccinations for pre-determined eligible adults 18 years and above. As more brands of COVID-19 vaccines have been introduced in Nigeria, identifying effective and safe vaccine brands is essential to pharmacovigilance and public health. The current study assessed the safety of the AZ-AZD1222 (ChAdOx1) COVID-19 vaccine in adults during the first phase of the vaccination exercise in Nigeria. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a descriptive analysis of safety data from selected vaccination sites across six states in Nigeria between June 2021 and September 2021. Respondents were monitored over 3 months for local and systemic reactions, as well as hospitalisation and mortality. Measures obtained from respondents include age, sex, pre-existing comorbidity, local and systemic reactions to vaccines, timing onset of reactions, hospitalisation and mortality. Bivariate and multivariable regression models were used to assess factors associated with vaccine reactogenicity. RESULTS: A total of 1284 individuals were enrolled in the cohort study from the six selected states (Anambra, Borno, Edo, Katsina, Lagos and Plateau) representing the geopolitical zones of Nigeria. A total of 675 individuals or 52.6% of enrolees reported non-serious adverse effects, and only one individual or 0.08% reported a serious adverse event following immunisation in the first 7 days after vaccination. None of the enrolled participants reported adverse events requiring hospitalisation. The most common self-reported symptoms amongst vaccine recipients were tenderness at the injection site 20.9% and fever 20.3%. A majority of symptoms (55.5%) occurred on or before the 3(rd) day after vaccination. Multivariable logistic regression model showed that age 60 years or above (vs. 18-24 years) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of a vaccine-related symptomatic reaction (adjusted odds ratio: 0.35; 95% confidence interval: 0.20-0.61). There was no reported mortality amongst all the enrolled and followed-up vaccine recipients. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the safety profile of the AZ vaccine is acceptable, and the observed symptoms were mild and mostly within the first 3 days following vaccination. Vaccine recipients will benefit from counselling about potential transient reactions, and improving public awareness can potentially encourage the uptake of vaccines and reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic."

Despite their safety profiles, vaccines, as with any other medical product, can cause adverse events. Yet, in countries with poor epidemiological surveillance and monitoring systems, reporting vaccine-related adverse events is a challenge. The objective of this study was to describe self-reported vaccine adverse events after receiving one of the available COVID-19 vaccine schemes in Ecuador. A cross-sectional analysis based on an online, self-reported, 32-item questionnaire was conducted in Ecuador from 1 April to 15 July 2021. Participants were invited by social media, radio, and TV to voluntarily participate in our study. A total of 6654 participants were included in this study. Furthermore, 38.2% of the participants reported having at least one comorbidity. Patients received AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Sinovac vaccines, and these were distributed 38.4%, 31.1%, and 30.5%, respectively. Overall, pain or swelling at the injection site 17.2% (n = 4500) and headache 13.3% (n = 3502) were the most reported adverse events. Women addressed events supposedly attributable to vaccination or immunization [ESAVIs] (66.7%), more often than men (33.2%). After receiving the first dose of any available COVID-19 vaccine, a total of 19,501 self-reported ESAVIs were informed (87.0% were mild, 11.5% moderate, and 1.5% severe). In terms of the vaccine type and brand, the most reactogenic vaccine was AstraZeneca with 57.8%, followed by Pfizer (24.9%) and Sinovac (17.3%). After the second dose, 6776 self-reported ESAVIs were reported (87.1% mild, 10.9% moderate, and 2.1% severe). AstraZeneca vaccine users reported a higher proportion of ESAVIs (72.2%) in comparison to Pfizer/BioNTech (15.9%) and Sinovac Vaccine (11.9%). Swelling at the injection site, headache, muscle pain, and fatigue were the most common ESAVIs for the first as well as second doses. In conclusion, most ESAVIs were mild. AstraZeneca users were more likely to report adverse events. Participants without a history of COVID-19 infection, as well as those who received the first dose, were more prone to report ESAVIs."

Hungary offers an example to investigate whether social inequalities compromise what a successful vaccine program can achieve. COVID-19 morbidity, mortality, and vaccination coverage were characterized by calculation of indirectly standardized ratios in the Hungarian population during the third pandemic wave at the level of municipalities, classified into deprivation quintiles. Then, their association with socioeconomic deprivation was assessed using ecological regression. Compared to the national average, people living in the most deprived municipalities had a 15-24% lower relative incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases, but a 17-37% higher relative mortality and a 38% lower vaccination coverage. At an ecological level, COVID-19 mortality showed a strong positive association with deprivation and an inverse association with vaccination coverage (RR(Vaccination) = 0.86 (0.75-0.98)), but the latter became non-significant after adjustment for deprivation (RR(Vaccination) = 0.95 (0.84-1.09), RR(Deprivation) = 1.10 (1.07-1.14)). Even what is widely viewed as one of the more successful vaccine roll outs was unable to close the gap in COVID-19 mortality during the third pandemic wave in Hungary. This is likely to be due to the challenges of reaching those living in the most deprived municipalities who experienced the highest mortality rates during the third wave."	"2075-4426

Data on deaths due to severe acute respiratory syndrome by COVID-19 were obtained from the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System. Deaths were evaluated from January 10, 2021 to February 12, 2022, grouped into Epidemiological Weeks (EW). Data analysis was conducted in the R software, using Poisson models to estimate mortality rates. Statistical significance level was set at 5%. A total of 408,180 deaths were evaluated, 0.34% of whom were under 18 years old, and 64.6% of whom were 60 years old and over. On the one hand, in the 0-1, 2-4 and 5-11 age groups, higher mortality rates were observed in EW 4-6/2022, compared to the higher ones in 2021. On the other, in the 12-17 age group, a lower rate was estimated in the EW 4-6/2022 group compared to the EW 11-13 group in 2021, with a mortality ratio of 0.60 (95%CI: 0.38-0.94). Opposing patterns were detected in COVID-19 mortality in Brazil among children and individuals included in the national vaccination campaign. Among the former, mortality rates equal to or worse than in previous phases of the epidemic were observed, contrasting with the consistent and strong decline registered in the latter, reinforcing the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines."

epilepsy"	"OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy is a non-communicable disease costing a massive burden globally. It is known that there is increased prevalence of morbidity and mortality following COVID-19 infection among people with epilepsy (PWE). However, there is limited information about the adverse events following COVID-19 immunization among PWE. Hence, this study aimed to assess the safety and adverse events following immunization (AEFI) of various COVID-19 vaccines among PWE from our centre, focusing on neurological AEFI. METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 120 adult PWE from the Neurology Clinic of the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC). Consent-taking was conducted via synchronous or asynchronous approaches, followed by a phone call interview session. The interview collected socio-demographic information, epilepsy-related variables, and vaccination-related variables. Univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis were done to confirm factors associated with the AEFI of COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Among all types of COVID-19 vaccines, most of the PWE received the Cominarty® COVID-19 vaccination (52.5%). Overall, local AEFI was the quickest to develop, with an average onset within a day. PWE with normal body mass index (BMI) had a higher risk of developing both local and systemic AEFI compared to those underweight and obese PWE (OR: 15.09, 95% CI 1.70-134.28, P = 0.02). SIGNIFICANCE: COVID-19 vaccines are safe for PWE. AEFI among PWE are similar to those of the general population following COVID-19 vaccination. Therefore, clinicians should encourage PWE to take COVID-19 vaccines."	"2470-9239

With the same epidemiological and vaccine information, the results of this three different mathematical models point in the same direction: combined with physical distancing, staggered vaccination, starting with the high risk groups, would prevent 60% of infections, 42% of hospitalizations and 60% of mortality in the population. These models, which can be adapted to the new available scientific evidence, are dynamic and powerful tools for the evaluation and adjustment of immunization programs, promoting research on this field, and helping to achieve more efficient results in health."

Vaccines"	"BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy - a delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability - has the potential to threaten the successful roll-out of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines globally. In this study, we aim to understand the likely impact of vaccine hesitancy on the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We modelled the potential impact of vaccine hesitancy on the control of the pandemic and the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) by combining an epidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission with data on vaccine hesitancy from population surveys. RESULTS: Our simulations suggest that the mortality over a 2-year period could be up to 7.6 times higher in countries with high vaccine hesitancy compared to an ideal vaccination uptake if NPIs are relaxed. Alternatively, high vaccine hesitancy could prolong the need for NPIs to remain in place. CONCLUSIONS: While vaccination is an individual choice, vaccine-hesitant individuals have a substantial impact on the pandemic trajectory, which may challenge current efforts to control COVID-19. In order to prevent such outcomes, addressing vaccine hesitancy with behavioural interventions is an important priority in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic."	"2730-664x

The aim of the study was to investigate whether vaccination and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have modified the outcomes of HM patients with COVID-19. This is a single-centre retrospective study in HM patients hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 2020 to April 2022. Patients were divided into PRE-V-mAb group (patients hospitalized before the introduction of vaccination and mAbs) and POST-V-mAb group (patients hospitalized after the use of vaccine and mAbs). A total of 126 patients were included (65 PRE-V-mAb and 61 POST-V-mAb). POST-V-mAb patients showed a significantly lower risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (8.2% vs. 27.7%, p = 0.005), shorter viral shedding [17 (IQR 10-28) vs. 24 days (IQR 15-50), p = 0.011] and shorter hospitalization length [13 (IQR 7-23) vs. 20 (IQR 14-41) days, p = 0.0003] compared to the PRE-V-mAb group. Nevertheless, both in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates did not significantly differ between the two groups (29.5% POST-V-mAb vs. 36.9% PRE-V-mAb and 21.3% POST-V-mAb vs. 29.2% PRE-V-mAb, respectively). At the multivariable analysis, an active malignancy (p = 0.042), a critical COVID-19 at admission (p = 0.025) and the need for high-level of oxygen support at respiratory worsening [either HFNC/CPAP (p = 0.022) or mechanical ventilation (p = 0.011)] were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. In the subgroup of POST-V-mAb patients, receiving therapy with mAbs was a protective factor (p = 0.033). Despite the new therapeutic and preventive strategies available, HM patients with COVID-19 disease represent an extremely vulnerable group with still high mortality rates."	"1591-9528

In this ecological study of 140 countries using publicly available national-level data, higher vaccine coverage, representing estimated proportion of people vaccinated during the last 14 years, was associated with lower COVID-19 deaths. The associations attenuated for both vaccine variables, and MCV coverage became no longer significant once adjusted for published estimates of the Healthcare access and quality index (HAQI), a validated summary score of healthcare quality indicators. The magnitude of association between BCG coverage and COVID-19 death rate varied according to HAQI, and MCV coverage had little effect on the association between BCG and COVID-19 deaths. While there are associations between live vaccine coverage and COVID-19 outcomes, the vaccine coverage variables themselves were strongly correlated with COVID-19 testing rate, HAQI and life expectancy. This suggests that the population-level associations may be further confounded by differences in structural health systems and policies. Cluster randomised studies of booster vaccines would be ideal to evaluate the efficacy of trained immunity in preventing COVID-19 infections and mortality in vaccinated populations and on community transmission."

We aim to characterize the outcomes and the impact of underlying heart diseases after surviving COVID-19 hospitalization. METHODS: We conducted an analysis of the prospective registry HOPE-2 (Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for COVID-19-2, NCT04778020). We selected patients discharged alive and considered the primary end-point all-cause mortality during follow-up. As secondary main end-points, we included any readmission or any post-COVID-19 symptom. Clinical features and follow-up events are compared between those with and without cardiovascular disease. Factors with p < 0.05 in the univariate analysis were entered into the multivariate analysis to determine independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: HOPE-2 closed on 31 December 2021, with 9299 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and 1805 died during this acute phase. Finally, 7014 patients with heart disease data were included in the present analysis, from 56 centers in 8 countries. Heart disease (+) patients were older (73 vs. 58 years old), more frequently male (63 vs. 56%), had more comorbidities than their counterparts, and suffered more frequently from post-COVID-19 complications and higher mortality (OR (heart disease): 2.63, 95% CI: 1.81-3.84). Vaccination was found to be an independent protector factor (HR (all-cause death): 0.09; 95% CI: 0.04-0.19). CONCLUSIONS: After surviving the acute phase, patients with underlying heart disease continue to present a more complex clinical profile and worse outcomes including increased mortality. The COVID-19 vaccine could benefit survival in patients with heart disease during follow-up."	"2077-0383

The purpose of this paper is to compare COVID-19 mortality trends in the US prison population and the general population to see how mortality risk changed over the course of the pandemic. The authors first provide a national overview of trends in COVID-19 mortality; then, the authors assess COVID-19 deaths among older populations using more detailed data from one US state. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The authors used multiple publicly available data sets (e.g. Centers for Disease Control and prevention, COVID Prison Project) and indirect and direct standardization to estimate standardized mortality rates covering the period from April 2020 to June 2021 for the US and for the State of Texas. FINDINGS: While 921 COVID-19-related deaths among people in US prisons were expected as of June 5, 2021, 2,664 were observed, corresponding to a standardized mortality ratio of 2.89 (95%CI 2.78, 3.00). The observed number of COVID-19-related deaths exceeded the expected number of COVID-19-related deaths among people in prison for most of the pandemic, with a substantially widening gap leading to a plateau about four weeks after the COVID-19 vaccine was introduced in the USA. In the state population, the older population in prison is dying at younger ages compared with the general population, with the highest percentage of deaths among people aged 50-64 years. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: People who are incarcerated are dying of COVID-19 at a rate that far outpaces the general population and are dying at younger ages. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This descriptive analysis serves as a first step in understanding the dynamic trends in COVID-19 mortality and the association between age and COVID-19 death in US prisons."

STUDY DESIGN: Aggregate data analysis. METHODS: Annual period life tables were used to estimate sex-specific LEs within provinces from 2019 to 2022. We used Arriaga decomposition to analyze the contribution of age groups (<60 years and ≥60 years) to annual LE changes. We implemented a Quasi-Poisson regression model to estimate the number of averted deaths by the achieved COVID-19 vaccination rates from January 2021 up to December 2022, simulating a counterfactual scenario where vaccine doses were not administered. RESULTS: The results revealed geographical heterogeneity in annual LE changes across Italian provinces during the pandemic. By the end of 2022, LE was below the prepandemic levels in 88% of provinces for females and in 76% for males. In addition, we estimated that the achieved vaccination rates averted 460,831 deaths (95% confidence interval: 250,976-707,920), corresponding to a 25% reduction in expected all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the study highlighted the significant role of COVID-19 vaccinations in averting a considerable number of deaths and improving LE. However, by the end of 2022, LE had not fully recovered to prepandemic levels in many provinces. This could be attributed to concurrent factors, including enduring COVID-19 pandemic effects, intense summer heat waves and early onset of seasonal flu. Further research and continuous monitoring are essential to fully comprehend long-term mortality trends and optimize public health strategies."	"1476-5616

METHODS: Two matched cohorts were formed using Swedish nationwide registers. In the first, residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) given a fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine from 1 January 2022 onwards were matched 1:1 on birth year and county of residence to residents given at least a third dose (N = 24,524). In the second, all individuals aged ≥80 years given a fourth dose were matched 1:1 to individuals given at least a third dose (N = 394,104). Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in fourth-dose recipients as compared with in third-dose recipients, with relative vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimated as 1 minus the hazard ratio. FINDINGS: From 7 days after baseline and onwards, there were 1119 deaths in the LTCF cohort during a median follow-up of 77 days and a maximum follow-up of 126 days. During days 7 to 60, the VE of the fourth dose was 39% (95% CI, 29-48), which declined to 27% (95% CI, -2-48) during days 61 to 126. In the cohort of all individuals aged ≥80 years, there were 5753 deaths during a median follow-up of 73 days and a maximum follow-up of 143 days. During days 7 to 60, the VE of the fourth dose was 71% (95% CI, 69-72), which declined to 54% (95% CI, 48-60) during days 61 to 143. The VE of the fourth dose seemed stronger when it was compared to third-dose recipients where at least four months had passed since vaccination (P < 0·001 for interaction). INTERPRETATION: As compared with a third dose, a fourth dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, administered during the Omicron era, was associated with reduced risk of death from all causes in residents of LTCFs and in the oldest old during the first two months, after which the protection became slightly lower. These findings suggest that a fourth dose may prevent premature mortality in the oldest and frailest even after the emergence of the Omicron variant, although the timing of vaccination seems to be important with respect to the slight waning observed after two months.

We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against the risk of infection, hospitalisation, and death during the first 9 months after vaccination for the total population of Sweden. METHODS: This retrospective, total population cohort study was done using data from Swedish nationwide registers. The cohort comprised all individuals vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, mRNA-1273, or BNT162b2, and matched unvaccinated individuals, with data on vaccinations and infections updated until Oct 4, 2021. Two outcomes were evaluated. The first was SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity from Jan 12 to Oct 4, 2021. The second was severe COVID-19, defined as hospitalisation for COVID-19 or all-cause 30-day mortality after confirmed infection, from March 15 to Sept 28, 2021. FINDINGS: Between Dec 28, 2020, and Oct 4, 2021, 842 974 individuals were fully vaccinated (two doses), and were matched (1:1) to an equal number of unvaccinated individuals (total study cohort n=1 685 948). For the outcome SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity, the vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 waned progressively over time, from 92% (95% CI 92 to 93; p<0·001) at 15-30 days, to 47% (39 to 55; p<0·001) at 121-180 days, and to 23% (-2 to 41; p=0·07) from day 211 onwards. Waning was slightly slower for mRNA-1273, with a vaccine effectiveness of 96% (94 to 97; p<0·001) at 15-30 days and 59% (18 to 79; p=0·012) from day 181 onwards. Waning was also slightly slower for heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 plus an mRNA vaccine, for which vaccine effectiveness was 89% (79 to 94; p<0·001) at 15-30 days and 66% (41 to 80; p<0·001) from day 121 onwards. By contrast, vaccine effectiveness for homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was 68% (52 to 79; p<0·001) at 15-30 days, with no detectable effectiveness from day 121 onwards (-19% [-98 to 28]; p=0·49). For the outcome of severe COVID-19, vaccine effectiveness waned from 89% (82 to 93; p<0·001) at 15-30 days to 64% (44 to 77; p<0·001) from day 121 onwards. Overall, there was some evidence for lower vaccine effectiveness in men than in women and in older individuals than in younger individuals. INTERPRETATION: We found progressively waning vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity across all subgroups, but the rate of waning differed according to vaccine type. With respect to severe COVID-19, vaccine effectiveness seemed to be better maintained, although some waning became evident after 4 months. The results strengthen the evidence-based rationale for administration of a third vaccine dose as a booster. FUNDING: None."	"1474-547x

At our institution, patients may receive liver transplant (LTx) regardless of vaccine status. The purpose of this study is to compare post-LTx outcomes between vaccinated (VAX) and unvaccinated (UNVAX) LTx recipients. METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-center study of LTx from January 1, 2021-March 30, 2022. The primary outcome is incidence of post-LTx COVID-19. Secondary outcomes include graft function, mortality, graft loss, and COVID-19 treatment. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-seven LTx recipients were included, 57% [101/177] VAX and 43% [76/177] UNVAX. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Overall, 28 (36.8%) UNVAX and 34 (33.7%) VAX tested COVID-19 positive during the study period (p = .193) at a mean of 312.6 [255.4-369.8] days for UNVAX versus 254.6 [215.2-293.9] days for VAX (p = .084). COVID-19 treatment was administered in 15 (53.6%) of the UNVAX compared to 22 (64.7%) in the VAX (p = .374), although eight (28.6%) of UNVAX required hospital admission for treatment compared with two (5.9%) of VAX (p = .016). There were no statistically significant differences in death, and no COVID-19 related death or graft loss. There were no statistically significant differences in liver function tests at 3- and 12-months post LTx. CONCLUSION: In a series with a large percentage of UNVAX patients, LTx appears to be safe, with no difference in the rate of COVID-19 or transplant-related outcomes compared to VAX. While we encourage vaccination to prevent severe COVID, based on our results, vaccine status should not be reason to deny lifesaving transplant."	"1399-0012

A total of 3351 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Memorial Healthcare System from June 1-September 20, 2021, were included, of whom 284 (8.5%) were fully vaccinated. A propensity score-matched analysis was conducted to compare fully vaccinated patients to controls who were not vaccinated. Propensity scores were calculated based on variables associated with vaccination status. A 1:1 matching ratio was applied using logistic regression models, ensuring balanced characteristics between the two groups. The matched samples were then subjected to multivariate analysis. Among breakthrough infections, vaccinated patients demonstrated lower incidences of ICU admission (10.3% vs. 16.4%, P = .042) and death (12.2% vs. 18.7%, P = .041) compared to the matched controls. Risk-adjusted multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant inverse association between vaccination and ICU admission (OR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.31-0.89; P = .019) as well as in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.34-0.94; P = .027). Vaccinated individuals experiencing breakthrough infections had significantly lower risks of ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. The findings highlight the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines in reducing severe outcomes in patients with breakthrough infections."	"1476-6256

The present study aimed to identify the risk factors associated with worse outcomes in cancer patients with Covid-19 in both first infection and reinfection and to describe the involvement of vaccines in reinfection outcome. The present study enrolled 85 patients with solid tumors who had Covid-19 infection and had not been previously vaccinated. Classical risk factors associated with worse outcomes in cancer patients with second SARS-Cov infection were considered. The patients were followed up retrospectively, measuring mortality at the first and second infection and the vaccination rate after the first infection. The factors associated with the highest risk of mortality at the first infection were, in order of importance: intensive care unit (ICU) admission, unfavorable performance status, radiologically quantifiable presence of oncological disease, and administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the period immediately before infection. The risk factors associated with higher mortality from reinfection were ECOG 3-4 performance status and administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the period immediately before infection. In the studied patients, mortality from reinfection was not affected by prior vaccination. Thus, bearing in mind all of these risk factors for poor outcomes in cancer patients with solid tumors presenting with Covid-19 can help the treating oncologists make personalized decisions about patient care during the pandemic."

Vaccine Efficacy"	"INTRODUCTION: Real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates are essential to identify potential groups at higher risk of break-through infections and to guide policy. We assessed the VE of COVID-19 vaccination against COVID-19 hospitalization, while adjusting and stratifying for patient characteristics. METHODS: We performed a test-negative case-control study in six Dutch hospitals. The study population consisted of adults eligible for COVID-19 vaccination hospitalized between May 1 and June 28, 2021 with respiratory symptoms. Cases were defined as patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR during the first 48 h of admission or within 14 days prior to hospital admission. Controls were patients tested negative at admission and did not have a positive test during the 2 weeks prior to hospitalization. VE was calculated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for calendar week, sex, age, comorbidity and nursing home residency. Subgroup analysis was performed for age, sex and different comorbidities. Secondary endpoints were ICU-admission and mortality. RESULTS: 379 cases and 255 controls were included of whom 157 (18%) were vaccinated prior to admission. Five cases (1%) and 40 controls (16%) were fully vaccinated (VE: 93%; 95% CI: 81 - 98), and 40 cases (11%) and 70 controls (27%) were partially vaccinated (VE: 70%; 95% CI: 50-82). A strongly protective effect of vaccination was found in all comorbidity subgroups. No ICU-admission or mortality were reported among fully vaccinated cases. Of unvaccinated cases, mortality was 10% and 19% was admitted at the ICU. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccination provides a strong protective effect against COVID-19 related hospital admission, in patients with and without comorbidity."	"1873-2518

Vaccination
Virus variant"	"Vaccination is considered as the ultimate weapon to end the pandemic. However, the role of vaccines in the pandemic remains controversial. To explore the impact of vaccination on the COVID-19 pandemic, we used logistic regression models to predict numbers of population-adjusted confirmed cases, deaths, intensive care unit (ICU) cases, case fatality rates and ICU admission rates of COVID-19 in the 50 U.S. states, based on 17 related variables. The logistic regression analysis showed that percentages of people vaccinated correlated inversely with the numbers of COVID-19 deaths and case fatality rates but showed no significant correlation with numbers of confirmed cases or ICU cases, or ICU admission rates. The Spearman correlation analysis showed that the percentages of people vaccinated correlated inversely with the numbers of COVID-19 deaths, ICU cases, ICU case rates, and case fatality rates but showed no significant correlation with numbers of confirmed cases. The number of deaths and mortality in the group after the vaccine usage were significantly lower than those in the group before the vaccine usage. However, after delta became the dominant strain, there were no longer significant differences in the number of deaths and the mortality rate between before and after delta became the dominant strain, although vaccines were used in both periods. Vaccination can significantly reduce COVID-19 deaths and mortality, while it cannot reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection. In addition to vaccination, other measures, such as social distancing, remain important in containing COVID-19 transmission and lower the risk of COVID-19 severe outcomes."	"2001-0370

We recorded COVID-19 admission volumes, CVT hospitalization, and CVT in-hospital mortality from January 1, 2019, to May 31, 2021. CVT diagnoses were identified by International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) codes or stroke databases. We additionally sought to compare the same metrics in the first 5 months of 2021 compared to the corresponding months in 2019 and 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04934020). RESULTS: There were 2,313 CVT admissions across the 1-year pre-pandemic (2019) and pandemic year (2020); no differences in CVT volume or CVT mortality were observed. During the first 5 months of 2021, there was an increase in CVT volumes compared to 2019 (27.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 24.2 to 32.0; P<0.0001) and 2020 (41.4%; 95% CI, 37.0 to 46.0; P<0.0001). A COVID-19 diagnosis was present in 7.6% (132/1,738) of CVT hospitalizations. CVT was present in 0.04% (103/292,080) of COVID-19 hospitalizations. During the first pandemic year, CVT mortality was higher in patients who were COVID positive compared to COVID negative patients (8/53 [15.0%] vs. 41/910 [4.5%], P=0.004). There was an increase in CVT mortality during the first 5 months of pandemic years 2020 and 2021 compared to the first 5 months of the pre-pandemic year 2019 (2019 vs. 2020: 2.26% vs. 4.74%, P=0.05; 2019 vs. 2021: 2.26% vs. 4.99%, P=0.03). In the first 5 months of 2021, there were 26 cases of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), resulting in six deaths. CONCLUSIONS: During the 1st year of the COVID-19 pandemic, CVT hospitalization volume and CVT in-hospital mortality did not change compared to the prior year. COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with higher CVT in-hospital mortality. During the first 5 months of 2021, there was an increase in CVT hospitalization volume and increase in CVT-related mortality, partially attributable to VITT."	"2287-6405

Vaccine-derived herd immunity
Waning immunity"	"The effectiveness of control interventions against COVID-19 is threatened by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. We present a mathematical model for studying the transmission dynamics of two of these variants (Delta and Omicron) in the United States, in the presence of vaccination, treatment of individuals with clinical symptoms of the disease and the use of face masks. The model is parameterized and cross-validated using observed daily case data for COVID-19 in the United States for the period from November 2021 (when Omicron first emerged) to March 2022. Rigorous qualitative analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium of the model is locally-asymptotically stable when the control reproduction number of the model (denoted by Rc ) is less than one. This equilibrium is shown to be globally-asymptotically stable for a special case of the model, where disease-induced mortality is negligible and both vaccine-derived immunity in fully-vaccinated individuals and natural immunity do not wane, when the associated reproduction number is less than one. The epidemiological implication of the latter result is that the combined vaccination-boosting strategy can lead to the elimination of the pandemic if its implementation can bring (and maintain) the associated reproduction number to a value less than one. An analytical expression for the vaccine-derived herd immunity threshold is derived. Using this expression, together with the baseline values of the parameters of the parameterized model, we showed that the vaccine-derived herd immunity can be achieved in the United States (so that the pandemic will be eliminated) if at least 68% of the population is fully-vaccinated with two of the three vaccines approved for use in the United States (Pfizer or Moderna vaccine). Furthermore, this study showed (as of the time of writing in March 2022) that the control reproduction number of the Omicron variant was approximately 3.5 times that of the Delta variant (the reproduction of the latter is computed to be  ≈ 0.2782 ), indicating that Delta had practically died out and that Omicron has competitively-excluded Delta (to become the predominant variant in the United States). Based on our analysis and parameterization at the time of writing of this paper (March 2022), our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 elimination is feasible by June 2022 if the current baseline level of the coverage of fully-vaccinated individuals is increased by about 20% . The prospect of pandemic elimination is significantly improved if vaccination is combined with a face mask strategy that prioritizes moderately effective and high-quality masks. Having a high percentage of the populace wearing the moderately-effective surgical mask is more beneficial to the community than having low percentage of the populace wearing the highly-effective N95 masks. We showed that waning natural and vaccine-derived immunity (if considered individually) offer marginal impact on disease burden, except for the case when they wane at a much faster rate (e.g., within three months), in comparison to the baseline (estimated to be within 9 months to a year). Treatment of symptomatic individuals has marginal effect in reducing daily cases of SARS-CoV-2, in comparison to the baseline, but it has significant impact in reducing daily hospitalizations. Furthermore, while treatment significantly reduces daily hospitalizations (and, consequently, deaths), the prospects of COVID-19 elimination in the United States are significantly enhanced if investments in control resources are focused on mask usage and vaccination rather than on treatment."

We performed a prospective analysis of the Vax-On-Third study to investigate the effects of antibody response on immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and disease outcomes. METHODS: Recipients of the booster dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-BNT162b2 vaccine who had received at least one course of an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment before vaccination for an advanced solid malignancy were eligible. RESULTS: The current analysis included 56 patients with metastatic disease (median age: 66 years; male: 71%), most of whom had a lung cancer diagnosis and were being treated with pembrolizumab- or nivolumab-based regimens. The optimal cut-point antibody titer of 486 BAU/mL allowed a dichotomization of recipients into low-responders (Low-R, < 486 BAU/mL) or high-responders (High-R, ≥ 486 BAU/mL). After a median follow-up time of 226 days, 21.4% of patients experienced moderate to severe irAEs without any recrudescence of immune toxicities preceding the booster dose. The frequencies of irAE before and after the third dose did not differ, but an increase in the cumulative incidence of immuno-related thyroiditis was observed within the High-R subgroup. On multivariate analysis, an enhanced humoral response correlated with a better outcome in terms of durable clinical benefit, which resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of disease control loss but not mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings would strengthen the recommendation not to change anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment plans based on current or future immunization schedules, implying that all these patients should be closely monitored."

Among members aged ≥12 years of a large integrated health care delivery system in Oregon and Washington, incidence of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospitalizations were calculated by COVID-19 vaccination status, vaccine product, age, race, and ethnicity. Infection after full vaccination was defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test result ≥14 days after completion of an authorized COVID-19 vaccination series.* During the July-September 2021 surveillance period, SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred among 4,146 of 137,616 unvaccinated persons (30.1 per 1,000 persons) and 3,009 of 344,848 fully vaccinated persons (8.7 per 1,000). Incidence was higher among unvaccinated persons than among vaccinated persons across all demographic strata. Unvaccinated persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection were more than twice as likely to receive ED care (18.5%) or to be hospitalized (9.0%) than were vaccinated persons with COVID-19 (8.1% and 3.9%, respectively). The crude mortality rate was also higher among unvaccinated patients (0.43 per 1,000) than in fully vaccinated patients (0.06 per 1,000). These data support CDC recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination, including additional and booster doses, to protect individual persons and communities against COVID-19, including illness and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant (1)."

We use national, linked electronic health data in England to assess the impact of COVID-19 vaccination and positive SARS-CoV-2 tests on the risk of cardiac and all-cause mortality in young people (12 to 29 years) using a self-controlled case series design. Here, we show there is no significant increase in cardiac or all-cause mortality in the 12 weeks following COVID-19 vaccination compared to more than 12 weeks after any dose. However, we find an increase in cardiac death in women after a first dose of non mRNA vaccines. A positive SARS-CoV-2 test is associated with increased cardiac and all-cause mortality among people vaccinated or unvaccinated at time of testing."	"2041-1723

We aimed to describe trends in absolute and relative COVID-19-related mortality risks across clinical and demographic population subgroups during successive SARS-CoV-2 pandemic waves. Methods We did a retrospective cohort study in England using the OpenSAFELY platform with the approval of National Health Service England, covering the first five SARS-CoV-2 pandemic waves (wave one [wild-type] from March 23 to May 30, 2020; wave two [alpha (B.1.1.7)] from Sept 7, 2020, to April 24, 2021; wave three [delta (B.1.617.2)] from May 28 to Dec 14, 2021; wave four [omicron (B.1.1.529)] from Dec 15, 2021, to April 29, 2022; and wave five [omicron] from June 24 to Aug 3, 2022). In each wave, we included people aged 18–110 years who were registered with a general practice on the first day of the wave and who had at least 3 months of continuous general practice registration up to this date. We estimated crude and sex-standardised and age-standardised wave-specific COVID-19-related death rates and relative risks of COVID-19-related death in population subgroups. Findings 18 895 870 adults were included in wave one, 19 014 720 in wave two, 18 932 050 in wave three, 19 097 970 in wave four, and 19 226 475 in wave five. Crude COVID-19-related death rates per 1000 person-years decreased from 4·48 deaths (95% CI 4·41–4·55) in wave one to 2·69 (2·66–2·72) in wave two, 0·64 (0·63–0·66) in wave three, 1·01 (0·99–1·03) in wave four, and 0·67 (0·64–0·71) in wave five. In wave one, the standardised COVID-19-related death rates were highest in people aged 80 years or older, people with chronic kidney disease stage 5 or 4, people receiving dialysis, people with dementia or learning disability, and people who had received a kidney transplant (ranging from 19·85 deaths per 1000 person-years to 44·41 deaths per 1000 person-years, compared with from 0·05 deaths per 1000 person-years to 15·93 deaths per 1000 person-years in other subgroups). In wave two compared with wave one, in a largely unvaccinated population, the decrease in COVID-19-related mortality was evenly distributed across population subgroups. In wave three compared with wave one, larger decreases in COVID-19-related death rates were seen in groups prioritised for primary SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, including people aged 80 years or older and people with neurological disease, learning disability, or severe mental illness (90–91% decrease). Conversely, smaller decreases in COVID-19-related death rates were observed in younger age groups, people who had received organ transplants, and people with chronic kidney disease, haematological malignancies, or immunosuppressive conditions (0–25% decrease). In wave four compared with wave one, the decrease in COVID-19-related death rates was smaller in groups with lower vaccination coverage (including younger age groups) and conditions associated with impaired vaccine response, including people who had received organ transplants and people with immunosuppressive conditions (26–61% decrease). Interpretation There was a substantial decrease in absolute COVID-19-related death rates over time in the overall population, but demographic and clinical relative risk profiles persisted and worsened for people with lower vaccination coverage or impaired immune response. Our findings provide an evidence base to inform UK public health policy for protecting these vulnerable population subgroups.

The rapid development and deployment of vaccines almost a year after the initial outbreak was poised to contain the pandemic and enable the mobilization of the people and the economy. Vaccine deployment and containment of the pandemic have been far from uniform across the world. There is a lack of a clear understanding of the correlation between the COVID-19 vaccination rates and the incidence of the COVID-19 disease and COVID-19 mortality. AIM:  The study aims to determine the correlation between the COVID-19 vaccination rate and the bi-weekly incidence rate of the COVID-19 disease to better understand the correlation between the vaccination rate and the COVID-19-related fatality in various countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Data from vaccination and the case fatality rate were abstracted until September 15, 2021, and from October 15 to October 31, respectively, for the various countries categorized based on their income levels. The bi-weekly COVID-19 incidence rate per million population and the case fatality rate was analyzed using SPSS version 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), followed by frequencies and percentages. Spearman rank correlation was used to determine the relationship between the variables. RESULTS:  A total of 191 countries were included in the study. The vaccination rate ranged from 0.03% to 82.1%, CFR from 0.14% to 32.1%, and the bi-weekly incidence rate ranged from zero to 1,283 per million population. A positive correlation was observed between vaccination rate and bi-weekly incidence rate (+0.57), whereas a negative correlation was observed between vaccination rate and CFR (-0.34). The results indicate a moderate positive correlation between vaccination rate and bi-weekly incidence rate and a weak negative correlation between vaccination rate and case fatality rate. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:  Our study is interesting for the observation that the bi-weekly incidence rate of COVID-19 positively correlated with the rate of vaccination. In contrast, the vaccination rate correlated negatively with the case fatality rate. Although several factors may have contributed to the increased incidence rates for COVID-19, these observations refute the myth that COVID-19 vaccination offers complete protection from reinfection, especially in the backdrop of easing pandemic containment measures by some countries. An increase in the vaccination rate is certainly a positive contributor to the decreasing case fatality observed."	"2168-8184

Indian Armed Forces launched its vaccine drive against COVID-19 on 16 Jan 2021. This study evaluated the effect of vaccination on mortality amongst hospitalized COVID patients. METHODS: A cross sectional study was done on all admitted moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at a designated COVID hospital in New Delhi. The primary outcome assessed the association of being fully vaccinated with mortality. Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) (with 95% CI) was performed for each predictor. Logistic regression was used for multivariable analysis and adjusted odds ratios obtained. RESULTS: The 1168 patients included in the study had a male preponderance with a mean age of 54.6 (± 17.51) years. A total of 266 (23%) patients were partially vaccinated with COVISHIELD® and 184 (16%) were fully vaccinated. Overall, 518 (44.3%) patients had comorbidities and 332 (28.4%) died. Among those fully vaccinated, there was 12.5% (23/184) mortality while it was 31.45 % (309/984) among the unvaccinated (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.5, p<0.0001). In a logistic regression model, complete vaccination status and younger age were found to be associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with two doses of COVISHIELD® was associated with lower odds of mortality among hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID."	"2213-4743

Associations between sex, age and chronic conditions, with ICU/HDU admission and in-hospital mortality were examined using Pearson's chi-squared test, and crude odds ratio (OR) estimates with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI).ResultsOf 25,971 hospitalised COVID-19 cases, 55% were male, 35% were 75 years or older and 90% had a chronic underlying condition. Patients with two or more chronic underlying conditions were significantly more likely to die in-hospital from COVID-19 (OR: 10.84; 95% CI: 8.30-14.16) than those without a chronic condition.ConclusionThe surveillance demonstrated that males, those 75 years or older and those with chronic conditions were at greater risk of in-hospital death. Over the surveillance period, outcomes tended to improve, likely because of vaccinations. This surveillance has laid the groundwork for further research studies investigating the risk factors of hospitalised COVID-19 cases and vaccine effectiveness."	"1560-7917

The changing epidemiological and therapeutic scenarios suggest that there has been an improvement in severity and survival of COVID-19 during the different waves of the pandemic in the general population, but this has not been investigated yet in MM patients. Here we analyzed a large cohort of 1221 patients with MM and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection observed between February 2020, and August 2022, in the EPICOVIDEHA registry from 132 centers around the world. Median follow-up was 52 days for the entire cohort and 83 days for survivors. Three-hundred and three patients died (24%) and COVID-19 was the primary reason for death of around 89% of them. Overall survival (OS) was significantly higher in vaccinated patients with both stable and active MM versus unvaccinated, while only a trend favoring vaccinated patients was observed in subjects with responsive MM. Vaccinated patients with at least 2 doses showed a better OS than those with one or no vaccine dose. Overall, according to pandemic waves, mortality rate decreased over time from 34% to 10%. In multivariable analysis, age, renal failure, active disease, hospital, and intensive care unit admission, were independently associated with a higher number of deaths, while a neutrophil count above 0.5 × 10(9) /L was found to be protective. This data suggests that MM patients remain at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection even in the vaccination era, but their clinical outcome, in terms of OS, has progressively improved throughout the different viral phases of the pandemic."

We studied the relationship of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) with COVID-19 severity and mortality among hospitalized patients in Pakistan. METHODS: A retrospective review of clinical, laboratory, and vaccination data of 197 COVID-19 adult patients at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi between April 2021, and February 2022 was performed. SARS-CoV-2 VOC identified in respiratory samples were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: The median age of cases was 55 years and 51.8% were males. Twenty-four percent of females were pregnant. Of COVID-19 cases, 48.2% had nonsevere disease, while 52.8% had severe/critical disease. Hypertension (48%) and diabetes mellitus (41%) were common comorbids. SARS-CoV-2 VOC identified comprised; Omicron (55.3%), Beta (14.7%), Alpha (13.7%), Delta (12.7%), and Gamma (3.6%) variants. Most (59.7%) study subjects were unvaccinated. Of vaccines, 88% had received inactivated virus COVID-19 vaccines. Increased risk of severe disease was associated with age ≥50 years (odds ratio [OR]: 5.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [2.45-13.7]), as well as with diabetes mellitus (OR: 4.24; 95% CI: [1.82-9.85]). Full vaccination (OR: 0.25; 95% CI: [0.11-0.58]) or infection with Omicron (OR: 0.42; 95% CI: [0.23-0.74]) was associated with reduced disease severity. The risk of mortality increased with age ≥50 years (OR: 5.07; 95% CI: [1.92-13.42]) and a history of myocardial infarction (OR: 5.11; 95% CI: [1.45-17.93]) whilst, infection with Omicron was found to reduce the risk (OR: 0.22; 95% CI: [0.10-0.53]). CONCLUSION: Our study describes the relationship between the severity of COVID-19, in-hospital mortality in relation to SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in Pakistan. Outcomes were more favorable in younger individuals, after vaccinations and with Omicron variant infections. Most cases received inactivated virus vaccines therefore these data highlight the protection provided against severe COVID-19."	"2398-8835

Patients may suffer from a constellation of symptoms termed post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) . Here we present findings of a retrospective cohort study describing the prevalence and predicting factors of patient-reported post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Categorical variables were summarized as frequency (percentage) and compared between vaccine status groups using Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables were reported as median (range) and compared between the groups using Kruskal-Wallis test. All tests were two-sided with p value <0.05 considered statistically significant. Survey data from 132 patients with a median age of 45 years, 68% female, 83% Caucasian/Non-Hispanic. The most frequently reported PASC symptoms include fatigue (84.8%), dyspnea (54.5%), cognitive dysfunction (53%), myalgias (37.1%), lightheadedness or vertigo (36.4%), chest pain (34.8%), palpitations (34.8%), headaches (34.1%), arthralgias (31.8%), and unrefreshing sleep (31.1%). There is mounting evidence that supports higher prevalence of PASC in women, White/Caucasian, and middle-aged individuals. This knowledge can provide guidance to clinical practices to anticipate and support healthcare and self-care needs for patients at higher risk to developing PASC."	"1708-8267

OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical outcomes of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who had been vaccinated with either Covishield or Covaxin. METHODS: This prospective, single-centre, observational cohort study of 1160 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was conducted between April and June 2021. Severity of disease at admission and during hospitalization, requirement for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and ventilatory support, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer), neutralizing antibody levels and mortality were assessed in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. RESULTS: More than 90% of patients in this study harboured the Delta variant (Pango lineage B.1.617.2) of SARS-CoV-2. Severity of disease at admission and during hospitalization (3.44% vs 7.51%; P=0.0032) and requirement for ICU admission and ventilatory support (2.83% vs 5.86%; P=0.0154) were significantly lower in vaccinated patients compared with unvaccinated patients. Vaccinated patients also had significantly (P<0.0001) higher antibody levels and lower inflammatory marker levels compared with unvaccinated patients. A subset of vaccinated, deceased patients mounted minimal antibody response ['non-responders': 4.53 (standard deviation 1.40) AU/mL]. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Covishield and Covaxin against severe disease in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 with breakthrough infections caused by the Delta variant. Strategies targeting non-responders are desirable to minimize morbidity and mortality."	"2772-7076

METHODS: NCRC is an on-going data collection platform operational in 42 hospitals across India. Data of hospitalized COVID-19 patients enrolled in NCRC between 1st September 2020 to 26th October 2021 were examined. RESULTS: Analysis of 29 509 hospitalized, adult COVID-19 patients [mean (SD) age: 51.1 (16.2) year; male: 18 752 (63.6%)] showed that 15 678 (53.1%) had at least one comorbidity. Among 25 715 (87.1%) symptomatic patients, fever was the commonest symptom (72.3%) followed by shortness of breath (48.9%) and dry cough (45.5%). In-hospital mortality was 14.5% (n = 3957). Adjusted odds of dying were significantly higher in age group ≥60 years, males, with diabetes, chronic kidney diseases, chronic liver disease, malignancy and tuberculosis, presenting with dyspnoea and neurological symptoms. WHO ordinal scale 4 or above at admission carried the highest odds of dying [5.6 (95% CI: 4.6-7.0)]. Patients receiving one [OR: 0.5 (95% CI: 0.4-0.7)] or two doses of anti-SARS CoV-2 vaccine [OR: 0.4 (95% CI: 0.3-0.7)] were protected from in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: WHO ordinal scale at admission is the most important independent predictor for in-hospital death in COVID-19 patients. Anti-SARS-CoV2 vaccination provides significant protection against mortality."	"1460-2393

The aim of this study was to explore inequalities in the incidence and mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine uptake in various sociodemographic and population group strata in Israel. METHODS: We analysed nationwide publicly available, aggregated data on PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths between March 2020 and February 2021, as well as the first three months of COVID-19 immunisation according to sociodemographics, including population group and residential socioeconomic status (SES). We computed incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19. Comparisons between towns with predominantly Arab, ultra-Orthodox Jewish (the minorities), general Jewish populations, and according to SES, were conducted using generalised linear models with negative binomial distribution. FINDINGS: Overall, 774,030 individuals had SARS-CoV-2 infection (cumulative incidence 84•5 per 1,000 persons) and 5687 COVID-19 patients had died (mortality rate 62•8 per 100,000 persons). The highest mortality rate was found amongst the elderly. Most (>75%) individuals aged 60 years or above have been vaccinated with BNT162b2 vaccine. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher in towns with predominantly Arab and ultra-Orthodox Jewish populations than in the general Jewish population, and in low SES communities. COVID-19 mortality rate was highest amongst Arabs. Conversely, vaccine uptake was lower amongst Arab and ultra-Orthodox Jewish populations and low SES communities. INTERPRETATION: Ethnic and religious minorities and low SES communities experience substantial COVID-19 burden, and have lower vaccine uptake, even in a society with universal accessibility to healthcare. Quantifying these inequalities is fundamental towards reducing these gaps, which imposes a designated apportion of resources to adequately control the pandemic. FUNDING: No external funding was available for this study."	"2666-7762

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of BNT162b2 third dose (first booster dose) with overall SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalizations, and mortality among LTCF residents during a nationwide surge of the Delta variant in Israel. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational cohort study conducted nationwide COVID-19 surveillance in LTCFs in Israel between August and October 2021. Participants were residents of LTCFs aged 60 years or older. EXPOSURES: Vaccination with the third dose of BNT162b2 vaccine vs receipt of 2 doses at least 5 months earlier, based on self-preference and choice. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The cumulative incidences of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalizations, and COVID-19-related deaths more than 7 days after vaccination with the third dose were compared between the groups using Kaplan-Meier curves. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were obtained using multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: Among 18 611 residents included in the analysis, 12 715 (68.3%) were female, 463 (2.5%) were from the Arab population, 16 976 (91.2%) were from the general Jewish population, and 618 (3.3%) were from the ultraorthodox Jewish population; the mean (SD) age was 81.1 (9.2) years; 16 082 residents received their first booster dose (third dose) and 2529 were vaccinated with 2 doses at least 5 months earlier. The median (IQR) follow-up durations were 66 (60-70) days among 3-dose recipients and 56 (53-62) days among 2-dose-only recipients; 107 residents had SARS-CoV-2 infection after 7 days following vaccination with the booster dose compared with 185 among the 2-dose only group (cumulative incidence: 0.7% vs 7.5%; adjusted HR, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.07-0.15]). The respective adjusted HRs were 0.07 (95% CI, 0.03-0.14) and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.04-0.24) for the associations of vaccination with the third dose with hospitalization for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and severe illness. Five COVID-19-related deaths occurred among the third dose vaccinees during the follow-up period compared with 22 among the 2-dose-only vaccinees (cumulative rate: 0.04% vs 0.9%; adjusted HR, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.009-0.16]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found significant inverse associations between vaccination with the third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine with overall SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalizations, severe disease, and COVID-19-related deaths among LTCF residents during a massive surge caused by the Delta variant in Israel."

METHODOLOGY: Descriptive case series study using Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz/AstraZeneca Brazil and National Immunization Program/Ministry of Health (NIP/MoH) data on COVID-19 AEFI surveillance. We obtained patient-level data from pharmacovigilance for AEFI surveillance and used both the NIP/MoH and Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz pharmacovigilance databases to create the study database. Thirty-nine cases of suspect VITT were included, 36 after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one after BNT162b2 and two after Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. All cases were based on meeting the Brighton Collaboration criteria for VITT. The primary outcomes were clinical and laboratory features, site of thrombosis, and anti-PF4 ELISA, when available. RESULTS: Thirty-nine cases met the criteria, 38 of which were classified as level 1 and one as level 3 according to Brighton Collaboration. Most cases had the central nervous system (CNS) as the main site of thrombosis (21/39) and happened after the vaccine first dose (34/39). The median age of the cases was 41 years old (23 to 86 yo). Most of the cases (61.5%) occurred in women. The median interval between vaccination and onset of symptoms was 8 days (0-37 days). The platelet count and D-dimer count had median values of 34,000/µL and 19,235 µg FEU/L, respectively. The ELISA anti-PF4 antibody was positive in 18 samples. The overall mortality rate was 51% and was higher in cases of CNS thrombosis with intracerebral bleeding. CONCLUSION: Our case series shows that Brazilian VITT cases have similar clinical and laboratory profiles as demonstrated in the literature. Brazil has administered more than 300 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines (more than 110 million from ChAdOx1 nCoV-19). VITT seems to be a very rare but serious adverse event following COVID-19 immunization, especially adenoviral vector immunization."	"1873-2518

Limited data are available on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines administered during and around the time of pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and summarize reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a national spontaneous reporting system, in pregnant persons who received a COVID-19 vaccine to assess for potential vaccine safety problems. METHODS: We searched VAERS for US reports of adverse events (AEs) in pregnant persons who received a COVID-19 vaccine from 12/14/2020-10/31/2021. Clinicians reviewed reports and available medical records. Crude reporting rates for selected AEs were calculated, and disproportional reporting was assessed using data mining methods. RESULTS: VAERS received 3,462 reports of AEs in pregnant persons who received a COVID-19 vaccine; 1,831 (52.9%) after BNT162b2, 1,350 (38.9%) after mRNA-1273, and 275 (7.9%) after Ad26.COV2.S. Eight maternal deaths and 12 neonatal deaths were reported. Six-hundred twenty-one (17.9%) reports were serious. Pregnancy-specific outcomes included: 878 spontaneous abortions (<20 weeks), 101 episodes of vaginal bleeding, 76 preterm deliveries (<37 weeks), 62 stillbirths (≥20 weeks), and 33 outcomes with birth defects. Crude reporting rates for preterm deliveries and stillbirths, as well as maternal and neonatal mortality rates were below background rates from published sources. No disproportional reporting for any AE was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Review of reports to VAERS following COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant persons did not identify any concerning patterns of maternal or infant-fetal outcomes."	"1873-2518

Our study aims to analyze how vaccination modifies the likelihood of death and length of stay in hospitalized patients with COVID-19; (2) Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 1927 hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19 was conducted. Information was gathered on vaccination status, hospitalization episode, and clinical profile of the patients. The effect of vaccination on mortality was analyzed using a multiple logistic regression model, and length of stay was analyzed using linear regression. The performance and fit of the models were evaluated; (3) Results: In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the risk of dying during admission in vaccinated patients was half that of non-vaccinated (OR: 0.45; CI 95%: 0.25 to 0.84). In patients who were discharged due to improvement, the reduction in hospital stay in vaccinated patients was 3.17 days (CI 95%: 5.88 to 0.47); (4) Conclusions: Patients who, despite having been vaccinated, acquire the infection by SARS-CoV-2, have a significant reduction of the risk of death during admission and a reduction of hospital stay compared with unvaccinated patients."

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to assess the safety of vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in frail nursing home residents and to evaluate its effectiveness 6 months after full vaccination. DESIGN: This was an ambispective observational study. SETTING: Residents of a long-term care facility in Madrid, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and thirty-seven nursing home residents (81.8% female, mean age 87.77 ± 8.31 years) with high comorbidity (61.3% Charlson Index ≥ 3) and frailty (75% Clinical Frail Scale ≥ 7) who received the BNT162B2 mRNA vaccine. MEASUREMENTS: Safety data were collected to evaluate the type of adverse drug reactions and their duration, severity, and causality. Immunogenicity was tested 6 months after the primary vaccination and effectiveness was evaluated by the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the number of hospital admissions, and mortality due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: Safety: Of the residents, 21.9% had some adverse reaction and 5.8% had a severe or more serious adverse reaction. The most frequent adverse reactions were fatigue (13.1%), pyrexia (12.4%), and headache (7.3%). No association was observed between frailty (including a need for palliative care) and clinical, functional or cognitive status of the participants and the occurrence of adverse events. Immunogenicity and Effectiveness: After 6 months of vaccination, only one case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in the vaccinated residents. Most of the nursing home residents presented positive serology (95.2%). Loss of immunogenicity was associated with older age (95.12 ± 3.97 vs. 87.24 ± 8.25 years; p = 0.03) and no previous COVID-19 infection (16.6% vs. 70%; p < 0.001). Binary logistic regression models did not reveal this association. CONCLUSION: The BNT162B2 vaccine is well tolerated and effective in nursing home residents, independently of their clinical, functional, cognitive, or frailty characteristics. For the most part, immunogenicity has been maintained over time, regardless of comorbidity, functional status or frailty."	"1179-1969

We sought to determine the real-world effectiveness of bebtelovimab during the Omicron phases BA.2/BA2.12.1/BA4/BA5. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection between April 6 and October 11, 2022, using health records linked to vaccine and mortality data. We used propensity scores to match of bebtelovimab-treated with untreated outpatients. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause hospitalization. The secondary outcomes were 28-day COVID-19-related hospitalization, 28-day all-cause mortality, 28-day emergency department visits, maximum respiratory support level, intensive care unit admission, and in-hospital mortality among hospitalized patients. We used logistic regression to determine bebtelovimab treatment effectiveness. RESULTS: Among 22,720 patients with SARS-COV-2 infection, 3739 bebtelovimab-treated patients were matched to 5423 untreated patients. Compared with no treatment, bebtelovimab was associated with lower odds of 28-day all-cause hospitalization (1.3% vs 2.1%, adjusted odds ratio: 0.53; 95% confidence interval: 0.37-0.74, P <0.001), as well as COVID-19-related hospitalization (1.0% vs 2.0%, adjusted odds ratio: 0.44 [95% confidence interval: 0.30-0.64], P <0.001). Bebtelovimab appeared to be more beneficial in lowering the odds of hospitalization among patients with two or more comorbidities (interaction P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: During the Omicron BA.2/BA.2.12.1/BA.4/BA.5 variant phase, bebtelovimab was associated with lower hospitalization."	"1878-3511

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between 15 January 2022 and 15 February 2022 across 9 hospitals in a large health network. Data were extracted by manual records review. RESULTS: A total of 351 of 452 (77.7%) unvaccinated, 209 of 331 (63.1%) fully vaccinated, and 107 of 163 (65.6%) boosted patients hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis were determined to be admitted specifically due to COVID-19 (P < .001). Most (85%) boosted patients admitted due to COVID-19 were at least 65 years old and/or had severe immunosuppression, compared to 72.2% of fully vaccinated and 60.7% of unvaccinated patients (P < .001). Significantly more unvaccinated patients (34.2%) required >6 L/minute of supplemental oxygen compared to fully vaccinated (24.4%) and boosted (25.2%) patients (P = .027). The age-adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization due to COVID-19 was estimated to be 81.1% and 94.1% for full vaccination and boosted status, respectively, whereas VE against mortality related to COVID-19 was estimated to be 84.7% and 94.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: During the Omicron BA.1 sublineage wave, unvaccinated patients hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis were more likely than vaccinated patients to be admitted specifically due to COVID-19. Despite being younger with fewer comorbidities, unvaccinated patients required higher levels of care. Vaccination with a booster provides the greatest protection against hospitalization and death from COVID-19."	"2328-8957

Fortunately, anti-COVID-19 vaccination campaigns have helped to protect frontline workers and reduce COVID-19-related mortality amongst this occupational group. We analyzed COVID-19-related mortality data for doctors in Italy and compared the crude mortality rate between March-May 2020 (i.e., the beginning of the pandemic in Italy, with the highest rates of COVID-19-related deaths) and the same time period in March-May 2021 (high vaccination coverage amongst Italian physicians). The mortality rate was 12 times higher in March-May 2020 compared to the same time period after the start of the Italian vaccination campaign. Moreover, there was a strong inverse correlation between the number of deaths and the cumulative number of vaccine doses administered in the Italian population. Although non-pharmaceutical interventions, virus evolution and environmental factors probably had an effect, our analysis clearly supports the hypothesis that the vaccination campaign helped to protect Italian physicians and reduce COVID-19-related mortality. The latest available death trends from September to October 2021 for both physicians and the general population are also in favor of the need for the third vaccine dose, currently underway for the majority of the population at risk."

Furthermore, clinical trials have shown that drugs such as antiviral drugs, antibody cocktails, steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs can be expected to prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes and death. METHODS: This study, using inpatient records from the Medical Information Analysis Databank covering national hospital organizations in Japan, was conducted to evaluate the effects of underlying diseases and/or administered drugs on mortality. Subjects were all inpatients receiving oxygen administration and inpatients using respiratory ventilators, categorized by three age classes: all ages, patients 65 years old or older, and patients younger than 65 years old. We used logistic regression to analyze outcomes for underlying diseases, administered drugs, age, sex, the proportion of the mutated strains, and vaccine coverage. RESULTS: Patients with hypertension, except for younger inpatients, have a lower risk of mortality (estimated coefficient 0.67 among all inpatients (p < 0.01): 0.77 among inpatients with oxygen therapy (p = 0.02) and 0.57 among inpatients with respiratory ventilation w (p = 0.01)). Except for younger inpatients, antibody cocktail (casirivimab/imdevimab or sotrovimab) administration was associated with a higher probability of survival (estimated coefficient 0.27 among all inpatients (p < 0.01)). It raised the survival probability consistently, although other drugs might have reduced the probability of survival. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that antiviral drugs (remdesivir, estimated coefficient 1.44 (p < 0.01)), steroids (dexamethasone, estimated coefficient 1.85 (p < 0.01)), and anti-inflammatory drugs (baricitinib, estimated coefficient 1.62 (p < 0.01), and tocilizumab, estimated coefficient 2.73 (p < 0.01)) might not contribute to survival. These results have not been reported from earlier studies. More sophisticated estimation procedures, such as treatment effect models, are necessary to obtain conclusive results."	"1178-7074

Data derived from administrative repositories during mass vaccination campaigns or programs are of interest to study vaccine effectiveness. METHODS: Using 4-repository administrative data linkage, we conducted a historical cohort study on a target population of 1 882 148 inhabitants aged at least 18 years residing in southern Iran. RESULTS: We estimated a 71.9% [95% confidence interval [CI], 70.7%-73.1%], 81.5% [95% CI, 79.5%-83.4%], 67.5% [95% CI, 59.5%-75.6%], and 86.4% [95% CI, 84.1%-88.8%] hospital admission reduction for those who received the full vaccination schedule of BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm), ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222, Oxford-AstraZeneca), rAd26-rAd5 (Gam-COVID-Vac, Sputnik V), and BIV1-CovIran (COVIran Barekat) vaccines, respectively. A high reduction in mortality (at least 85%) was observed in all age subgroups of the fully immunized population. CONCLUSIONS: The pragmatic implementation of a vaccination plan including all available vaccine options in the Iranian population was associated with a significant reduction in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) detected infections as well as hospital admissions and deaths associated with COVID-19."

A retrospective study of HM patients treated for mild/moderate COVID-19 between March 2021 and July 2022 was performed. The main composite end-point was treatment failure (severe COVID-19 or COVID-19-related death). We included 328 consecutive patients who received MABs (n = 120, 37%; sotrovimab, n = 73) or antivirals (n = 208, 63%; nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, n = 116) over a median of two days after symptoms started; 111 (33.8%) had non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL); 89 (27%) were transplant/CAR-T (chimaeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy) recipients. Most infections (n = 309, 94%) occurred during the Omicron period. Failure developed in 31 patients (9.5%). Its independent predictors were older age, fewer vaccine doses, and treatment with MABs. Rate of failure was lower in the Omicron versus the pre-Omicron period (7.8% versus 36.8%, p < 0.001). During the Omicron period, predictors of failure were age, fewer vaccine doses and diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS). Independent predictors of longer viral shedding were age, comorbidities, hospital admission at diagnosis, NHL/CLL, treatment with MABs. COVID-19-associated mortality was 3.4% (n = 11). The mortality in those who developed severe COVID-19 after early treatment was 26% in the Omicron period. Patients with HM had a significant risk of failure of early treatment, even during the Omicron period, with high mortality rate."	"1365-2141

Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to prevent severe COVID-19 disease in end-stage kidney disease patients remains limited. We compared the incidence of COVID-19-related hospitalization and death in dialysis patients based on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine status. METHODS: Retrospective study of adults on chronic dialysis within Mayo Clinic Dialysis System in the Midwest (USA) between April 1st, 2020 and October 31st, 2022, who had a laboratory test positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Incidence of both COVID-19-related hospitalization and death were compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was identified in 309 patients, including 183 vaccinated and 126 unvaccinated. The incidence of death (11.1% vs 3.8%, p = 0.02) and hospitalization (55.6% vs 23.5%, p < 0.001) was significantly higher in unvaccinated compared to vaccinated patients. Age at infection, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, dialysis modality, and hospital stays did not differ between the two groups. The incidence of hospitalization was significantly higher in partially vaccinated (63.6% vs 20.9%, p = 0.004) and unboosted (32% vs 16.4%, p = 0.04) patients compared to fully vaccinated and boosted, respectively. Among the 21 patients who died in the whole cohort, 47.6% (n = 10) died during the pre-vaccine period. The composite risk of death or hospitalization was lower among vaccinated patients after adjusting for age, sex and Charlson comorbidity index (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15-0.40). CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to improve COVID-19 outcomes in patients on chronic dialysis."	"1724-6059

Severity"	"BACKGROUND: Vaccines against COVID-19 show high efficacy, yet, infection is still being detected among immunized patients, although with blunted severity. The purpose of this study was to assess the severity of COVID-19 infection among immunized versus non-immunized COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU. METHOD: A prospective observational cohort study, including all COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit between January 1st, 2021 and June 30th, 2021 were eligible for inclusion. A comparison of severity upon hospitalization of immunized versus non-immunized patients on a 7-level ordinal scale was conducted, using ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: 592 patients were enrolled, 524 (88.5%) non-immunized, 63 (10.6%) partially immunized, and 5 (0.9%) fully immunized, partially and fully immunized patients were grouped together. Majority of immunized patients (86.7%) were symptomatic before 21 days of immunization. Non-immunized group had fewer patients in the lower severity categories, while more patients in the higher severity categories compared to immunized group. At least one dose of immunization was associated with reduction of odds of moving up severity scale (OR = 0.2 [95% CI: 0.15-0.4]; p < 0.001) in a well fitted ordinal logistic regression model. At least one dose of immunization was associated with lower adjusted odds of 30 day all-cause mortality (OR = 0.45 [95% CI: 0.23-0.89]; p = 0.02). Non-immunized group had higher mortality rate (43.9% versus 29.4% [95% CI: 1.5 to 25.8]; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Most COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU were non-immunized, most of the partially immunized patients got infected before immunity could develop, and fully immunized patients were likely non-responders. At least one dose of immunization significantly decreases severity of the disease across all ordinal severity categories, and is significantly associated with lower 30 day all-cause mortality. Accordingly, immunization status may have to be considered when deciding on disposition of COVID-19 patients at the point of triage."	"2049-0801

A large number of vaccines have been developed. However, confidence in any COVID-19 vaccine is essential for its sustainable success. The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 CoV-19) vaccine against SARS-COV-2 cases, hospital admissions, type of variants and deaths. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study recorded data using electronic platforms PubMed, Web of Science, World Health Organization, US-Food and Drug Authorities-FDA, Facts sheets, and Pharmaceutical Websites. Initially, 278 articles and reports were identified, and after revising the abstracts, 39 studies, clinical trials and organizations, reports were selected for a detailed analysis. RESULTS: The efficacy of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine against symptomatic COVID-19 cases after the first dose was 60.59% (p=0.00001) and after the second dose was 66.84% (p=0.00001). The highest efficacy was against the Alpha variant 58.80% (p=0.00001) and the lowest efficacy was against the Beta variant 30.83% (p=0.00001). However, the overall efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 variants after the first dose was 49.20%. The highest efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 variants after the second dose against the Beta (B.1.351) variant was 90.34% (p=0.00001), while the lowest efficacy was against the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant 46.46% (p=0.00001), with overall efficacy against SARS-CoV-2-2 variants after the second dose 73.73%. The highest efficacy against emergency admission was 94.42% (p=0.00001), while the lowest efficacy was 86.57% (p=0.00001), with overall efficacy against ICU, hospital, and emergency admissions after the second dose was 87.74%. Furthermore, the efficacy of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against deaths after the second dose was 87.44% (p=0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine against symptomatic COVID-19 cases, various variants, ICU, and emergency admissions, and against deaths was high. The present study results provide valuable insights for healthcare workers, policymakers, and researchers about the precise efficacy levels against symptomatic cases, hospitalization, and mortality across the diverse populations and age groups."

METHODS: In this cohort study, 118 dialysis centres from 18 Italian Regions participated. Individuals older than 16 years on dialysis treatment for at least 3 months, who provided informed consent were included. We collected demographic and clinical information, as well as data on vaccination status, hospitalisations, access to intensive care units and adverse events. We calculated the incidence, hospitalisation, mortality, and fatality rates in the vaccinated dialysis cohort, adjusted for several covariates. The incidence rates of infection in the dialysis cohort and the general population were compared through Standardised Incidence Rate Ratio. RESULTS: The study included 6555 patients vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 infection according to the schedule recommended in Italy. Between March 2021 and May 2022, there were 1096 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an incidence rate after completion of the three-dose vaccination cycle of 37.7 cases per 100 person-years. Compared to the general population, we observed a 14% reduction in the risk of infection for patients who received three vaccine doses (Standardised Incidence Rate Ratio: 0.86; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.81-0.91), whereas no statistically significant differences were found for COVID-19-related hospitalisations, intensive care unit admissions or death. No safety signals emerged from the reported adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The vaccination program against SARS-CoV-2 in the haemodialysis population showed an effectiveness and safety profile comparable to that seen in the general population."	"1724-6059

vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)"	"BACKGROUND: The emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the administration of different booster vaccines to mitigate COVID-19. Vaccines with adenoviral vectors have been rarely associated with vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe 15 cases of VITT after the third and fourth doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in Brazil. METHODS: Cases were reported after all kinds of anti-SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccinations between October 17, 2021, and September 4, 2022. RESULTS: Of the 26 suspected cases, 15 cases of VITT were analyzed. Of these, 10 were classified as definite VITT, 2 as probable, 1 as possible, and 2 as unlikely. The estimated frequency of definite, probable, or possible VITT was 0.33 cases per million. Cases were assigned to ChAdOx1 (13 cases), Ad26.COV2.S (1 case), and BNT162b2 (1 case). None of the patients received an adenoviral vaccine as a primary vaccination. The average age of participants was 34 years, and symptoms usually appeared 8 days after vaccination. Headache was the most common symptom, and cerebral veins were the most affected thrombotic site. The overall mortality risk was 53%. Anti-platelet factor 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serology was positive in 11 out of 15 patients (73.3%), negative in 2 (13.3%), and missing in 2 (13.3%). CONCLUSION: The study confirms that VITT is linked to the first exposure to adenoviral vector vaccines. Since January 2023, Brazil has recommended preferably COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccines for individuals aged 18 to 39 years. We suggest that, in the current disease scenario, COVID-19 adenovirus vaccines should not be the first choice for individuals aged <50 years who have not received a previous dose of this type of vaccine."

Excess deaths may be attributed directly to SARS-CoV-2 infection or indirectly to deaths associated with social and economic upheavals resulting from the pandemic. Data on all deaths registered in government-controlled Ukraine from 2016-2021 (N = 3,657,475) were utilized. Using a model-based approach, we predicted monthly excess deaths in 2020 and 2021. We estimated 47,578 excess deaths in 2020 as a whole (7.71% of all recorded deaths). This figure reflects both positive (higher than expected) excess deaths from June-December and negative (lower than expected) deaths in January and March-May. From June-December 2020, we estimated 59,363 excess deaths (15.75% of all recorded deaths in those months). In 2021, we estimated 150,049 excess deaths (21.01% of all recorded deaths). Positive excess deaths were detected across age groups even groups younger than 40 years. The number of excess deaths exceeded that of deaths with COVID-19 coded on the death certificate by more than two-fold in 2020, but that difference narrowed in 2021. We furthermore provide provisional estimates of the effect of low vaccine coverage on excess deaths in 2021 drawing from European cross-national evidence and provisional estimates of the hypothetical evolution of the pandemic in 2022 to serve as a rough basis for future studies analyzing the joint impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion on Ukrainian demography."

METHODS: This retrospective study assessed the medical records of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, who were admitted to a tertiary hospital from July 10 to September 15, 2021. Adjusted binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine factors associated with poor outcomes. RESULTS: More than 25% of hospitalized patients received at least one vaccine dose of SARS-CoV-2. The Sinopharm BIBP vaccine (China) was the most commonly received vaccine (73.3%). After adjusting for age and comorbidities, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for poor outcomes was significantly lower in hospitalized patients who received Remdesivir compared to those not receiving Remdesivir (AOR: 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15, 0.78; p < .010). Besides, age ≥50 years (AOR: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.38, 4.59; p < .003), low educational level (AOR: 3.99; 95% CI: 1.17, 13.53; p < .027), work outside in the past year (AOR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.02, 3.00; p < .041), and diabetes mellitus (AOR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.66, 3.26; p = .011) were associated with more poor outcomes. CONCLUSION: Based on the present results, the risk of mortality and the risk of poor outcomes were lower in patients who received Remdesivir compared to those not receiving Remdesivir. The number of vaccinated patients was smaller than the unvaccinated among hospitalized patients. It is important to emphasize that vaccination reduced the need for hospitalization and that only vaccinated patients with comorbidities required hospitalization."	"2050-4527

Nevertheless, relatively few reports have been published focusing specifically on New Jersey. Here we report on molecular, clinical, and epidemiologic observations, from the largest healthcare network in the state, in a cohort of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We conducted molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal swabs collected in nine hospitals from December 2020 through June 2022, using both whole genome sequencing (WGS) and a real-time RT-PCR screening assay targeting spike protein mutations found in variants of concern (VOCs) within our region. De-identified clinical data were obtained retrospectively, including demographics, COVID-19 vaccination status, ICU admission, ventilator support, mortality, and medical history. Statistical analyses were performed to identify associations between SARS-CoV-2 variants, vaccination status, clinical outcomes, and medical risk factors. A total of 5007 SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal swabs were successfully screened and/or sequenced. Variant screening identified three predominant VOCs, including Alpha (n = 714), Delta (n = 1877), and Omicron (n = 1802). Omicron isolates were further sub-typed as BA.1 (n = 899), BA.2 (n = 853), or BA.4/BA.5 (n = 50); the remaining 614 isolates were classified as "Other". Approximately 31.5% (1577/5007) of the samples were associated with vaccine breakthrough infections, which increased in frequency following the emergence of Delta and Omicron. Severe clinical outcomes included ICU admission (336/5007 = 6.7%), ventilator support (236/5007 = 4.7%), and mortality (430/5007 = 8.6%), with increasing age being the most significant contributor to each (p < 0.001). Unvaccinated individuals accounted for 79.7% (268/336) of ICU admissions, 78.3% (185/236) of ventilator cases, and 74.4% (320/430) of deaths. Highly significant (p < 0.001) increases in mortality were observed in individuals with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, but not with obesity, thyroid disease, or respiratory disease. Significant differences (p < 0.001) in clinical outcomes were also noted between SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2. Vaccination was associated with significantly improved clinical outcomes in our study, despite an increase in breakthrough infections associated with waning immunity, greater antigenic variability, or both. Underlying comorbidities contributed significantly to mortality in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, with increasing risk based on the total number of comorbidities. Real-time RT-PCR-based screening facilitated timely identification of predominant variants using a minimal number of spike protein mutations, with faster turnaround time and reduced cost compared to WGS. Continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants will likely require ongoing surveillance for new VOCs, with real-time assessment of clinical impact."	"1999-4915

On March 29, 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster dose for adults aged ≥50 years and all immunocompromised persons who had received a first booster ≥4 months earlier.* On September 1, 2022, ACIP voted to recommend bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine boosters for all persons aged ≥12 years who had completed the primary series using monovalent vaccines ≥2 months earlier (2). Data on COVID-19 booster dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the nursing home population are limited (3). For this analysis, academic, federal, and private partners evaluated routine care data collected from 196 U.S. community nursing homes to estimate VE of a second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster dose among nursing home residents who had received 3 previous COVID-19 vaccine doses (2 primary series doses and 1 booster dose). Residents who received second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster doses during March 29-June 15, 2022, with follow-up through July 25, 2022, were found to have 60-day VE of 25.8% against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19 infection), 73.9% against severe COVID-19 outcomes (a combined endpoint of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations or deaths), and 89.6% against COVID-19-associated deaths alone. During this period, subvariants BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 (March-June 2022), and BA.4 and BA.5 (July 2022) of the B.1.1.529 and BA.2 (Omicron) variant were predominant. These findings suggest that among nursing home residents, second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster doses provided additional protection over first booster doses against severe COVID-19 outcomes during a time of emerging Omicron variants. Facilities should continue to ensure that nursing home residents remain up to date with COVID-19 vaccination, including bivalent vaccine booster doses, to prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes."

However, data on the effectiveness of an mRNA vaccine booster in preventing infection, hospitalization, and death in this vulnerable population are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine booster and prevention of infection, hospitalization, or death among nursing home residents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study emulated sequentially nested target trials for vaccination using data from 2 large multistate US nursing home systems: Genesis HealthCare, a community nursing home operator (system 1) and Veterans Health Administration community living centers (VHA CLCs; system 2). The cohort included long-term (≥100 days) nursing home residents (10 949 residents from 202 community nursing homes and 4321 residents from 128 VHA CLCs) who completed a 2-dose series of an mRNA vaccine (either BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) and were eligible for a booster dose between September 22 and November 30, 2021. Residents were followed up until March 8, 2022. EXPOSURES: Receipt of a third mRNA vaccine dose, defined as a booster dose (boosted group), or nonreceipt of a booster dose (unboosted group) on an eligible target trial date. If participants in the unboosted group received a booster dose on a later target trial date, they were included in the booster group for that target trial; thus, participants could be included in both the boosted and unboosted groups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Test-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, or death was followed up to 12 weeks after booster vaccination. The primary measure of estimated vaccine effectiveness was the ratio of cumulative incidences in the boosted group vs the unboosted group at week 12, adjusted with inverse probability weights for treatment and censoring. RESULTS: System 1 included 202 community nursing homes; among 8332 boosted residents (5325 [63.9%] female; 6685 [80.2%] White) vs 10 886 unboosted residents (6865 [63.1%] female; 8651 [79.5%] White), the median age was 78 (IQR, 68-87) years vs 78 (IQR, 68-86) years. System 2 included 128 VHA CLCs; among 3289 boosted residents (3157 [96.0%] male; 1950 [59.3%] White) vs 4317 unboosted residents (4151 [96.2%] male; 2434 [56.4%] White), the median age was 74 (IQR, 70-80) vs 74 (IQR, 69-80) years. Booster vaccination was associated with reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infections of 37.7% (95% CI, 25.4%-44.2%) in system 1 and 57.7% (95% CI, 43.5%-67.8%) in system 2. For hospitalization, reductions of 74.4% (95% CI, 44.6%-86.2%) in system 1 and 64.1% (95% CI, 41.3%-76.0%) in system 2 were observed. Estimated vaccine effectiveness for death associated with SARS-CoV-2 was 87.9% (95% CI, 75.9%-93.9%) in system 1; however, although a reduction in death was observed in system 2 (46.6%; 95% CI, -34.6% to 94.8%), this reduction was not statistically significant. A total of 45 SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths occurred in system 1 and 18 deaths occurred in system 2. For the combined end point of SARS-CoV-2-associated hospitalization or death, boosted residents in system 1 had an 80.3% (95% CI, 65.7%-88.5%) reduction, and boosted residents in system 2 had a 63.8% (95% CI, 41.4%-76.1%) reduction. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, during a period in which both the Delta and Omicron variants were circulating, SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination was associated with significant reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, and the combined end point of hospitalization or death among residents of 2 US nursing home systems. These findings suggest that administration of vaccine boosters to nursing home residents may have an important role in preventing COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality."	"2574-3805

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of different COVID-19 vaccination strategies in epidemiologically semi-enclosed settings such as prisons, where staff interact regularly with those incarcerated and the wider community. METHODS: We used a metapopulation transmission-dynamic model of a local prison in England and Wales. Two-dose vaccination strategies included no vaccination, vaccination of all individuals who are incarcerated and/or staff, and an age-based approach. Outcomes were quantified in terms of COVID-19-related symptomatic cases, losses in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and deaths. RESULTS: Compared to no vaccination, vaccinating all people living and working in prison reduced cases, QALY loss and deaths over a one-year period by 41%, 32% and 36% respectively. However, if vaccine introduction was delayed until the start of an outbreak, the impact was negligible. Vaccinating individuals who are incarcerated and staff over 50 years old averted one death for every 104 vaccination courses administered. All-staff-only strategies reduced cases by up to 5%. Increasing coverage from 30 to 90% among those who are incarcerated reduced cases by around 30 percentage points. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of vaccination in prison settings was highly dependent on early and rapid vaccine delivery. If administered to both those living and working in prison prior to an outbreak occurring, vaccines could substantially reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality in prison settings."	"1471-2458

RESULTS: Clinical picture was similar and survival analysis showed no differences between groups: 21.7% of fully vaccinated patients and 20.8% of unvaccinated or partially vaccinated died (P = 0.776). In multivariable analysis, age and pneumonia were independent risk factors for death, whereas vaccination status was not related to mortality. These results remained similar when we excluded patients with partial vaccination, as well as when we analyzed exclusively hospitalized patients. Patients vaccinated with mRNA-1273 (n = 213) showed a significantly lower mortality than those who received the BNT162b2 vaccine (n = 121) (hazard ratio: 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.85; P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 severity in KT patients has remained high and has not improved despite receiving 2 doses of the mRNA vaccine. The mRNA-1273 vaccine shows higher clinical effectiveness than BNT162b2 in KT recipients with breakthrough infections. Confirmation of these data will require further research taking into account the new variants and the administration of successive vaccine doses."	"1534-6080

This study aimed to describe the outcomes of a COVID-19 outbreak in a long-term care facility for elderly persons following the initial vaccination. A single-center, retrospective, observational design was used to analyze the variables associated with hospitalization and death rate by logistic regression. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Sixty-eight residents received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Despite being negative six days after vaccination, the performance of a second test 4 days later revealed 51 positives (75.0%) among residents and 18 among workers (56.3%). A total of 65 of the 68 residents (95.58%) had positive results with symptoms, whereas 34.9% required hospitalization, and 25.8% died. The best-fitting model to explain the distribution of cases reflects three points at the time of infection.. The time from vaccination to symptom onset explains the hospitalization and mortality rates since a day elapsed halves the risk of hospitalization (aOR = 0.57; CI = 0.38-0.75) and the risk of death by a quarter (aOR = 0.74; CI = 0.63-0.88). Nursing homes present an elevated risk of transmission and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although vaccination reduces the risk of hospitalization and death, extreme prevention and control measures are essential in these institutions despite the high vaccination coverage."	"2076-393x

METHODS: Data were obtained from the COVID-19 national integrated surveillance program, made available and regularly updated by the Italian National Institute of Health. RESULTS: Compared to those who completed the COVID-19 vaccination cycle for ≥ 5 months (n = 2,385,897), those receiving booster doses (n = 1,549,747) had 75% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 82-83% lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and ICU admission, and 81% lower risk of death. Administration of COVID-19 vaccine boosters generated also greater protection (between 63 and 87% higher) against all these same endpoints compared to early completing (i.e., < 5 months; n = 335,458) a primary COVID-19 vaccination cycle. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses is advisable for reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in older people."	"1878-7657

This study reports clinical impacts of a COVID-19 outbreak in a nursing home for elderly individuals in Kyoto City, Japan. METHODS: We performed epidemiologic and molecular investigations of the outbreak and characterized outcomes of the nursing home residents. RESULTS: During the outbreak period, a total of 31 residents (39.2%) and 26 staff members (49.1%) were infected with COVID-19. All residents and staff received two doses of a vaccine approximately 7 months prior. Ten residents with severe hypoxemia could not be transferred to a hospital due to a shortage of beds for COVID-19 patients. Within 90 days of the onset of the outbreak, 8 residents with COVID-19 (25.8%) died. A total of 48.4% of residents with COVID-19 developed 1 or more comorbidities. Viral genome analysis showed that the outbreak was caused by the Omicron BA.1.1.2 variant. CONCLUSIONS: Despite vaccination, high mortality and morbidity were observed in the COVID-19 outbreak due to the Omicron variant. Limiting medical care for residents with COVID-19 in facilities that experience ongoing outbreaks may be needed to reduce the risk of mortality among nursing home residents."	"1527-3296

This study compares the immunogenicity and clinical effectiveness of BNT162B2 versus ChAdOx1 in haemodialysis patients. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, 1021 patients were followed-up from time of vaccination until December 2021. All patients underwent weekly RT-PCR screening. Patients were assessed for nucleocapsid(anti-NP) and spike(anti-S) antibodies at timepoints after second(V2) and third(V3) vaccinations. 191 patients were investigated for T-cell responses. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) for prevention of infection, hospitalisation and mortality was evaluated using the formula VE=(1-adjustedHR)x100. FINDINGS: 45.7% (467/1021) had evidence of prior infection. There was no difference in the proportion of infection-naïve patients who seroconverted by vaccine type, but median anti-S antibody titres were higher post-BNT162b2 compared with ChAdOx1; 462(152-1171) and 78(20-213) BAU/ml respectively, p<0.001.  Concomitant immunosuppressant use was a risk factor for non-response, OR 0.12[95% CI 0.05-0.25] p<0.001.  Post-V3 (all BNT162b2), median anti-S antibody titres remained higher in those receiving BNT162b2 versus ChAdOx1 as primary doses; 2756(187-1246) and 1250(439-2635) BAU/ml respectively, p=0.003.Anti-S antibodies waned over time. Hierarchical levels of anti-S post-V2 predicted risk of infection; patients with no/low anti-S being at highest risk. VE for preventing infection, hospitalisation and death was 53% (95% CI 6-75), 77% (95% CI 30-92) and 93% (95% CI 59-99) respectively, with no difference seen by vaccine type. INTERPRETATION: Serum anti-S concentrations predict risk of breakthrough infection. Anti-S responses vary dependent upon clinical features, infection history and vaccine type. Monitoring of serological responses may enable individualised approaches to vaccine boosters in at risk populations.

This was demonstrated in several studies, mostly retrospective or based in mathematical models. The objective was to compare mortality in inpatients with COVID-19 related to vaccination. METHODS: Longitudinal, prospective, comparative, observational study. Inpatients with COVID-19 diagnosis were included between 17/12/2021 and 23/02/22, in Hospital Nacional Prof. A Posadas and Hospital Interzonal General de Agudos Eva Perón. RESULTS: Inpatients (245) were analyzed, finding an overall mortality of 25.3%, 16.8% in fully vaccinated patients (two or more doses with less than 150 days since the last dose until the COVID-19 test) and 31.9% in those with incomplete vaccination (unvaccinated, one dose or two or more doses with more than 150 days since the last dose) (p = 0.007), OR 2.31 (IC95; 1.25-4.28) for incomplete vaccination. Mortality was 32.2% in patients who developed pneumonia, 22.2% for fully vaccinated and 38% for incompletely vaccinated (p = 0.048), OR 2.15(IC95; 1.01-4.58). Mortality was associated with older age (70 vs. 59 years; p < 0.001), female sex (54.8% vs. 37.7%; p < 0.02) and oncologic disease (27.4 vs. 14.8%; p = 0.02). PESI score was higher in incompletely vaccinated (102.5 vs. 93, p = 0.05) and SOFA score was lower (2 vs. 3, p = 0.01). The necessary number to treat (NNT) to prevent one death was 7 patients for the overall sample (IC95;4-22) and 6 (IC95;3-106) for pneumonia. DISCUSSION: This study constitutes a starting point for developing other investigations and raising awareness of medical community and people about the beneficial effects of vaccination."	"1669-9106

This paper summarizes the outcomes of a case-control study conducted in Romania between March 2020 and October 2021 on patients previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. A case-control study was implemented after identification of 62 breakthrough cases. These cases were matched by age and gender to a 1:1 ratio with a control group of unvaccinated patients with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection status. There were no significant differences in the severity of cases and mortality between the study groups. However, unvaccinated patients had a shorter protection from natural immunity than patients with full vaccination status (58 days versus 89 days). The unvaccinated cases with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection were also statistically more likely to have a longer hospital admission duration (12.4 days versus 9.8 days), and required more non-invasive oxygen supplementation during their stay than breakthrough cases (37.1% versus 19.4%). Individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not vaccinated are not at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection or mortality compared to those who were completely vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine Comirnaty(®) Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 and acquired a breakthrough infection within 2-3 months of the previous infection with a Beta or Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. Although our findings are consistent with natural immunity offering similar short-term protection to a second dose of mRNA vaccine, all eligible individuals should be provided with immunization to lower their risk of infection, even if they have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2."

Vaccine development efforts have led to authorized candidates reducing hospitalizations and mortality, although variant emergence remains a concern. Peru faced a significant impact due to healthcare deficiencies. This study employed logistic regression to mathematically model COVID-19's dynamics in Peru over three years and assessed the correlations between cases, deaths, and people vaccinated. We estimated the critical time (t(c)) for cases (627 days), deaths (389 days), and people vaccinated (268 days), which led to the maximum speed values on those days. Negative correlations were identified between people vaccinated and cases (-0.40) and between people vaccinated and deaths (-0.75), suggesting reciprocal relationships between those pairs of variables. In addition, Granger causality tests determined that the vaccinated population dynamics can be used to forecast the behavior of deaths (p-value < 0.05), evidencing the impact of vaccinations against COVID-19. Also, the coefficient of determination (R(2)) indicated a robust representation of the real data. Using the Peruvian context as an example case, the logistic model's projections of cases, deaths, and vaccinations provide crucial insights into the pandemic, guiding public health tactics and reaffirming the essential role of vaccinations and resource distribution for an effective fight against COVID-19."

Epidemiologic studies suggest a potential benefit of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 outcomes. Differential past BCG vaccination policies between the former East and West German states provides a unique natural experiment to assess the potential effect of prior BCG vaccination on COVID-19. We estimated a 5% heterologous vaccine efficacy in the highly vaccinated former East Germany using the COVID-19 International Modeling (CoMo) Consortium model. A comparable BCG vaccination campaign undertaken prior to the pandemic in former West Germany, instituted along with known country-wide transmission reduction measures, is associated with a 37% decrease in projected mortality by mid-summer, 2020. These findings support a combined heterologous vaccine and non-pharmaceutical interventions (HVI+NPI) approach to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic until SARS-CoV-2 specific vaccines are widely distributed."

mortality"	"Background: Patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis are particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19 as a result of older age and multimorbidities. Objectives: Data are still limited and there are no published data on mortality in hemodialyzed patients in Poland, in particular when vaccines became available. We assessed the epidemiologic and clinical data of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and assessed the mortality in 2019, 2020, and 2021, as well as the vaccination rate in 2021. Patients and Methods: Retrospectively collected data from 73 Fresenius Nephrocare Poland hemodialysis centers and one public unit were analyzed. Results: In 2021, the vaccination rate was 96%. The unadjusted mortality (number of deaths divided by number of patients) in 2019 was 18.8%, while the unadjusted (after exclusion of COVID-related deaths) mortality in 2020 was 20.8%, and mortality in 2021 was 16.22%. The prevalence of cardiovascular deaths in 2019 and 2020 was almost identical (41.4% vs. 41.2%, respectively), and in 2021, the figures increased slightly to 44.1%. The prevalence of sudden cardiac deaths in 2019 was higher than in 2020 (19.6% vs. 17.3%, respectively) and consequently decreased in 2021 (10.0%), as well as strokes (6.2% vs. 5.4%, and 3.31% in 2021), whereas deaths due to gastrointestinal tract diseases were lower (2.5% vs. 3.2%, and 2.25% in 2021), diabetes complications (0.5% vs. 1.3%, and 0.5% in 2021), sepsis (5.1% vs. 6.3%, and 8.79% in 2021), respiratory failure (1.2 vs. 1.6%, and 2.83% in 2021), and pneumonia (1.4% vs. 2.0%, and 0.82%). There were 1493 hemodialyzed COVID-19 positive patients, and among them, 191 died in 2020 (12.79%). In 2021, there were 1224 COVID-19 positive patients and 260 died (21.24%). The mortality of COVID-19 positive dialyzed patients contributed 13.39% in 2020 and 16.21% in 2021 of all recorded deaths. Conclusions: The mortality among HD patients was higher in 2021 than in 2020 and 2019, despite the very high vaccination rate of up to 96%. The higher non-COVID-19 mortality may be due to the limited possibility of hospitalization and dedicated care during the pandemic. This information is extremely important in order to develop methods to protect this highly vulnerable patient group. Prevention plays a key role; other measures are essential in the mitigation and spread of COVID-19 in HD centers."	"2076-393x

METHODS AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of individuals vaccinated against COVID-19 from February 14, 2021 through January 2022. Data were retrieved from the Palestinian Ministry of Health database and included identity number, date of birth, vaccination date, vaccine type, and mortality. RESULTS: The study included 16,726 individuals who were vaccinated and later diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean age was 42.1 years, and females comprised 48.5% (8,112) of the population. Only 62.7% of individuals adhered to receiving the second dose of a vaccine, and the average duration of effectiveness of all vaccines was 126 days after completing the double dose. Seventy-five COVID-related deaths were recorded among vaccinated individuals who were significantly older ages. CONCLUSION: Our study design demonstrated the disparity in vaccine uptake and adherence due to delay in vaccination and dependence on COVAX and other countries for the donated vaccines. It highlights the importance of a global approach and higher-income countries assisting lower-income countries in securing vaccine."	"2278-7135

Thromboembolic events have been reported after administration of vaccines. We aim to systematically review thromboembolic events reported after COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: The available literature was systematically screened for available data on thromboembolic events after COVID-19 vaccination. Data were extracted from selected studies and analyzed for site of thromboembolism as well as other risk factors. All data were pooled to determine cumulative incidence of thromboembolism at various sites after vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies were selected for the final analysis. The mean age of the population was 48.5 ± 15.4 years (females - 67.4%). The mean time to event after vaccination was 10.8 ± 7.2 days. Venous thrombosis (74.8%, n = 214/286) was more common than arterial thrombosis (27.9%, n = 80/286). Cerebral sinus thrombosis was the most common manifestation (28.3%, n = 81/286) of venous thrombosis followed by deep vein thrombosis (19.2%, n = 49/254). Myocardial infarction was common (20.1%, n = 55/274) in patients with arterial thrombosis followed by ischemic stroke (8.02%, n = 22/274). Concurrent thrombosis at multiple sites was noted in 15.4% patients. Majority of patients had thrombocytopenia (49%) and antiplatelet factor 4 antibodies (78.6%). Thromboembolic events were mostly reported after the AstraZeneca vaccine (93.7%). Cerebral sinus thrombosis was the most common among thromboembolic events reported after the AstraZeneca vaccine. Among the reported cases, mortality was noted in 29.9% patients. CONCLUSIONS: Thromboembolic events can occur after COVID-19 vaccination, most commonly after the AstraZeneca vaccine. Cerebral sinus thrombosis is the most common manifestation noted in vaccinated individuals."	"1615-5947

DESIGN: Mathematical modelling. SETTINGS: Indian epidemic of COVID-19 and vulnerable population. DATA SOURCES: Country-specific and age-segregated pattern of social contact, case fatality rate and demographic data obtained from peer-reviewed literature and public domain. MODEL: An age-structured dynamical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in India incorporating uncertainty in natural history parameters was constructed. INTERVENTIONS: Comparison of different vaccine strategies by targeting priority groups such as keyworkers including healthcare professionals, individuals with comorbidities (24-60 years old) and all above 60. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence reduction and averted deaths in different scenarios, assuming that the current restrictions are fully lifted as vaccination is implemented. RESULTS: The priority groups together account for about 18% of India's population. An infection-preventing vaccine with 60% efficacy covering all these groups would reduce peak symptomatic incidence by 20.6% (95% uncertainty intervals (UI) 16.7-25.4) and cumulative mortality by 29.7% (95% CrI 25.8-33.8). A similar vaccine with ability to prevent symptoms (but not infection) will reduce peak incidence of symptomatic cases by 10.4% (95% CrI 8.4-13.0) and cumulative mortality by 32.9% (95% CrI 28.6-37.3). In the event of insufficient vaccine supply to cover all priority groups, model projections suggest that after keyworkers, vaccine strategy should prioritise all who are >60 and subsequently individuals with comorbidities. In settings with weakest transmission, such as sparsely populated rural areas, those with comorbidities should be prioritised after keyworkers. CONCLUSIONS: An appropriately targeted vaccination strategy would witness substantial mitigation of impact of COVID-19 in a country like India with wide heterogeneity. 'Smart vaccination', based on public health considerations, rather than mass vaccination, appears prudent."	"2044-6055

We aimed to estimate booster dose VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity in the general population and in comorbid patients. METHOD: A retrospective test-negative control study was undertaken in Galicia-Spain (December 2020-November 2021). VE and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: 1,512,415 (94.13%) negative and 94,334 (5.87%) positive SARS-CoV-2 test results were included. A booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine is associated with substantially higher protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection than vaccination without a booster [VE(boosted) = 87% (95%CI: 83%; 89%); VE(non-boosted) = 66% (95%CI: 65%; 67%)]. The high VE was observed in all ages, but was more pronounced in subjects older than 65 years. VE against COVID-19 severity was analyzed in a mixed population of boosted and non-boosted individuals and considerable protection was obtained [VE: hospitalization = 72% (95%CI: 68%; 75%); intensive care unit administration = 83% (95%CI: 78%; 88%), in-hospital mortality = 66% (95%CI: 53%; 75%)]. Boosted comorbid patients are more protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection than those who were non-boosted. This was observed in a wide range of major diseases including cancer (81% versus 54%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (84% versus 61%), diabetes (84% versus 65%), hypertension (82% versus 65%) and obesity (91% versus 67%), among others. CONCLUSIONS: A booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine increases the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity in the general population and in comorbid patients."	"1096-0953

Vaccine hesitancy has led to a decrease in vaccine uptake; driven by misinformation, fear, and misperceptions of vaccine safety. Whole inactivated vaccines have been used in one-fifth of the vaccine recipients in Africa, however there are limited real-world data on their safety. We evaluated the reported adverse events and factors associated with reported adverse events following vaccination with whole inactivated COVID-19 vaccines-BBiBP-CorV (Sinopharm) and CoronaVac (Sinovac). A quantitative survey evaluating attitudes and adverse events from vaccination was administered to 1016 adults presenting at vaccination centers. Two follow-up telephone interviews were conducted to determine adverse events after the first and second vaccination dose. Overall, the vaccine was well tolerated; 26.0% and 14.4% reported adverse events after the first and second dose, respectively. The most frequent local and systemic adverse events were pain at the injection site and headaches, respectively. Most symptoms were mild, and no participants required hospitalization. Participants who perceived COVID-19 vaccines as safe or had a personal COVID-19 experience were significantly less likely to report adverse events. Our findings provide data on the safety and tolerability of whole inactivated COVID-19 vaccines in an African population, providing the necessary data to create effective strategies to increase vaccination and support vaccination campaigns."

The development of vaccines was a milestone. By June 2022, billions of people have been vaccinated against the deadly virus. However, like any other vaccine, the various vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also cause a variety of adverse effects. Therefore this study aimed to determine the different acute side effects experienced after receiving the vaccines and correlating them with some socio-demographic and biomedical factors.  Methodology This cross-sectional study has a sample size of 467. Study participants were recruited after fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria. After gaining approval from the Ethical Review Board (ERB) of CMH Lahore Medical College and Institute of Dentistry, Lahore, Pakistan, an online questionnaire was distributed via social media. The survey questionnaire had a series of questions regarding the socio-demographic and biomedical characteristics of the participants, as well as the type of vaccine they got, followed by questions about the development of adverse effects after each dose (first and second). Data were statistically analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0 (Released 2017; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). The analysis was carried out in a confidence range of 95%, and a p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results Sinopharm (76.0%) was the most frequently received vaccine. Adverse events were reported more after the first dose (79.7%) than in the second (67.2%) (p value 0.001). The reported adverse events after either dose were of mild intensity (p<0.05). None of the individuals reported serious adverse events or hospitalization after getting the shots. Females, younger age groups, and individuals with BMI in the underweight category were more prone to developing symptoms and experiencing difficulty doing routine work after getting the doses. The associations were statistically significant (p<0.05). Blood group (A,B,0,AB), past COVID-19 history, and smoking status were not positively associated with the appearance of symptoms after either dose or with inconvenience doing daily work post-vaccination. Conclusion The vaccines developed against COVID-19 offer benefits that outweigh the few mild adverse effects experienced. None of these symptoms is severe enough to stop an individual from doing routine work or result in morbidity or mortality. Therefore, people should avoid any hesitancy towards getting vaccinated to get past this pandemic."	"2168-8184

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest plays a significant role in the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 using computed tomography severity scoring (CT-SS). Numerous vaccines are being made available in the world to lessen the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of the current study is to compare the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia using CT-SS in COVID-19-positive vaccinated (Covishield/Oxford-AstraZeneca) and non-vaccinated individuals and to compare the final outcome wherever possible. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This observational study was carried out from March 2021 to April 2021. Forty vaccinated and 40 non-vaccinated RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 patients who underwent CT chest during the 4-12(th) day of illness formed the material of the study. Semi-quantitative scoring was used, and CT-SS was calculated based on the extent of lobar involvement in all the patients. CT-SS was then compared between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups and the results analysed. RESULTS: CT scans were performed in 80 patients (40 patients each in the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups). The majority of patients in the vaccinated group had mild (42.5%) and moderate (37.5%) CT-SS while the majority of patients in the non-vaccinated group had moderate (52.5%) and severe (27.5%) CT-SS score on chest CT. Also, no mortality was observed in the vaccinated group, with 2 deaths in the non-vaccinated group. CONCLUSIONS: Covishield vaccine administration reduces the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia as compared to the nonvaccinated group, with a marked reduction in mortality."	"1899-0967

Data on outcomes of vaccine deployment in low- or middle-income countries are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the pragmatic application of the 3 COVID-19 vaccines available in Argentina, 2 of which have no reports of evaluation in real-world settings to date, were associated with a reduction in morbidity, all-cause mortality, and mortality due to COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used individual and ecological data to explore outcomes following vaccination with rAd26-rAd5, ChAdOx1, and BBIBP-CorV. To correct for differences in exposure times, results are shown using incidence density per 100 000 person-days from the start of the vaccination campaign (December 29, 2020) to the occurrence of an event or the end of follow-up (May 15, 2021). Participants included 663 602 people aged at least 60 years residing in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Statistical analysis was performed from June 1 to June 15, 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, death from all causes, and death within 30 days of a diagnosis of COVID-19. Poisson regression models were fitted to estimate associations with all 3 outcomes. RESULTS: Among 663 602 residents of the city of Buenos Aires included in the study, 540 792 (81.4%) were vaccinated with at least 1 dose, with 457 066 receiving 1 dose (mean [SD] age, 74.5 (8.9) years; 61.5% were female [n = 281 284]; 68.0% [n = 310 987] received the rAd26-rAd5 vaccine; 29.5% [n = 135 036] received ChAdOx1; 2.4% [n = 11 043] received BBIBP-CorV) and 83 726 receiving 2 doses (mean [SD] age, 73.4 [6.8] years; 63.5% were female [n = 53 204]). The incidence density of confirmed COVID-19 was 36.25 cases/100 000 person-days (95% CI, 35.80-36.70 cases/100 000 person-days) among those who did not receive a vaccine, 19.13 cases/100 000 person-days (95% CI, 18.63-19.62 cases/100 000 person-days) among those who received 1 dose, and 4.33 cases/100 000 person-days (95% CI, 3.85-4.81 cases/100 000 person-days) among those who received 2 doses. All-cause mortality was 11.74 cases/100 000 person-days (95% CI, 11.51-11.96 cases/100 000 person-days), 4.01 cases/100 000 person-days (95% CI, 3.78-4.24 cases/100 000 person-days) and 0.40 cases/100 000 person-days (95% CI, 0.26-0.55 cases/100 000 person-days). COVID-19-related-death rate was 2.31 cases/100 000 person-days (95% CI, 2.19-2.42 cases/100 000 person-days), 0.59 cases/100 000 person-days (95% CI, 0.50-0.67 cases/100 000 person-days), and 0.04 cases/100 000 person-days (95% CI, 0.0-0.09 cases/100 000 person-days) among the same groups. A 2-dose vaccination schedule was associated with an 88.1% (95% CI, 86.8%-89.2%) reduction in documented infection, 96.6% (95% CI, 95.3%-97.5%) reduction in all-cause death, and 98.3% (95% CI, 95.3%-99.4%) reduction in COVID-19-related death. A single dose was associated with a 47.2% (95% CI, 44.2%-50.1%) reduction in documented infection, 65.8% (95% CI, 61.7%-69.5%) reduction in all-cause death, and 74.5% (95% CI, 66%-80.8%) reduction in COVID-19-related death. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that within the first 5 months after the start of the vaccination campaign, vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in COVID-19 infection as well as a reduction in mortality."

We aimed to estimate COVID-19 VE against severe disease and death in the Greek population, for all vaccines currently in use. Nationwide active surveillance and vaccination registry data during January-December 2021 were used to estimate VE via quasi-Poisson regression, adjusted for age and calendar time. Interaction terms were included to assess VE by age group, against the "delta" severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variant and waning of VE over time. Two doses of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccines offered very high (>90%) VE against both intubation and death across all age groups, similar against both "delta" and previous variants, with one-dose Ad26.COV2.S slightly lower. VE waned over time but remained >80% at 6 months, and three doses increased VE again to near 100%. Vaccination prevented an estimated 19 691 COVID-19 deaths (95% confidence interval: 18 890-20 788) over the study period. All approved vaccines offer strong and also durable protection against COVID-19 severe disease and death. Every effort should be made to vaccinate the population with at least two doses, to reduce the mortality and morbidity impact of the pandemic."	"1096-9071

Pandemic"	"BACKGROUND: It has been claimed that COVID-19 vaccination is associated with excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic, a claim that contributes to vaccine hesitancy. We examined whether all-cause mortality has actually increased in Cyprus during the first two pandemic years, and whether any increases are associated with vaccination rates. METHODS: We calculated weekly excess mortality for Cyprus between January 2020 and June 2022, overall and by age group, using both a Distributed Lag Nonlinear Model (DLNM) adjusted for mean daily temperature, and the EuroMOMO algorithm. Excess deaths were regressed on the weekly number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths and on weekly first-dose vaccinations, also using a DLNM to explore the lag-response dimension. RESULTS: 552 excess deaths were observed in Cyprus during the study period (95% CI: 508-597) as opposed to 1306 confirmed COVID-19 deaths. No association between excess deaths and vaccination rates was found overall and for any age group except 18-49 years, among whom 1.09 excess deaths (95% CI: 0.27-1.91) per 10,000 vaccinations were estimated during the first 8 weeks post-vaccination. However, detailed cause-of-death examination identified just two such deaths potentially linked to vaccination, therefore this association is spurious and attributable to random error. CONCLUSIONS: Excess mortality was moderately increased in Cyprus during the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily as a result of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths. No relationship was found between vaccination rates and all-cause mortality, demonstrating the excellent safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines."	"1873-2518

We aimed to estimate the mortality rate of COVID-19 vaccination and presented characteristics of deaths following COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: Data on deaths following COVID-19 vaccination were obtained from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from December 11, 2020 through January 8, 2021. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Tracker was used to identify the total number of people receiving COVID-19 vaccines during the same period to estimate the mortality rate. Stratified analysis was conducted by the location of vaccination. Results: As of January 8, 2021, 55 deaths were reported, and the mortality rate of COVID-19 vaccination was 8.2 per million population. A total of 37 deaths were reported among long-term care facility residents, and the mortality rate was 53.4 per million population. Top reported comorbidities associated with deaths included hypertension, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and heart failure. In addition, dementia was more likely to be associated with deaths vaccinated at long-term care facilities than at other locations. Conclusion: The benefits of COVID-19 vaccines outweigh the potential risks in older frail populations, and our findings do not support actions to exclude older adults from being vaccinated. However, continued monitoring of COVID-19 vaccination is still warranted."	"2296-858x

Vaccine efficacy"	"Thailand faced a dilemma of which groups to prioritise with a limited first tranche of COVID-19 vaccinations in early 2021, at a time when there was low incidence and low mortality in the country. A mathematical modelling analysis was performed to compare the potential short-term impact of allocating the available doses to either the high severity group (over 65-year-olds) or the high transmission group (aged 20-39). At the time of the analysis, there was uncertainty about the precise characteristics of the vaccines available, in terms of their potential impact on transmission and reductions to the severity of infection. As such, a range of vaccine characteristic scenarios, with differing levels of severity and transmission reductions were explored. Using the evidence available at the time regarding severity reduction of infection due to the vaccines, the model suggested that vaccinating high severity group should be the priority if reductions in deaths is the priority. Vaccinating this group was found to have a direct impact on reducing the number of deaths, while the incidence and hospitalisations remained unchanged. However, the model found that vaccinating the high transmission group with a vaccine with sufficiently high protection against infection (more than 70%) could provide enough herd effects to delay the expected epidemic peak, resulting in both case and death reductions in both target groups. The model explored a 12-month time horizon. These analyses helped to inform the vaccination strategy in Thailand throughout 2021 and can inform future modelling studies for policymaking when the characteristics of vaccines are uncertain."

We report stroke incidence as an adverse event following immunization (AEFI) among recipients of 79,399,446 doses of 6 different SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCov-19, Gam-COVID-Vac, CoronaVac, Ad5-nCoV, and Ad26.COV2-S) between December 24, 2020, and August 31, 2021, in Mexico. METHODS: This retrospective descriptive study analyzed stroke incidence per million doses among hospitalized adult patients (≥18 years) during an 8-month interval. According to the World Health Organization, AEFIs were defined as clinical events occurring within 30 days after immunization and categorized as either nonserious or serious, depending on severity, treatment, and hospital admission requirements. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) cases were collected through a passive epidemiologic surveillance system in which local health providers report potential AEFI to the Mexican General Board of Epidemiology. Data were captured with standardized case report formats by an ad hoc committee appointed by the Mexican Ministry of Health to evaluate potential neurologic AEFI against SARS-COV-2. RESULTS: We included 56 patients (31 female patients [55.5%]) for an overall incidence of 0.71 cases per 1,000,000 administered doses (95% CI 0.54-0.92). Median age was 65 years (interquartile range [IQR] 55-76 years); median time from vaccination to stroke (of any subtype) was 2 days (IQR 1-5 days). In 27 (48.2%) patients, the event was diagnosed within the first 24 hours after immunization. The most frequent subtype was AIS in 43 patients (75%; 0.54 per 1,000,000 doses, 95% CI 0.40-0.73), followed by ICH in 9 (16.1%; 0.11 per 1,000,000 doses, 95% CI 0.06-0.22) and SAH and CVT, each with 2 cases (3.6%; 0.03 per 1,000,000 doses, 95% CI 0.01-0.09). Overall, the most common risk factors were hypertension in 33 (58.9%) patients and diabetes in 22 (39.3%). Median hospital length of stay was 6 days (IQR 4-13 days). At discharge, functional outcome was good (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) in 41.1% of patients; in-hospital mortality rate was 21.4%. DISCUSSION: Stroke is an exceedingly rare AEFI against SARS-CoV-2. Preexisting stroke risk factors were identified in most patients. Further research is needed to evaluate causal associations between SARS-COV-2 vaccines and stroke."	"1526-632x

DESIGN: Test negative case-control study. SETTING: Community testing for covid-19 in England. PARTICIPANTS: 156 930 adults aged 70 years and older who reported symptoms of covid-19 between 8 December 2020 and 19 February 2021 and were successfully linked to vaccination data in the National Immunisation Management System. INTERVENTIONS: Vaccination with BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were polymerase chain reaction confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, admissions to hospital for covid-19, and deaths with covid-19. RESULTS: Participants aged 80 years and older vaccinated with BNT162b2 before 4 January 2021 had a higher odds of testing positive for covid-19 in the first nine days after vaccination (odds ratio up to 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.77), indicating that those initially targeted had a higher underlying risk of infection. Vaccine effectiveness was therefore compared with the baseline post-vaccination period. Vaccine effects were noted 10 to 13 days after vaccination, reaching a vaccine effectiveness of 70% (95% confidence interval 59% to 78%), then plateauing. From 14 days after the second dose a vaccination effectiveness of 89% (85% to 93%) was found compared with the increased baseline risk. Participants aged 70 years and older vaccinated from 4 January (when ChAdOx1-S delivery commenced) had a similar underlying risk of covid-19 to unvaccinated individuals. With BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness reached 61% (51% to 69%) from 28 to 34 days after vaccination, then plateaued. With ChAdOx1-S, effects were seen from 14 to 20 days after vaccination, reaching an effectiveness of 60% (41% to 73%) from 28 to 34 days, increasing to 73% (27% to 90%) from day 35 onwards. On top of the protection against symptomatic disease, a further 43% (33% to 52%) reduced risk of emergency hospital admission and 51% (37% to 62%) reduced risk of death was observed in those who had received one dose of BNT162b2. Participants who had received one dose of ChAdOx1-S had a further 37% (3% to 59%) reduced risk of emergency hospital admission. Follow-up was insufficient to assess the effect of ChAdOx1-S on mortality. Combined with the effect against symptomatic disease, a single dose of either vaccine was about 80% effective at preventing admission to hospital with covid-19 and a single dose of BNT162b2 was 85% effective at preventing death with covid-19. CONCLUSION: Vaccination with either one dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic covid-19 in older adults, and with further protection against severe disease. Both vaccines showed similar effects. Protection was maintained for the duration of follow-up (>6 weeks). A second dose of BNT162b2 was associated with further protection against symptomatic disease. A clear effect of the vaccines against the B.1.1.7 variant was found."	"1756-1833

We aimed at investigating several factors affecting the SARS-CoV-2 IgG Spike (S) antibody responses on admission and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 disease in fully vaccinated, hospitalized patients. METHODS: 102 subjects were enrolled in the study. Blood serum samples were collected from each patient upon admission for the semiquantitative determination of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG S levels with lateral flow assays. Factors influencing vaccine responses were documented. RESULTS: 27 subjects had a negative antibody test upon hospital admission. Out of the 102 patients admitted to the hospital, 88 were discharged and 14 died. Both the absence of anti-S SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and poor clinical outcomes of COVID-19 disease were associated with older age, lower Ct values, and a shorter period between symptom onset and hospital admission. Ct values and time between symptom onset and hospitalization were independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 IgG S responses upon admission. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio was identified as an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Host- and disease-associated factors can predict SARS-CoV-2 IgG S responses and mortality in hospitalized patients with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 Infection."	"2075-4426

In-hospital mortality
Vaccine"	"BACKGROUND: The ongoing Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has hit Brazil hard in period of different dominant variants. Different COIVD-19 variants have swept through the region, resulting that the total number of cases in Brazil is the third highest in the world. This study is aimed at investigating the regional heterogeneity of in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 in Brazil and the effects of vaccination and social inequality. METHODS: We fitted a multivariate mixed-effects Cox model to a national database of inpatient data in Brazil who were admitted for COVID-19 from February 27, 2020 to March 15, 2022. The in-hospital mortality risks of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients were compared, with adjustment for age, state, ethnicity, education and comorbidities. And the effects of variables to in-hospital mortality were also compared. Stratified analysis was conducted across different age groups and vaccine types. RESULTS: By fitting the multivariate mixed-effects Cox model, we concluded that age was the most important risk factor for death. With regards to educational level, illiterate patients (hazard ratio: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.56-1.70) had a higher risk than those with a university or college degree. Some common comorbidities were more dangerous for hospitalized patients, such as liver disease (HR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.34-1.59) and immunosuppression (HR:1.32, 95% CI: 1.26-1.40). In addition, the states involving Sergipe (HR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.46-2.11), Roraima (HR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.43-1.92), Maranhão (HR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.38-1.79), Acre (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.12-1.86), and Rondônia (HR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.10-1.44) in the north and the northeast region tended to have higher hazard ratios than other area. In terms of vaccine protection, vaccination did not significantly reduce mortality among hospitalized patients. Sinovac and AstraZeneca offered different protection in different regions, and no vaccine provided high protection in all regions. CONCLUSION: The study revealed the regional heterogeneity of in-hospital mortality of Covid-19 in Brazil and the effects of vaccination and social inequality. We found that ethnic concentrations were consistent with higher proportion of death cases relative to population size. White Brazilians had more frequent international travel opportunities. As race revealed the intersection of social connections, we speculated that uneven interactions with residential communities partially contribute to the spread of the epidemic. Additionally, the vaccine showed different protection in different regions. In the northern and northeastern regions, AstraZeneca was much more protective than Sinovac, while Sinovac was more protective for hospitalized patients with varying numbers of comorbidities in the Central-west, Southeast and South regions."

METHODS: Subjects were patients with T2DM who were administered by general practitioner (GP). Use electronic exchange platform to obtain the information on COVID-19 vaccination, all-cause deaths and risk factors. Logistic regression models were used to calculate the odd ratio (OR) and 95% CI for the association between COVID-19 vaccination and mortality. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as (1- adjusted OR) × 100%. RESULTS: A total of 26,916 subjects had 53.81%, 17.65%, and 23.43% coverage for the booster, full, and partial COVID-19 vaccination, reported 328 deaths and a mortality of 1.2%. The adjusted OR (95%CI) was 0.85(0.60-1.21) for those received partial vaccination, 0.31(0.22-0.43) for those received full vaccination, and 0.12(0.08-0.18) for those received booster vaccination, compared to the unvaccinated individuals. The VE (95%CI) was 88.00%(82.30-91.80) of booster vaccination, 69.30%(56.60-78.30) of full vaccination, and 17.60%(-17.10-42.00) of partial vaccination. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccination could effectively prevent the all-cause death in patients with T2DM during the omicron variant outbreak period, after the cancellation of the "Dynamic Zero Policy" in mainland China."

Waning effectiveness"	"BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against COVID-19 and all-cause mortality across different pandemic periods in 2022. METHODS: We used linked whole-of-population data from the 2021 Australian Census, Australian Immunisation Register, death registrations and other national datasets including migration data. Among 3.8 million adults aged 65+ years and >170,000 aged care residents, we used survival analysis to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 specific mortality and all-cause mortality, by vaccine dose and time since receipt, adjusted for age, sex and other factors. We also estimated absolute COVID-19 mortality rates. FINDINGS: From January-May 2022 (Omicron BA.1/2), 3250 COVID-19 deaths occurred; from June-November (Omicron BA.4/5) 3185 COVID-19 deaths occurred. During January-May, VE of a 3rd COVID-19 vaccine dose within 3 months was 93% (95% CI 93-94%) whilst VE of a 2nd dose >6 months since receipt was 34% (26-42%). During June-November, VE of a 4th COVID-19 vaccine dose within 3 months was 84% (82-86%) whilst VE of a 3rd dose >6 months since receipt was 56% (50-62%). VE estimates for aged care residents were similar, but absolute risk reductions were substantially greater. During June-November 2022, for all-cause mortality, VE of a 4th dose within 3 months was 58% (56-59%) whilst VE of a 3rd dose >6 months since receipt was 19% (16-22%). INTERPRETATIONS: COVID-19 vaccination is highly effective against COVID-19 mortality among older adults although effectiveness wanes with time since the last dose. Our findings emphasise the importance of continuing to administer booster doses, particularly to those at highest risk. FUNDING: This study was funded by the Health Economics Research Division in the Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care."	"2666-6065

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the time-varying association of primary and booster COVID-19 vaccination and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort study of 10.6 million residents in North Carolina from March 2, 2020, through June 3, 2022. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 primary vaccine series and boosters and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rate ratio (RR) of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hazard ratio (HR) of COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. RESULTS: The median age among the 10.6 million participants was 39 years; 51.3% were female, 71.5% were White, and 9.9% were Hispanic. As of June 3, 2022, 67% of participants had been vaccinated. There were 2 771 364 SARS-CoV-2 infections, with a hospitalization rate of 6.3% and mortality rate of 1.4%. The adjusted RR of the primary vaccine series compared with being unvaccinated against infection became 0.53 (95% CI, 0.52-0.53) for BNT162b2, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.51-0.53) for mRNA-1273, and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.50-0.53) for Ad26.COV2.S 10 months after the first dose, but the adjusted HR for hospitalization remained at 0.29 (95% CI, 0.24-0.35) for BNT162b2, 0.27 (95% CI, 0.23-0.32) for mRNA-1273, and 0.35 (95% CI, 0.29-0.42) for Ad26.COV2.S and the adjusted HR of death remained at 0.23 (95% CI, 0.17-0.29) for BNT162b2, 0.15 (95% CI, 0.11-0.20) for mRNA-1273, and 0.24 (95% CI, 0.19-0.31) for Ad26.COV2.S. For the BNT162b2 primary series, boosting in December 2021 with BNT162b2 had the adjusted RR relative to primary series of 0.39 (95% CI, 0.38-0.40) and boosting with mRNA-1273 had the adjusted RR of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.30-0.34) against infection after 1 month and boosting with BNT162b2 had the adjusted RR of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.82-0.86) and boosting with mRNA-1273 had the adjusted RR of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.57-0.62) after 3 months. Among all participants, the adjusted RR of Omicron infection compared with no prior infection was estimated at 0.23 (95% CI, 0.22-0.24) against infection, and the adjusted HRs were 0.10 (95% CI, 0.07-0.14) against hospitalization and 0.11 (95% CI, 0.08-0.15) against death after 4 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Receipt of primary COVID-19 vaccine series compared with being unvaccinated, receipt of boosters compared with primary vaccination, and prior infection compared with no prior infection were all significantly associated with lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (including Omicron) and resulting hospitalization and death. The associated protection waned over time, especially against infection."	"1538-3598

Data are limited regarding long-term HCT survivors' uptake of and experiences with COVID-19 vaccination and infection. This study aimed to characterize COVID-19 vaccination uptake, use of other prevention measures, and COVID-19 infection outcomes in adult HCT recipients at our institution. Between July 1, 2021, and June 30, 2022, long-term adult HCT survivors were surveyed regarding overall health, chronic graft-versus-host (cGVHD) status, and experiences with COVID-19 vaccinations, prevention measures, and infections. Patients reported COVID-19 vaccination status, vaccine-related adverse effects, use of nonpharmaceutical prevention measures, and infections. Comparisons by response and vaccination status were performed using the chi-square test and Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. Of 4758 adult HCT survivors who underwent HCT between 1971 and 2021 and consented to participate in annual surveys, 1719 (36%) completed the COVID-19 module, and 1598 of 1705 (94%) reported receiving ≥1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Severe vaccine-related adverse effects were infrequent (5%). Among respondents receiving an mRNA vaccine, completion of doses according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations at the time of survey return was 2 doses in 675 of 759 (89%), 3 doses in 610 of 778 (78%), and 4 doses in 26 of 55 (47%). Two hundred fifty respondents (15%) reported COVID-19 infection; 25 (10%) required hospitalization. Vaccinated respondents reported significantly higher uptake of household vaccination (1284 of 1404 [91%] versus 18 of 88 [20%]; P < .001) and the use of nonpharmaceutical interventions (P < .001). Vaccinated respondents were significantly less likely to have contracted COVID-19 (85 of 1480 [6%] versus 130 of 190 [68%]; P < .001), as were their household members (149 of 1451 [10%] versus 85 of 185 [46%]; P < .001). Receipt of additional COVID-19 vaccine doses beyond the first dose was associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 infection (odds ratio, .63; 95% confidence interval, .47 to .85; P = .002). Vaccination was well tolerated and associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 infection among HCT survivors and their household contacts. Vaccination and booster doses should be encouraged as part of a multifaceted approach in this high-risk population."	"2666-6367

Thrombotic thrombocytopenia"	"OBJECTIVES: SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic, with little prevention or treatment options. More than 600 million mortalities have been documented from SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the majority of fatalities occurring among elderly patients (aged >65 years). A number of vaccines have been developed in an effort to restrain the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the widespread administration of these vaccines, substantial side or undesired effects in multiple organ systems have emerged, necessitating essential critical care. Herein, we tabulate the adverse cardiovascular responses resulting from COVID-19 vaccines. DESIGN OR METHODS: We searched PubMed for articles published through April, 2022, with the terms "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID-19", "cardiovascular", "SARS-CoV-2 vaccines", "COVID-19 vaccines", "myocarditis", "pericarditis", "thrombosis", "thrombocytopenia", "vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia", "acute coronary syndrome", "myocardial infarction", "hypertension", "arrythmia", "postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome", "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy", "cardiac arrest" and "death". We mainly selected publications from the past 3 years, but did not exclude widely referenced and highly regarded older publications. Besides, we searched the reference lists of articles identified by above search method and chose those we considered relevant. RESULTS: COVID-19 vaccines evoke rare but fatal thrombotic events, whereas messenger RNA\055based vaccines appear to be associated with risks of pericarditis/myocarditis, with the latter being more predominant in young adults following the second dose. Reports of other cardiovascular responses, including hypertension, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, and cardiac arrest, have also been indicated. CONCLUSION: The undesired cardiovascular complications remain infrequent, giveng the large number of vaccinations inoculated to general population. And lower mortality takes precedence over the undesired cardiovascular complications."	"1878-3511

This article reviewed COVID-19 outbreaks situation and estimated the effectiveness of receiving at least two-dose of COVID-19 vaccine in preventing severe outcomes. METHODS: To estimate attack rates and vaccination coverage, documentation on COVID-19 infection and their vaccination records of residential care homes (RCH) residents reported between December 31, 2021 and May 31, 2022 were reviewed, and infected cases were follow-up for 4 weeks for severe outcomes or death. Correlation between vaccination coverage against attack rate by types of homes was examined. Infected RCH residents with available information were included in the analysis of vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes and death. RESULTS: COVID-19 vaccination coverage was low in RCHDs (median 0.46, IQR: 0.24-0.76) and very low in RCHEs (median 0.08, IQR: 0.00-0.19). Higher attack rates were recorded among RCHE residents (median 0.84, IQR: 0.64-0.93) and higher case fatality rate (CFR: 28.1%) than in RCHDs (median 0.58, IQR: 0.31-0.84; CFR: 3.9%). The attack rate decreased when vaccination coverage increased for both RCHEs (ρ = -0.131, p < 0.001) and RCHDs (ρ = -0.333, p < 0.001). Comparing with infected residents who were unvaccinated/vaccinated with one-dose, receiving at least two-dose was estimated to be effective in reducing severe outcomes in 31% and 36% of infected RCHE and RCHD residents respectively; with greater reduction in mortality among RCHD than RCHE residents (54% and 38%, respectively). Vaccine effectiveness of two-dose of BNT162b2 against severe outcomes and death are higher than that of CoronaVac. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing COVID-19 vaccination could have significant impact on reducing the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in RCHs. At least two-dose of COVID-19 vaccine is still effective in reducing severe outcomes and death among infected residents in RCHs during Omicron epidemic."	"2772-431x

vaccine science and policy"	"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has reached millions of people worldwide and is responsible for millions of deaths around the world. Research on fatalities in rural communities remains limited. In addition, the scientific literature has not yet reported on the distribution of vaccines in Canada and compared the findings to the age distribution of COVID-19 fatalities in Canada to see whether the vaccines have been distributed to the highest age category populations. This research article used data from the Government of Ontario and Statistics Canada to analyze the number of cases, fatalities, case fatality rates (CFRs) by demographic factors, such as age, gender, urban-rural status, and compared the findings to national vaccination rates by age. As of June 11, 2021, this study found that among the 528,819 cases among 14.8 million people. Among this population, there were 8875 fatalities in Ontario with 82.208% (n=7296) of fatalities occurred in people over 70 years, and 93.183% in people over 60 years (n=8,270). Additionally, the odds ratio of a fatal event was 9,652 times higher in people over 90 years (95% CI: 4418, 31124, p<0.001) as compared with less than 20 years. Men had a higher number of fatalities (n=4,490, CFR=1.721%) compared with women (n=4,385, CFR=1.692%), and a higher odd of fatal events only when adjusted for age and gender (OR=1.66, 95% CI: 1.57, 1.74, p<0.001). Urban areas had 92.034% of fatalities (n=8,168) and had a CFR of 1.632%. In contrast, rural areas comprised 4.451% of total fatalities (n=395) and had the highest CFR (2.267%). The unadjusted odds of a fatality were 1.41 (95% CI: 1.27, 1.56) in rural areas compared with urban areas. Across Canada as of May 29, 2021, people over 80 years old received 1,530,318 vaccines with 91.98% of this population age group receiving at least one and 457,664 being fully vaccinated (27.51%). In Ontario, as the number of people with at least one vaccine increased for people over 90 years, the number of fatalities was reduced from about 8 per day prior to vaccines to approximately two per day. Furthermore, once the vaccination rates exceeded 75% in ages 60 years and over 50% in the younger age groups, the number of fatalities per day among all age groups was approximately one per day. In summary, age was found to be a significant factor for COVID-19 mortality in Ontario and vaccine uptake in Ontario was followed by decreases in COVID-19 mortality."	"2168-8184

Few studies have assessed their clinical efficacy, particularly against Omicron variants, as most included patients from earlier phases of the pandemic, with higher base mortality rates. METHODS: We studied adult OTRs who had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between 12/15/21 and 5/25/22. We compared clinical outcomes between those who had received 2 or ≥3 doses of an mRNA vaccine and concurrent unvaccinated controls. RESULTS: Among 103 OTRs, vaccination was associated with lower 90-day mortality (unvaccinated vs 2 vs ≥3 doses: 25% vs 7% vs 3%; P = .003), hospital (unvaccinated vs 2 vs ≥3 doses: 56% vs 37% vs 27%; P = .018) and intensive care unit (ICU; unvaccinated vs 2 vs ≥3 doses: 25% vs 15% vs 3%; P = .001) admission rates, and peak O(2) requirements (ordinal scale Kendall's tau b = -0.309 [lower scores, ie, O(2) requirements with more vaccine doses]; P = .003). Age (age >60 years: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 7.73; P = .016; administration of antispike monoclonal antibody: aHR, 0.17; P = .042) and vaccination, especially with ≥3 doses (aHR, 0.105; P = .01), were independently associated with 90-day mortality. Black (P = .021) and Hispanic (P = .016) OTRs were underrepresented among the vaccinated, especially in the ≥3-dose group. CONCLUSIONS: Despite lower mRNA vaccine efficacy in OTRs and against Omicron variants, vaccination protects this vulnerable patient population from severe COVID-19 and death. Ethnic and racial disparities in health care have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and warrant better community outreach efforts."	"2328-8957

As the virus keeps evolving to be more infectious and immune evasive, some question whether the COVID-19 pandemic can be managed through sustainable public health measures. METHODS: We developed an agent-based simulation to explore the impact of COVID-19 mutations, periodic vaccinations, and nonpharmaceutical interventions on reducing COVID-19 deaths. The model is calibrated to the greater Seattle area by observing local epidemic data. We perform scenario analyses on viral mutations that change infectiousness, disease severity, and immune evasiveness from previous infections and vaccination every 6 months. The simulation is run until the end of year 2023. RESULTS: Variants with increased infectivity or increased immune evasion dominate previous strains. With enhanced immune protection from a pancoronavirus vaccine, the most optimistic periodic vaccination rate reduces average total deaths by 44.6% compared with the most pessimistic periodic vaccination rate. A strict threshold nonpharmaceutical intervention policy reduces average total deaths by 71.3% compared with an open society, whereas a moderate nonpharmaceutical intervention policy results in a 33.6% reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the potential benefits of pancoronavirus vaccines that offer enhanced and longer-lasting immunity. We emphasize the crucial role of nonpharmaceutical interventions in reducing COVID-19 deaths regardless of virus mutation scenarios. Owing to highly immune evasive and contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants, most scenarios in this study fail to reduce the mortality of COVID-19 to the level of influenza and pneumonia. However, our findings indicate that periodic vaccinations and a threshold nonpharmaceutical intervention policy may succeed in achieving this goal. This indicates the need for caution and vigilance in managing a continuing COVID-19 epidemic."	"2773-0654

DESIGN: Data from the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Agency on AEs from 4 COVID-19 vaccines, including AZD1222, BNT162b2, JNJ-78436735, and mRNA-1273, from February 26, 2021, to August 21, 2021, were assessed. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical symptoms, severity, complications, and mortality were descriptively analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 36.3 million individuals who completed the COVID-19 vaccination doses during the study period were included, and 153,183 AEs were reported. Most AEs occurred after the first dose (80.6%) and within a day (63.2%) after vaccination. Of the AEs, 95.5% were nonsevere cases; however, 4.5% were severe. Most mild AEs showed a similar frequency across all age groups, but major severe AEs and mortality events increased with age. CONCLUSIONS: Although there were differences in the frequency of occurrence, various adverse reactions were confirmed in using all 4 COVID-19 vaccines, even with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine. Caution is needed, and further research should be continuously conducted."	"1878-3511

METHODS: The authors prospectively followed up 450 pregnant women receiving vaccination at a single center. Patients recorded prespecified adverse reactions via a mobile application up to 30 days after the first and second doses. Obstetrical and neonatal outcomes were compared with those of pregnant women, during the same period, who did not undergo vaccination. RESULTS: Among the 387 women who received the first dose and were followed up for 30 days, injection site pain, fatigue, injection site swelling, muscle ache, and headache were the most prevalent side effects. There were 4.7-, 5.7-, 7.1-, and 9.3-fold increases in fatigue, injection site swelling, muscle ache, and headache, respectively, among the 231 women who received the second dose. Most of the side effects resolved by 14 days and all resolved by 30 days after each doses. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in obstetrical and neonatal morbidity or mortality between the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. CONCLUSION: No serious adverse reactions were noted among pregnant women receiving messenger RNA vaccinations with comparable obstetrical and neonatal outcomes to unvaccinated pregnant women."

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: 21 hospitals across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 11 690 adults (≥18 years) admitted to hospital: 5728 with covid-19 (cases) and 5962 without covid-19 (controls). Patients were classified into SARS-CoV-2 variant groups based on viral whole genome sequencing, and, if sequencing did not reveal a lineage, by the predominant circulating variant at the time of hospital admission: alpha (11 March to 3 July 2021), delta (4 July to 25 December 2021), and omicron (26 December 2021 to 14 January 2022). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vaccine effectiveness calculated using a test negative design for mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 related hospital admissions by each variant (alpha, delta, omicron). Among patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, disease severity on the World Health Organization's clinical progression scale was compared among variants using proportional odds regression. RESULTS: Effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 associated hospital admissions was 85% (95% confidence interval 82% to 88%) for two vaccine doses against the alpha variant, 85% (83% to 87%) for two doses against the delta variant, 94% (92% to 95%) for three doses against the delta variant, 65% (51% to 75%) for two doses against the omicron variant; and 86% (77% to 91%) for three doses against the omicron variant. In-hospital mortality was 7.6% (81/1060) for alpha, 12.2% (461/3788) for delta, and 7.1% (40/565) for omicron. Among unvaccinated patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital, severity on the WHO clinical progression scale was higher for the delta versus alpha variant (adjusted proportional odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for the omicron versus delta variant (0.61, 0.49 to 0.77). Compared with unvaccinated patients, severity was lower for vaccinated patients for each variant, including alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio 0.33, 0.23 to 0.49), delta (0.44, 0.37 to 0.51), and omicron (0.61, 0.44 to 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: mRNA vaccines were found to be highly effective in preventing covid-19 associated hospital admissions related to the alpha, delta, and omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against the delta and alpha variants. Among adults admitted to hospital with covid-19, the omicron variant was associated with less severe disease than the delta variant but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality. Vaccinated patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 had significantly lower disease severity than unvaccinated patients for all the variants."	"1756-1833

We present a retrospective study of publicly available country-level data from 50 countries having the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at the end of September 2021. The mean values of country-level moving averages of R and CFR went down respectively from 1.118 and 6.3% on June 30, 2020 to 1.083 and 3.6% on September 30, 2020 and to 1.015 and 1.8% by September 30, 2021. In parallel, the 10%-90% inter-percentile range of R and CFR moving averages decreased, respectively, from 0.288 and 13.3% on June 30, 2020, to 0.151 and 7.7% on September 30, 2020, and to 0.107 and 3.3% by September 30, 2021. The slow decrease in the country-level moving averages of R, approaching the level of 1.0 and accompanied by repeated outbreaks ("waves") in various countries, may indicate that COVID-19 has reached its point of stable endemic equilibrium. A regression analysis implies that only a prohibitively high level of herd immunity (about 63%) may stop the endemic by reaching a stable disease-free equilibrium. It also appears that fully vaccinating about 70% of a country's population should be sufficient for bringing the CFR close to the level of the seasonal flu (about 0.1%). Thus, while the currently available vaccines prove to be effective in reducing the mortality from the existing COVID-19 variants, they are unlikely to stop the spread of the virus in the foreseeable future. It is noteworthy that government measures restricting people's behavior (such as lockdowns) were not found to have statistically significant effects in the analyzed data."	"2398-8835

OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to compare the prognosis of this condition with viral infection-related myocarditis over 180 days. METHODS: A territory-wide electronic public health care database in Hong Kong linked with population-based vaccination records was used to conduct a retrospective cohort study. Since the roll-out of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), patients aged ≥12 years hospitalized with myocarditis within 28 days after BNT162b2 vaccination were compared against viral infection-related myocarditis recorded before the pandemic (2000-2019), over a 180-day follow-up period (starting from diagnosis of myocarditis). All-cause mortality, heart failure, dilated cardiomyopathy, heart transplant, and postdischarge health care utilization were examined with Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: A total of 866 patients were included for analysis. Over the follow-up period, 1 death (1.0%) of 104 patients with postvaccination myocarditis and 84 deaths (11.0%) of 762 patients with viral infection-related myocarditis were identified. One case (1.0%) of dilated cardiomyopathy and 2 cases (1.9%) of heart failure were identified in the postvaccination group, compared with 28 (3.7%) and 93 (12.2%) in the viral infection-related myocarditis group, respectively. Adjusted analysis showed that the postvaccination myocarditis group had a 92% lower mortality risk (adjusted HR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01-0.57). No significant differences in other prognostic outcomes were seen. CONCLUSIONS: This study found a significantly lower rate of mortality among individuals with myocarditis after mRNA vaccination compared with those with viral infection-related myocarditis. Prognosis of this iatrogenic condition may be less severe than naturally acquired viral infection-related myocarditis."	"1558-3597

METHODS: Secondary data on COVID-19 deaths and vaccination coverage were retrieved to investigate COVID-19 mortality rate (MR) evolution as the vaccination against COVID-19 advanced in Brazil in 2021. Poisson regression with adjustment for age and Brazilian states was used to calculate the MR. RESULTS: By mid-April 2021, MR increased 2 - 3 times compared with the already high level in January for people aged 60 years or older, reaching the highest epidemic level of 5 - 15 per 100,000 inhabitants in this age group. Despite the following decline trend, by the end of May, the MR level was still about 50% and 80% higher for the age groups of 40 - 79 years and 80 years or older. The coverage concerning the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine reached 80% for people aged 60 - 69 years and exceeded 95% for those aged 70 years or older, but the second dose was only given to 26, 76 and 64% of the age groups of 60 - 69, 70 - 79, and 80 years or older, respectively. The age-standardized average MR over the study period was the highest in northern Brazilian states of Rondônia, Amazonas, Acre, and Roraima (range 6-8.4 per 100,000 inhabitants). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination coverage was below the level necessary to protect Brazilians from rising MR between January and May 2021. Urgent measures are necessary to increase the vaccine supply and the adherence to non-pharmacological protective measures."	"1980-5497

We look at a single country, Poland, and compare it with the European Union (EU) to contrast approaches and outcomes. Among possible relevant indices, we examine characteristics of COVID-19-related mortality and excess all-cause mortality from March 2020 to February 2022. We demonstrate that both the numbers of COVID-related deaths and all-cause deaths in Poland were much higher than the EU average for most months in the study period. We juxtapose the percentage of fully vaccinated population and cumulative COVID-19 deaths per million people for EU Member States and show that typically higher vaccination rates are accompanied by lower mortality. We also show that, in addition to medical science, the use of a risk science toolbox would have been valuable in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. Better and more widespread understanding of risk perception of the pandemic and the COVID-19 vaccines would have improved managing vaccine hesitancy, potentially leading to more effective pro-vaccination measures."

In this paper, we focus on understanding the risks for severe COVID-19 infections after vaccination (ie, in breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections). Studying these risks by vaccine type, age, sex, comorbidities, and any prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is important to policy makers planning further vaccination efforts. OBJECTIVE: We performed a comparative study of the risks of hospitalization (n=1140) and mortality (n=159) in a SARS-CoV-2 positive cohort of 19,815 patients who were all fully vaccinated with the Pfizer, Moderna, or Janssen vaccines. METHODS: We performed Cox regression analysis to calculate the risk factors for developing a severe breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection in the study cohort by controlling for vaccine type, age, sex, comorbidities, and a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: We found lower hazard ratios for those receiving the Moderna vaccine (P<.001) and Pfizer vaccine (P<.001), with the lowest hazard rates being for Moderna, as compared to those who received the Janssen vaccine, independent of age, sex, comorbidities, vaccine type, and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, individuals who had a SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to vaccination had some increased protection over and above the protection already provided by the vaccines, from hospitalization (P=.001) and death (P=.04), independent of age, sex, comorbidities, and vaccine type. We found that the top statistically significant risk factors for severe breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections were age of >50, male gender, moderate and severe renal failure, severe liver disease, leukemia, chronic lung disease, coagulopathy, and alcohol abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals who were fully vaccinated, the risk of severe breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection was lower for recipients of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines and higher for recipients of the Janssen vaccine. These results from our analysis at a population level will be helpful to public health policy makers. Our result on the influence of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection necessitates further research into the impact of multiple exposures on the risk of developing severe COVID-19."	"2369-2960

The clinical characteristics of 213 post-vaccination CVST cases notified to the European Medicines Agency are reported. METHODS: Data on adverse drug reactions after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination notified until 8 April 2021 under the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Term 'Central nervous system vascular disorders' were obtained from the EudraVigilance database. Post-vaccination CVST was compared with 100 European patients with CVST from before the COVID-19 pandemic derived from the International CVST Consortium. RESULTS: In all, 213 CVST cases were identified: 187 after AstraZeneca/Oxford (ChAdOx1 nCov-19) vaccination and 26 after a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination (25 with Pfizer/BioNTech, BNT162b2, and one with Moderna, mRNA-1273). Thrombocytopenia was reported in 107/187 CVST cases (57%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 50%-64%) in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group, in none in the mRNA vaccine group (0%, 95% CI 0%-13%) and in 7/100 (7%, 95% CI 3%-14%) in the pre-COVID-19 group. In the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group, 39 (21%) reported COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction tests were performed within 30 days of CVST symptom onset, and all were negative. Of the 117 patients with a reported outcome in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group, 44 (38%, 95% CI 29%-47%) had died, compared to 2/10 (20%, 95% CI 6%-51%) in the mRNA vaccine group and 3/100 (3%, 95% CI 1%-8%) in the pre-COVID-19 group. Mortality amongst patients with thrombocytopenia in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group was 49% (95% CI 39%-60%). CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis occurring after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination has a clinical profile distinct from CVST unrelated to vaccination. Only CVST after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination was associated with thrombocytopenia."	"1468-1331

AIM: This study aimed to explore patterns of COVID-19 deaths in Thiruvananthapuram district from 31 March 2020 to 31 December 2021. SETTING AND DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of COVID-19 deaths in Thiruvananthapuram district was performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mortality data were obtained from the district COVID-19 control room, and deaths in the first and second waves of COVID-19 were compared. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We summarised data as proportions and medians with the inter-quartile range (IQR) and performed Chi-square tests to make comparisons wherever applicable. RESULTS: As on 31 December 2021, 4587 COVID-19 deaths were reported in Thiruvananthapuram district, with a case fatality rate of 0.91%. We observed high mortality among older persons (66.7%) and men (56.6%). The leading cause of death was bronchopneumonia (60.6%). The majority (88.5%) had co-morbidities, commonly diabetes mellitus (54.9%). The median interval from diagnosis to hospitalisation was 4 days (IQR 2-7), and that from hospitalisation to death was 2 days (IQR 0-6). The deaths reported during the second wave were four times higher than those of the first wave with a higher proportion of deaths in the absence of co-morbidities (p < 0.001). The majority of the deceased were unvaccinated. Ecological analysis with vaccine coverage data indicated 5.4 times higher mortality among unvaccinated than those who received two vaccine doses. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of co-morbidities, an unvaccinated status, and delay in hospitalisation were important reasons for COVID-19 deaths. Primary level health providers can potentially help sustaining vaccination, expeditious referral, and monitoring of COVID-19 patients."	"2278-7135

It remains largely unknown how AD-related immunosuppressive medications affect the development of vaccine-induced immunity. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine among patients with AD and to assess its effectiveness in protecting against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, COVID-19-associated hospitalization, and mortality. A specific analysis additionally examined whether AD-related immunosuppressive drugs influenced the effectiveness of the vaccine. METHODS: A population-based cohort study was performed using the database of Clalit Heath Services, Israel, to follow adult patients with AD. Multivariate Cox and logistic regression analyses were utilized to calculate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) of the incident outcomes. RESULTS: As of 26 June, 2021, 58,582 (75.4%) out of 77,682 adult patients with AD completed two BNT162b2 vaccine doses in Israel. Adulthood-onset AD (adjusted OR, 1.34; 95% CI 1.28-1.40; p < 0.001) and moderate-to-severe AD (adjusted OR, 1.13; 95% CI 1.05-1.21; p = 0.001) predicted an increased vaccination rate. Vaccinated patients with AD demonstrated a significantly decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted HR, 0.20; 95% CI 0.16-0.26; p < 0.001), COVID-19-associated hospitalization (adjusted HR, 0.08; 95% CI 0.04-0.18; p < 0.001), and COVID-19-associated mortality (adjusted HR, 0.04; 95% CI 0.01-0.20; p < 0.001). Exposure to immunosuppressive drugs (n = 597; 0.8% of patients) did not impair the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination (adjusted HR, 0.95; 95% CI 0.13-6.81; p = 0.958). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AD, COVID-19 vaccination is highly effective for a wide range of COVID-19-related outcomes. Immunosuppressive drugs did not impair the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in this retrospective analysis."	"1179-1888

However, patients with compromised immune status develop a weaker and less stable immune response to vaccination. Strong immune response may not always translate into clinical benefit, therefore it is important to synthesise evidence on modified schemes and types of vaccination in these population subgroups for guiding health decisions. As the literature on COVID-19 vaccines continues to expand, we aimed to scope the literature on multiple subgroups to subsequently decide on the most relevant research questions to be answered by systematic reviews. OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the availability of existing literature on immune response and long-term clinical outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination, and to map this evidence according to the examined populations, specific vaccines, immunity parameters, and their way of determining relevant long-term outcomes and the availability of mapping between immune reactivity and relevant outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, the Web of Science Core Collection, and the World Health Organization COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease on 6 December 2021.  SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies that published results on immunity outcomes after vaccination with BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, AZD1222, Ad26.COV2.S, Sputnik V or Sputnik Light, BBIBP-CorV, or CoronaVac on predefined vulnerable subgroups such as people with malignancies, transplant recipients, people undergoing renal replacement therapy, and people with immune disorders, as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women, and children. We included studies if they had at least 100 participants (not considering healthy control groups); we excluded case studies and case series. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data independently and in duplicate onto an online data extraction form. Data were represented as tables and as online maps to show the frequency of studies for each item. We mapped the data according to study design, country of participant origin, patient comorbidity subgroup, intervention, outcome domains (clinical, safety, immunogenicity), and outcomes.  MAIN RESULTS: Out of 25,452 identified records, 318 studies with a total of more than 5 million participants met our eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Participants were recruited mainly from high-income countries between January 2020 and 31 October 2021 (282/318); the majority of studies included adult participants (297/318).  Haematological malignancies were the most commonly examined comorbidity group (N = 54), followed by solid tumours (N = 47), dialysis (N = 48), kidney transplant (N = 43), and rheumatic diseases (N = 28, 17, and 15 for mixed diseases, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease, respectively). Thirty-one studies included pregnant or breastfeeding women. The most commonly administered vaccine was BNT162b2 (N = 283), followed by mRNA-1273 (N = 153), AZD1222 (N = 66), Ad26.COV2.S (N = 42), BBIBP-CorV (N = 15), CoronaVac (N = 14), and Sputnik V (N = 5; no studies were identified for Sputnik Light). Most studies reported outcomes after regular vaccination scheme.  The majority of studies focused on immunogenicity outcomes, especially seroconversion based on binding antibody measurements and immunoglobulin G (IgG) titres (N = 179 and 175, respectively). Adverse events and serious adverse events were reported in 126 and 54 studies, whilst SARS-CoV-2 infection irrespective of severity was reported in 80 studies. Mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in 36 studies. Please refer to our evidence gap maps for more detailed information. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Up to 6 December 2021, the majority of studies examined data on mRNA vaccines administered as standard vaccination schemes (two doses approximately four to eight weeks apart) that report on immunogenicity parameters or adverse events. Clinical outcomes were less commonly reported, and if so, were often reported as a secondary outcome observed in seroconversion or immunoglobulin titre studies. As informed by this scoping review, two effectiveness reviews (on haematological malignancies and kidney transplant recipients) are currently being conducted."	"1469-493x

Both vaccines produce the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for gain of immunity and have greatly reduced mortality and morbidity from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The distribution and duration of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine persistence in human tissues is unclear. Here, we developed specific RT-qPCR-based assays to detect each mRNA vaccine and screened lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and myocardium from recently vaccinated deceased patients. Vaccine was detected in the axillary lymph nodes in the majority of patients dying within 30 days of vaccination, but not in patients dying more than 30 days from vaccination. Vaccine was not detected in the mediastinal lymph nodes, spleen, or liver. Vaccine was detected in the myocardium in a subset of patients vaccinated within 30 days of death. Cardiac ventricles in which vaccine was detected had healing myocardial injury at the time of vaccination and had more myocardial macrophages than the cardiac ventricles in which vaccine was not detected. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines routinely persist up to 30 days from vaccination and can be detected in the heart."	"2059-0105

Effective vaccines to prevent COVID-19 are urgently needed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our objective was to assess the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines through analyses of all currently available randomized clinical trials. We searched the databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and other sources from inception to June 17, 2021 for randomized clinical trials assessing vaccines for COVID-19. At least two independent reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We conducted meta-analyses, network meta-analyses, and Trial Sequential Analyses (TSA). Our primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, vaccine efficacy, and serious adverse events. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE. We identified 46 trials; 35 trials randomizing 219 864 participants could be included in our analyses. Our meta-analyses showed that mRNA vaccines (efficacy, 95% [95% confidence interval (CI), 92% to 97%]; 71 514 participants; 3 trials; moderate certainty); inactivated vaccines (efficacy, 61% [95% CI, 52% to 68%]; 48 029 participants; 3 trials; moderate certainty); protein subunit vaccines (efficacy, 77% [95% CI, -5% to 95%]; 17 737 participants; 2 trials; low certainty); and viral vector vaccines (efficacy 68% [95% CI, 61% to 74%]; 71 401 participants; 5 trials; low certainty) prevented COVID-19. Viral vector vaccines decreased mortality (risk ratio, 0.25 [95% CI 0.09 to 0.67]; 67 563 participants; 3 trials, low certainty), but comparable data on inactivated, mRNA, and protein subunit vaccines were imprecise. None of the vaccines showed evidence of a difference on serious adverse events, but observational evidence suggested rare serious adverse events. All the vaccines increased the risk of non-serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence suggests that all the included vaccines are effective in preventing COVID-19. The mRNA vaccines seem most effective in preventing COVID-19, but viral vector vaccines seem most effective in reducing mortality. Further trials and longer follow-up are necessary to provide better insight into the safety profile of these vaccines."	"1932-6203

This study analyses the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on geriatric hip fracture outcomes. We hypothesise that having the COVID-19 vaccine improves outcomes for geriatric patients treated for hip fracture. METHODS: Between December 2020 and January 2022, 506 patients treated for hip fracture were analysed for demographics, hospital quality measures, and outcomes. Patients were grouped according to vaccine series administration status. During the study period, there were 329 (65%) unvaccinated patients (NV), 14 (3%) partially vaccinated (PV) patients, 138 (27%) fully vaccinated (FV) patients, and 25 (5%) patients received a booster shot (BV). Variables were compared using chi square, independent sample t-tests or ANOVA as appropriate. Multivariable logistic regression was used to independently assess the impact of vaccination. RESULTS: The rate of minor complications decreased if any vaccination status was achieved (NV: 37.99%, PV: 21.34%, FV: 28.26%, BV: 20.00%; p = 0.054). Vaccinated patients had a decreased need for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) level care (NV: 14.89%, PV: 7.14%, FV: 5.80%, BV: 8.00%; p = 0.038). There were no differences in inpatient or 30-day mortality, major complications, length of stay, home discharge, or readmission within 30 or 90 days. Vaccination against COVID-19 was independently protective against the need for ICU level care. Additionally, female gender and vaccination against COVID-19 decreased the rate of minor complications. Older age and higher comorbidity burden increased the rate of minor complications. DISCUSSION: In the hip fracture population, vaccination against COVID-19 was protective against the need for ICU level care and decreased overall minor complications. Larger studies are needed to determine if vaccination decreases mortality in this population. These findings have resource allocation implications including ICU bed availability during pandemics and patient outreach to improve vaccination status."	"1724-6067

Chronic kidney disease"	"INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have increased vulnerability to infections including Covid-19. There is limited availability of antiviral in CKD patients. All guidelines have prioritized vaccinations for CKD patients. The variability in immunogenic response is multifactorial in CKD group. We have tried to analyze the outcome of Covid-19 infection and the impact of COVID-19 vaccination [COVAXIN / COVISHIELD] in our cohort. MATERIALS METHODS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: In a retrospective observational study, 73 cases of Covid-19 positive CKD patients were selected, who were managed as per MOFHW guidelines. The data of first laboratory values and radiological findings were evaluated. Their treatment outcome and stay during hospitalization were studied. All data were later analyzed using STATA 16.1 software. RESULTS: In this study, 73 cases of CKD with Covid-19 were included. There were 38 patients who were vaccinated with at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, while there were 35 patients who were unvaccinated. Out of 38 patients, 20 were vaccinated with 2 doses of Covid-19 while 18 received only one dose. The unvaccinated group was having more hypoxia and raised inflammatory markers, and had more lung involvement [i.e. higher CT severity value] [p value for CTSS-0.0765]. There was a higher mortality rate observed in the unvaccinated group [i.e-65.71%] than the vaccinated group [39.47%] [p-value 0.0249]. Dialysis was needed in 57.50% of the study population either due to failure of conservative management for renal failure or due to maintenance dialysis. The mean duration of hospitalization was 11.47 days with a mortality rate of 52% which is much higher than the reported average data in CKD patients. CONCLUSION: Vaccination seems to be very helpful in combating the adverse effect of Covid-19 in CKD patients. It also reduces mortality significantly in Covid-19 infected CKD patients."	"0975-5764

We aimed to assess the value of a hypothetical vaccine and its potential public health impact when prioritization is required due to supply constraints. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was used to estimate COVID-19 related direct medical costs and deaths in the United States (US), with and without implementation of a 60% efficacious vaccine. To prioritize the vaccine under constrained supply, the population was divided into tiers based on age; risk and age; and occupation and age; and outcomes were compared across one year under various supply assumptions. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained versus no vaccine was calculated for the entire adult population and for each tier in the three prioritization schemes. RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained for the US adult population was $8,200 versus no vaccination. For the tiers at highest risk of complications from COVID-19, such as those ages 65 years and older, vaccination was cost-saving compared to no vaccination. The cost per QALY gained increased to over $94,000 for those with a low risk of hospitalization and death following infection. Results were most sensitive to infection incidence, vaccine price, the cost of treating COVID-19, and vaccine efficacy. Under the most optimistic supply scenario, the hypothetical vaccine may prevent 31% of expected deaths. As supply becomes more constrained, only 23% of deaths may be prevented. In lower supply scenarios, prioritization becomes more important to maximize the number of deaths prevented. CONCLUSIONS: A COVID-19 vaccine is predicted to be good value for money (cost per QALY gained <$50,000). The speed at which an effective vaccine can be made available will determine how much morbidity and mortality may be prevented in the US."	"1873-2518

METHODS: A total of 149 patients with COVID-19-positive admitted from March 20 to May 10, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. RESULTS: Ninety-eight (65.8%) patients received at least a single annual flu shot in the last year, and fifty-one (34.2%) were never vaccinated. On presentation, vaccinated patients were more likely to present with gastrointestinal symptoms (P < .05). There were no significant differences between study groups in laboratory findings or clinical outcomes. In multivariate analysis, receiving the annual shot did not influence risk of intensive care unit admission (OR = 1.17, 95%CI = 0.50-2.72, P = .72), intubation (OR = 1.40, 95%CI = 0.60-3.23, P = .43), complications (OR = 1.08, 95%CI = 0.52-2.26, P = .83) or mortality (OR = 1.29, 95%CI = 0.31-5.29, P = .73). CONCLUSION: Although the benefits of the influenza vaccine for preventing disease and reducing morbidity in influenza patients are well established, no differences in outcomes for hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who received their annual influenza vaccination versus the non-vaccinated cohort were evident. There is a need for future meta-analyses, including randomised controlled studies in which the number of cases is increased to validate these findings."	"1742-1241

Booster vaccines were offered with one or two doses for the vulnerable population during these periods. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The nationwide HUN-VE 2 study examined the effectiveness of primary immunization, single booster, and double booster vaccination in the prevention of Covid-19 related mortality during the Delta and Omicron waves, compared to an unvaccinated control population without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection during the same study periods. The risk of Covid-19 related death was 55% lower during the Omicron vs. Delta wave in the whole study population (n=9,569,648 and n=9,581,927, respectively; rate ratio [RR]: 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44-0.48). During the Delta wave, the risk of Covid-19 related death was 74% lower in the primary immunized population (RR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.25-0.28) and 96% lower in the booster immunized population (RR: 0.04; 95% CI: 0.04-0.05), vs. the unvaccinated control group. During the Omicron wave, the risk of Covid-19 related death was 40% lower in the primary immunized population (RR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.55-0.65) and 82% lower in the booster immunized population (RR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.16-0.2) vs. the unvaccinated control group. The double booster immunized population had a 93% lower risk of Covid-19 related death compared to those with only one booster dose (RR: 0.07; 95% CI. 0.01-0.46). The benefit of the second booster was slightly more pronounced in older age groups. CONCLUSIONS: The HUN-VE 2 study demonstrated the significantly lower risk of Covid-19 related mortality associated with the Omicron vs. Delta variant and confirmed the benefit of single and double booster vaccination against Covid-19 related death. Furthermore, the results showed the additional benefit of a second booster dose in terms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19 related mortality."	"1664-3224

We estimate trends in mortality by month of admission and vaccination status among those hospitalised with COVID-19 in England between March 2020 to September 2021, controlling for demographic factors and hospital load. Among 259,727 hospitalised COVID-19 cases, 51,948 (20.0%) experienced mortality in hospital. Hospitalised fatality risk ranged from 40.3% (95% confidence interval 39.4-41.3%) in March 2020 to 8.1% (7.2-9.0%) in June 2021. Older individuals and those with multiple co-morbidities were more likely to die or else experienced longer stays prior to discharge. Compared to unvaccinated people, the hazard of hospitalised mortality was 0.71 (0.67-0.77) with a first vaccine dose, and 0.56 (0.52-0.61) with a second vaccine dose. Compared to hospital load at 0-20% of the busiest week, the hazard of hospitalised mortality during periods of peak load (90-100%), was 1.23 (1.12-1.34). The prognosis for people hospitalised with COVID-19 in England has varied substantially throughout the pandemic and according to case-mix, vaccination, and hospital load. Our estimates provide an indication for demands on hospital resources, and the relationship between hospital burden and outcomes."	"2041-1723

METHODS: A total of 1260 dialysis patients with confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 infection was included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups: patients who experienced breakthrough infection and those who were unvaccinated. The need of oxygen supplementation and mortality risks were compared using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The mortality rate was 24.2% in unvaccinated patients and 8.6% in breakthrough patients. The odds ratio of need of oxygen supplementation in the breakthrough patients relative to unvaccinated patients was 0.197. The hazard ratio of mortality in the breakthrough patients relative to unvaccinated patients was 0.464. CONCLUSION: Our prospective observational study showed that SRAS-CoV-2 vaccination in hemodialysis patients is vital for reducing need of oxygen supplementation and mortality risk."	"1744-9987

Mass vaccination programs were regarded as the sole solution to end the pandemic. Here, we compare the differential impact of mass vaccination programs in Saudi Arabia (SA) and the United Kingdom (UK) on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality to determine whether vaccines were solely responsible for the changes observed in the disease dynamics. Methodology We retrospectively collected the number of new cases and deaths throughout 2021 in both SA and the UK. Similarly, the number of vaccine doses delivered in both countries was collected and compared. Results Through 2021, the percentage of daily COVID-19 cases was significantly less in SA than in the UK; however, the percentage of deaths was higher in SA. Interestingly, the percentage of daily cases was significantly reduced in SA upon vaccination. The vaccination coverage of both the first and second doses was higher in the UK compared to SA, and, consequently, the percentage of deaths was significantly reduced in the UK compared to SA. Conclusions The UK vaccination program succeeded in curbing the number of daily deaths compared to SA. SA had better control over the percentage of daily cases, primarily due to the restrictive measures and vaccination, such as the imposed social distancing and mandatory face masks."	"2168-8184

METHODS: We established a national registry of AIIRD patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including demographic data, AIIRD diagnosis, duration and systemic involvement, comorbidities, date of COVID-19 diagnosis, clinical course, and dates of vaccinations. COVID-19 was diagnosed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Israel experienced 4 outbreaks of COVID-19 until 30.11.2021. The first three outbreaks (1.3.2020 - 30.4.2021) comprised 298 AIIRD patients. 64.9% had a mild disease and 24.2% had a severe course; 161 (53.3%) patients were hospitalized, 27 (8.9%) died. The 4(th) outbreak (delta variant), starting 6 months after the beginning of the vaccination campaign comprised 110 patients. Despite similar demographic and clinical characteristics, a smaller proportion of AIIRD patients had negative outcomes as compared to the first 3 outbreaks, with regards to severity (16 patients,14.5%), hospitalization (29 patients, 26.4%) and death (7 patients, 6.4%). COVID-19 did not seem to influence the AIIRD activity 1-3 months post-recovery. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is more severe and has an increased mortality in active AIIRD patients with systemic involvement, older age and comorbidities. Vaccination with 3 doses of the mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 protected from severe COVID-19, hospitalization and death during the 4(th) outbreak. The pattern of spread of COVID-19 in AIIRD patients was similar to the general population."	"1664-3224

The objective of the current study is to investigate the association between the severity of COVID-19 with prior BCG vaccination in adult patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients (18 years or above) with positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction admitted in July 2020 were included in this cross-sectional study. Patients were classified into non-severe, severe, and critical diseases. History of prior BCG vaccination and the presence of a BCG vaccination scar were recorded. RESULTS: Out of 103 patients, 64 patients with prior history of BCG vaccinations were compared with 39 patients without BCG vaccination in childhood. The median age was 55 years and 64 years in BCG vaccinated & non-BCG vaccinated patients (p-value=0.002). There was male predominance in both groups and frequent comorbid illnesses were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Severe COVID-19 was found in 91 patients (88.3%) followed by non-severe disease and critical diseases i.e., 7 (6.8%) and 5 (4.9%) patients, respectively. No association of prior BCG vaccination with disease severity of COVID-19 was found in this study and mortality was 8.7%. Out of nine patients who expired only 2 (22.2%) had a prior history of BCG vaccination (p-value=0.01). Secondary infections were present in 26 patients and the majority had pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The BCG vaccine has no impact on the severity of COVID-19 but could have a protective role with a low mortality rate in already infected patients."	"2287-366x

To date, only a limited number of vaccines have been given emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. There is a need to systematically review the existing vaccine candidates and investigate their safety, efficacy, immunogenicity, unwanted events, and limitations. The review was undertaken by searching online databases, i.e., Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect, with finally 59 studies selected. Our findings showed several types of vaccine candidates with different strategies against SARS-CoV-2, including inactivated, mRNA-based, recombinant, and nanoparticle-based vaccines, are being developed and launched. We have compared these vaccines in terms of their efficacy, side effects, and seroconversion based on data reported in the literature. We found mRNA vaccines appeared to have better efficacy, and inactivated ones had fewer side effects and similar seroconversion in all types of vaccines. Overall, global variant surveillance and systematic tweaking of vaccines, coupled with the evaluation and administering vaccines with the same or different technology in successive doses along with homologous and heterologous prime-booster strategy, have become essential to impede the pandemic. Their effectiveness appreciably outweighs any concerns with any adverse events."	"2076-393x

The vaccination drive to immunize the people of Pakistan against Covid-19 was also going on during this period. There were multiple types of vaccines being administered to the people of Pakistan, as the vaccines had been procured from multiple sources. Some people had apprehensions about different vaccines being administered in the country. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics and outcome of the patients vaccinated against Covid-19 with those of the non-vaccinated patients during the fourth wave of Covid-19 in Pakistan Naval Ship (PNS) Shifa Hospital. Methods The cross-sectional descriptive study was performed at PNS Shifa Hospital Karachi, from July to October 2021. All the Covid-19 patients treated in PNS Shifa Hospital during the "fourth Covid-19 wave" were interviewed. Their medical records were accessed, and they were followed up till their discharge from the hospital. The vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients were compared for differences in their age or gender distribution, the severity of illness, comorbidities, and mortality. Results There were 884 participants in the study: 664 (75.11%) men and 220 (24.89%) women. There were 493 patients below 40 years of age, 233 were 40-59 years old, and 158 were aged 60 and above. One hundred and sixty-nine patients had one or more comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, various malignancies, bronchial asthma, and chronic kidney disease. There were 63 (7.13%) obese patients, 28 of whom developed severe disease. Five hundred and four (57%) patients were vaccinated and 380 (47%) were non-vaccinated. Among the vaccinated patients, the effect of Covid-19 was mild in 58.37%, moderate in 36.11%, severe in 0.79%, and critical in 4.37%. Among the non-vaccinated patients, the effect of Covid-19 was mild in 40.26%, moderate in 46.58%, severe in 3.16%, and critical in 10%. The difference in disease severity between the two groups was statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusion Vaccinated Covid-19 patients had significantly lower severity of disease and displayed better outcomes when compared to non-vaccinated patients during the fourth Covid-19 wave dominated by the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus."

In this report, we aimed to describe fatal and non-fatal possible AEs after COVID-19 vaccine administration. METHODS: An observational multicenter study investigating the causes of emergency department visits and hospital admissions within 10 days of COVID-19 vaccination. Patients who received first or second doses of COVID-19 vaccines and presented to the emergency department (ED), as well as those admitted to the hospitals or intensive care units (ICUs) were included. Causes of ED, hospital, and ICU admissions and discharges were collected based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding system. RESULTS: Between December 2020 and March 2021, 1842 patients visited the ED within 10 days of COVID-19 vaccine administration. The mean age was 70.3 years. Overall, 1221 patients presented after the first dose of the vaccine and 653 after the second dose. Trauma (14.9%), hypertensive emergency/urgency (7.8%), generalized pain and arthralgia (5.7%), and chest pain (4.4%) were the most common causes of presentation to the ED. Of all ED presentations, mortality rate was at 2.2% (41 patients) with a median follow-up time of 68.0 days, versus 2.6% in unvaccinated ED patients. Postvaccination acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (46.3%), septic shock (24.4%), and cardiogenic shock (12.2%) were the most common causes of death. CONCLUSION: Although reported AEs are not necessarily caused by the vaccination, this study provides further information about possible AEs after COVID-19 immunization, especially those requiring hospital admission. This study also supports prior data that serious AEs post vaccination are much lower than primary COVID-19 infections. Further studies are needed to investigate causalities between vaccines and reported AEs across all age groups."	"2688-1152

Large datasets are required to precisely estimate the association between Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination and CVST due to the extreme rarity of this event. We aimed to accomplish this by combining national data from England, Scotland, and Wales. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We created data platforms consisting of linked primary care, secondary care, mortality, and virological testing data in each of England, Scotland, and Wales, with a combined cohort of 11,637,157 people and 6,808,293 person years of follow-up. The cohort start date was December 8, 2020, and the end date was June 30, 2021. The outcome measure we examined was incident CVST events recorded in either primary or secondary care records. We carried out a self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis of this outcome following first dose vaccination with ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2. The observation period consisted of an initial 90-day reference period, followed by a 2-week prerisk period directly prior to vaccination, and a 4-week risk period following vaccination. Counts of CVST cases from each country were tallied, then expanded into a full dataset with 1 row for each individual and observation time period. There was a combined total of 201 incident CVST events in the cohorts (29.5 per million person years). There were 81 CVST events in the observation period among those who a received first dose of ChAdOx1 (approximately 16.34 per million doses) and 40 for those who received a first dose of BNT162b2 (approximately 12.60 per million doses). We fitted conditional Poisson models to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs). Vaccination with ChAdOx1 was associated with an elevated risk of incident CVST events in the 28 days following vaccination, IRR = 1.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20 to 3.11). We did not find an association between BNT162b2 and CVST in the 28 days following vaccination, IRR = 0.78 (95% CI 0.34 to 1.77). Our study had some limitations. The SCCS study design implicitly controls for variables that are constant over the observation period, but also assumes that outcome events are independent of exposure. This assumption may not be satisfied in the case of CVST, firstly because it is a serious adverse event, and secondly because the vaccination programme in the United Kingdom prioritised the clinically extremely vulnerable and those with underlying health conditions, which may have caused a selection effect for individuals more prone to CVST. Although we pooled data from several large datasets, there was still a low number of events, which may have caused imprecision in our estimates. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed a small elevated risk of CVST events following vaccination with ChAdOx1, but not BNT162b2. Our analysis pooled information from large datasets from England, Scotland, and Wales. This evidence may be useful in risk-benefit analyses of vaccine policies and in providing quantification of risks associated with vaccination to the general public."	"1549-1676

Such real-world data on ChAdOx1 nCoV-19- and BBV152-vaccinated individuals are scarce. Hence, there is an urgent need to understand their clinical profile and outcomes. METHODS: A 1:1 pair-matched study was performed among vaccinated and unvaccinated COVID-19 patients admitted between March 2021 and June 2021 at a tertiary care centre in New Delhi, India. The vaccinated group (received at least one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BBV152) was prospectively followed till discharge or death and matched [for age (±10 years), sex, baseline disease severity and comorbidities] with a retrospective group of unvaccinated patients admitted during the study period. Paired analysis was done to look for clinical outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS: The study included a total of 210 patients, with 105 in each of the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. In the vaccinated group, 47 (44.8%) and 58 (55.2%) patients had received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BBV152, respectively. However, 73 patients had received one dose and 32 had received two doses of the vaccine. Disease severity was mild in 36.2%, moderate in 31.4% and severe in 32.4%. Two mortalities were reported out of 19 fully vaccinated individuals. All-cause mortality in the vaccinated group was 8.6% (9/105), which was significantly lower than the matched unvaccinated group mortality of 21.9% (23/105), p = 0.007. Vaccination increased the chances of survival (OR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.42-10.18) compared to the unvaccinated group. CONCLUSION: In the second wave of the pandemic predominated by delta variant of SARS CoV-2, vaccination reduced all-cause mortality among hospitalized patients, although the results are only preliminary."

The present study estimates the recovery and mortality rates among in-house COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care center and also determines any association between mortality and variables of interest. METHODS AND MATERIAL: This cross-sectional study was conducted in June to December 2021 among the COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital based on their case sheets. A sample size of 1500 was calculated which was obtained by simple random sampling. Descriptive statistics were generated. Association between mortality and other variables was tested by using bivariate logistic regression and multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The overall recovery rate was 80.1%. Vaccination status was significantly associated with mortality, with the AOR (95% CI) of getting both vaccine doses and a single dose being 0.18 (0.05-0.70) and 0.28 (0.15-0.55), respectively, when compared to the unvaccinated group. Also, patients who sought admission on their own were found to be having more chances of recovery compared to those who were referred from other health facilities. The risk of dying was found to be increased nearly 5-fold among those who used Non-Rebreathing machines. The use of Non-Invasive ventilation and Bain Circuit was significantly associated with a bad prognosis. None on the mechanical ventilation survived. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients admitted to the tertiary care hospital was found to be one-fifth and the ICU-specific mortality rate was 83.6% while other factors like age and gender were not found to be associated with mortality. Among comorbidities, only liver diseases were found to be a significant determinant of mortality. Finally, patients who needed more flow rate of oxygen had a significant association with mortality."

However, the direct and indirect impacts of the program at the population level have yet to be fully evaluated. To assess the vaccine effectiveness during the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) epidemic in 2021, we used a renewal process model. A transmission model was fitted to the confirmed cases from 17 February to 30 November 2021. In the absence of vaccination, the cumulative numbers of infections and deaths during the study period were estimated to be 63.3 million (95% confidence interval [CI] 63.2-63.6) and 364,000 (95% CI 363-366), respectively; the actual numbers of infections and deaths were 4.7 million and 10,000, respectively. Were the vaccination implemented 14 days earlier, there could have been 54% and 48% fewer cases and deaths, respectively, than the actual numbers. We demonstrated the very high effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in Japan during 2021, which reduced mortality by more than 97% compared with the counterfactual scenario. The timing of expanding vaccination and vaccine recipients could be key to mitigating the disease burden of COVID-19. Rapid and proper decision making based on firm epidemiological input is vital."

Vaccination"	"BACKGROUND: A single dose strategy may be adequate to confer population level immunity and protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, especially in low- and middle-income countries where vaccine supply remains limited. We compared the effectiveness of a single dose strategy of the Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection across all age groups and over an extended follow-up period. METHODS: Individuals vaccinated in North-West London, UK, with either the first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines between January 12, 2021 and March 09, 2021, were matched to each other by demographic and clinical characteristics. Each vaccinated individual was additionally matched to an unvaccinated control. Study outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity, COVID-19 hospitalisation, COVID-19 death, and all-cause mortality. FINDINGS: Amongst matched individuals, 63,608 were in each of the vaccine groups and 127,216 were unvaccinated. Between 14 and 84 days of follow-up after matching, there were 534 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 65 COVID-19 hospitalisations, and 190 deaths, of which 29 were categorized as due to COVID-19. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) for SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 1.05) for Oxford-Astra-Zeneca, and 0.69 (0.55 to 0.86) for Pfizer-BioNTech. The IRR for both vaccines was the same at 0.25 (0.09 to 0.55) and 0.14 (0.02 to 0.58) for reducing COVID-19 hospitalization and COVID-19 mortality, respectively. The IRR for all-cause mortality was 0.25 (0.15 to 0.39) and 0.18 (0.10 to 0.30) for the Oxford-Astra-Zeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, respectively. Age was an effect modifier of the association between vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity; lower hazard ratios for increasing age. INTERPRETATION: A single dose strategy, for both vaccines, was effective at reducing COVID-19 mortality and hospitalization rates. The magnitude of vaccine effectiveness was comparatively lower for SARS-CoV-2 infection, although this was variable across the age range, with higher effectiveness seen with older adults. Our results have important implications for health system planning -especially in low resource settings where vaccine supply remains constrained."	"2589-5370

*Vaccine Efficacy"	"BACKGROUND: Reports suggest that COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness is decreasing, but whether this reflects waning or new SARS-CoV-2 variants-especially delta (B.1.617.2)-is unclear. We investigated the association between time since two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in Scotland (where delta was dominant), with comparative analyses in Brazil (where delta was uncommon). METHODS: In this retrospective, population-based cohort study in Brazil and Scotland, we linked national databases from the EAVE II study in Scotland; and the COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign, Acute Respiratory Infection Suspected Cases, and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection/Illness datasets in Brazil) for vaccination, laboratory testing, clinical, and mortality data. We defined cohorts of adults (aged ≥18 years) who received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and compared rates of severe COVID-19 outcomes (ie, COVID-19 hospital admission or death) across fortnightly periods, relative to 2-3 weeks after the second dose. Entry to the Scotland cohort started from May 19, 2021, and entry to the Brazil cohort started from Jan 18, 2021. Follow-up in both cohorts was until Oct 25, 2021. Poisson regression was used to estimate rate ratios (RRs) and vaccine effectiveness, with 95% CIs. FINDINGS: 1 972 454 adults received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in Scotland and 42 558 839 in Brazil, with longer follow-up in Scotland because two-dose vaccination began earlier in Scotland than in Brazil. In Scotland, RRs for severe COVID-19 increased to 2·01 (95% CI 1·54-2·62) at 10-11 weeks, 3·01 (2·26-3·99) at 14-15 weeks, and 5·43 (4·00-7·38) at 18-19 weeks after the second dose. The pattern of results was similar in Brazil, with RRs of 2·29 (2·01-2·61) at 10-11 weeks, 3·10 (2·63-3·64) at 14-15 weeks, and 4·71 (3·83-5·78) at 18-19 weeks after the second dose. In Scotland, vaccine effectiveness decreased from 83·7% (95% CI 79·7-87·0) at 2-3 weeks, to 75·9% (72·9-78·6) at 14-15 weeks, and 63·7% (59·6-67·4) at 18-19 weeks after the second dose. In Brazil, vaccine effectiveness decreased from 86·4% (85·4-87·3) at 2-3 weeks, to 59·7% (54·6-64·2) at 14-15 weeks, and 42·2% (32·4-50·6) at 18-19 weeks. INTERPRETATION: We found waning vaccine protection of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against COVID-19 hospital admissions and deaths in both Scotland and Brazil, this becoming evident within three months of the second vaccine dose. Consideration needs to be given to providing booster vaccine doses for people who have received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.

Fully vaccinated"	"BACKGROUND: The B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first discovered in Maharashtra in late 2020 and has rapidly expanded across India and worldwide. It took only 2 mo for this variant to spread in Indonesia, making the country the new epicenter of the delta variant as of July 2021. Despite efforts made by accelerating massive rollouts of current vaccines to protect against infection, cases of fully-vaccinated people infected with the delta variant have been reported. AIM: To describe the demographic statistics and clinical presentation of the delta variant infection after the second dose of vaccine in Indonesia. METHODS: A retrospective, single-centre case series of the general consecutive population that worked or studied at Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia with confirmed Delta Variant Infection after a second dose of vaccine from 24 June and 25 June 2021. Cases were collected retrospectively based on a combination of author recall, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and whole genome sequencing results from the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia. RESULTS: Between 24 June and 25 June 2021, 15 subjects were confirmed with the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant infection after a second dose of the vaccine. Fourteen subjects were vaccinated with CoronaVac (Sinovac) and one subject with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca). All of the subjects remained in home isolation, with fever being the most common symptom at the onset of illness (n = 10, 66.67%). The mean duration of symptoms was 7.73 d (± 5.444). The mean time that elapsed from the first positive swab to a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was 17.93 d (± 6.3464). The median time that elapsed from the second dose of vaccine to the first positive swab was 87 d (interquartile range: 86-128). CONCLUSION: Although this case shows that after two doses of vaccine, subjects are still susceptible to the delta variant infection, currently available vaccines remain the most effective protection. They reduce clinical manifestations of COVID-19, decrease recovery time from the first positive swab to negative swab, and lower the probability of hospitalization and mortality rate compared to unvaccinated individuals."

We estimated excess mortality in 2020 to 2021 for critical occupations in different racial groups and vaccine rollout phases using death certificates and occupational employment rates for 2017 to 2021. Results. Excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic was higher for workers in critical occupations than for noncritical workers. Some critical occupations, such as transportation and logistics, construction, and food service, experienced higher excess mortality than did other critical occupations, such as health care, K-12 school staff, and agriculture. In almost all occupations investigated, workers of color experienced higher excess mortality than did White workers. Excess mortality in 2021 was greater than in 2020 across groups: occupations, vaccine eligibility tiers, and race/ethnicity. Conclusions. Although workers in critical occupations experienced greater excess mortality than did others, excess mortality among critical workers varied substantially by occupation and race. Public Health Implications. Analysis of mortality across occupations can be used to identify vulnerable populations, prioritize protective interventions for them, and develop targeted worker safety protocols to promote equitable health outcomes.

Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is a leading strategy to change the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. AIMS OF THE STUDY: Our aim was to investigate the efficacy and side effects of the Sinopharm vaccine in patients with hemoglobinopathies in Iran and the frequency of breakthrough infection after a full course of vaccination. METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional study of 434 patients with hemoglobinopathies (303 β-thalassemia major, 118 β-thalassemia intermedia, and 13 sickle-thalassemia) were conducted from March to July 2021 in IRAN. All patients have received the first dose of the China Sinopharm vaccine and received the second dose of the vaccine 28 days apar. ANTIBODY TESTING: Detection of immunity after vaccination was evaluated by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Pishtazteb ELISA commercial kit), including a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT), for detection of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG), total neutralizing antibody (NAb). RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 35.0 ± 8.5 (from 18 to 70) years, and 55.6% were positive for the antibody. Overall, 48.2% of the studied population had at least one side effect after vaccination. The most frequent side effects were fever and chills, dizziness, and body pain. A total of 90 (20.7%) vaccinated patients developed breakthrough infections after two doses of Sinopharm vaccination. Disease severity was recorded, and it was classified as mild in 77.8%, moderate in 13.6%, and severe in 7.4% of patients. One 28-year-old woman with β-thalassemia major died eight days after diagnosing a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: No safety concerns were identified in patients who received two doses of the Sinopharm vaccine. Its efficacy was not optimal due to the lack of effect on new variations of the virus. However, our data show that it seems to be protective against the severity of COVID-19 infection in patients with hemoglobinopathies. The frequency of breakthrough infections after two doses of Sinopharm vaccination supports the evolving dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 variants requiring special challenge since such infection may represent a risk for vulnerable patients."

The model was calibrated to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality between October 2020 and April 2021 (aggressive pandemic phase), and projected an extended outlook to estimate mortality during a less aggressive phase (April-August 2021). Simulated scenarios evaluated mAbs for averting infections and deaths in addition to vaccines and aggregated non-pharmaceutical interventions. Scenarios included mAbs as a treatment of COVID-19 and for passive immunity for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) during a period when variants were susceptible to the mAbs. Rapid diagnostic testing paired with mAbs was evaluated as an early treatment-as-prevention strategy. Sensitivity analyses included increasing mAb supply and vaccine rollout. Allocation of mAbs for use only as PEP averted up to 14% more infections than vaccine alone, and targeting individuals ≥ 65 years averted up to 37% more deaths. Rapid testing for earlier diagnosis and mAb use amplified these benefits. Doubling the mAb supply further reduced infections and mortality. mAbs provided benefits even as proportion of the immunized population increased. Model projections estimated that ~ 42% of expected deaths between April and August 2021 could be averted. Assuming sensitivity to mAbs, their use as early treatment and PEP in addition to vaccines would substantially reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and mortality even as vaccination increases and mortality decreases. These results provide a template for informing public health policy for future pandemic preparedness."	"1532-6535

The aim of the present study was to assess the incidence of COVID-19 hospitalizations after vaccination, as well as the effect of prior vaccination on hospitalization outcomes among patients with COVID-19. We analyzed and compared all consecutive patients, with or without prior vaccination, who were admitted to our hospital network due to COVID-19 from January to April 2021. Our primary outcome was to identify and describe cases of COVID-19 hospitalized after vaccination. We also utilized a multivariate logistic regression model to investigate the association of previous vaccination with hospitalization outcomes. We identified 915 consecutive patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 with 91/915 (10%) previously vaccinated with at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Utilizing our multivariate logistic regression model, we found that prior vaccination, regardless of the number of doses or days since vaccination, was associated with decreased mortality (aOR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.98) when compared to unvaccinated individuals. Our study showed that COVID-19 related hospitalization after vaccination may occur to a small percentage of patients, mainly those who are partially vaccinated. However, our findings underline that prior vaccination, even when partial, is associated with a decreased risk of death. Ongoing vaccination efforts should remain an absolute priority."	"2414-6366

In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the relationship between vaccination and retrospective evaluation of 32 patients who underwent a heart transplant in the clinic and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction. METHODS: In this study, demographic characteristics of the cases, comorbidities, timing of heart transplantation, immunosuppressive treatments, symptoms of COVID-19 infection, lung imaging findings, follow-up (outpatient/inpatient), treatments, 1-month mortality, and vaccination histories against COVID-19 infection were evaluated. The data obtained from the study were analyzed with SPSS version 25.0. RESULTS: The 3 most common symptoms are cough (37.5%), myalgia (28.1%), and fever (21.8%). COVID-19 infection was severe in 6.2% of the patients, moderate in 37.5%, and mild in 56.2%. Hospitalization was required in 5 patients (15.6%, 1 in the intensive care unit), and the other patients were followed up as an outpatient. Severe COVID-19 infection was seen more in 33% of unvaccinated patients; 93.5% were vaccinated. Nineteen patients (68%) were vaccinated before COVID-19 infection. Our patients received the CoronoVac (Sinovac, China) vaccine. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection is more likely to be severe and mortal in patients with heart transplant recipients. It is also crucial to comply with preventive measures other than immunization in this group of patients. This study is the largest series investigating COVID-19 infection in heart transplant recipient patients in our country."	"1873-2623

Vaccine effectiveness"	"BACKGROUND: As of September 2022, nearly 1.3 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine products have been administered in Latin America and the Caribbean, where 27% of global COVID-19 deaths have occurred. This study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against lab-confirmed COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths among adults in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia. METHODS: Using a test-negative case control design, we evaluated the effectiveness of a primary vaccination series considering six COVID-19 vaccine products (Sputnik V, mRNA-1273, CoronaVac, ChAdOx1, BNT162b2, Ad26.COV2.S) against lab-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths among 83,708 hospitalized adults from February-December, 2021. Data from hospitalization records, COVID surveillance, and vaccination registries were used. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated using logistic regression ((1-OR) x 100). FINDINGS: The average age of participants was 56.7 (SD = 17.5), and 45,894 (54.8%) were male. Adjusted VE (aVE) estimates for full vaccination against hospitalization were 82% for mRNA-1273 (95% confidence interval (CI) = -30 to 98%), 76% (71%-81%) for BNT162b2, 65% (61-68%) for ChAdOx1, 57% (10-79%) for Sputnik V, 53% (50-56%) for CoronaVac, and 46% (23-62%) for Ad26.COV2.S. Estimates, particularly for CoronaVac, varied by variant. Decreasing aVE was estimated as age increased, particularly for CoronaVac and ChAdOx1. aVE estimates against death were generally higher, with 100% (CI not estimated) for mRNA-1273, 82% (69-90%) for BNT162b2, 73% (69-77%) for ChAdOx1, 65% (60-67%) for CoronaVac, 38% (-75 to 78%) for Sputnik V, 6% (-58 to 44%) for Ad26.COV2.S. INTERPRETATION: Primary series vaccination with available COVID-19 vaccine products was effective against COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality. Effectiveness varied by product and declined with increasing age. FUNDING: This study was funded by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO, World Health Organization (WHO)). PAHO convened and led the study implementation."	"2667-193x

Its continued burden and the impact of annually reformulated vaccines remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To project COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from April 2023-April 2025 under two plausible assumptions about immune escape (20% per year and 50% per year) and three possible CDC recommendations for the use of annually reformulated vaccines (no vaccine recommendation, vaccination for those aged 65+, vaccination for all eligible groups). DESIGN: The COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub solicited projections of COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths between April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025 under six scenarios representing the intersection of considered levels of immune escape and vaccination. State and national projections from eight modeling teams were ensembled to produce projections for each scenario. SETTING: The entire United States. PARTICIPANTS: None. EXPOSURE: Annually reformulated vaccines assumed to be 65% effective against strains circulating on June 15 of each year and to become available on September 1. Age and state specific coverage in recommended groups was assumed to match that seen for the first (fall 2021) COVID-19 booster. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Ensemble estimates of weekly and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Expected relative and absolute reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to vaccination over the projection period. RESULTS: From April 15, 2023-April 15, 2025, COVID-19 is projected to cause annual epidemics peaking November-January. In the most pessimistic scenario (high immune escape, no vaccination recommendation), we project 2.1 million (90% PI: 1,438,000-4,270,000) hospitalizations and 209,000 (90% PI: 139,000-461,000) deaths, exceeding pre-pandemic mortality of influenza and pneumonia. In high immune escape scenarios, vaccination of those aged 65+ results in 230,000 (95% CI: 104,000-355,000) fewer hospitalizations and 33,000 (95% CI: 12,000-54,000) fewer deaths, while vaccination of all eligible individuals results in 431,000 (95% CI: 264,000-598,000) fewer hospitalizations and 49,000 (95% CI: 29,000-69,000) fewer deaths. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: COVID-19 is projected to be a significant public health threat over the coming two years. Broad vaccination has the potential to substantially reduce the burden of this disease."	"Jung, Sung-Mok

Given the ambiguity in establishing COVID-19 as the direct cause of death, we first investigate the effects of age and sex on all-cause mortality during 2020 and 2021 in England and Wales. Since infectious agents have their own unique age profile for death, we use a 9-year time series and several different methods to adjust single-year-of-age deaths in England and Wales during 2019 (the pre-COVID-19 base year) to a pathogen-neutral single-year-of-age baseline. This adjusted base year is then used to confirm the widely reported higher deaths in males for most ages above 43 in both 2020 and 2021. During 2020 (+COVID-19 but no vaccination), both male and female population-adjusted deaths significantly increased above age 35. A significant reduction in all-cause mortality among both males and females aged 75+ could be demonstrated in 2021 during the widespread COVID-19 vaccination period; however, deaths below age 75 progressively increased. This finding arises from a mix of vaccination coverage and year-of-age profiles of deaths for the different SARS-CoV-2 variants. In addition, specific effects of age around puberty were demonstrated, where females had higher deaths than males. There is evidence that year-of-birth cohorts may also be involved, indicating that immune priming to specific pathogen outbreaks in the past may have led to lower deaths for some birth cohorts. To specifically identify the age profile for the COVID-19 variants from 2020 to 2023, we employ the proportion of total deaths at each age that are potentially due to or 'with' COVID-19. The original Wuhan strain and the Alpha variant show somewhat limited divergence in the age profile, with the Alpha variant shifting to a moderately higher proportion of deaths below age 84. The Delta variant specifically targeted individuals below age 65. The Omicron variants showed a significantly lower proportion of overall mortality, with a markedly higher relative proportion of deaths above age 65, steeply increasing with age to a maximum around 100 years of age. A similar age profile for the variants can be seen in the age-banded deaths in US states, although they are slightly obscured by using age bands rather than single years of age. However, the US data shows that higher male deaths are greatly dependent on age and the COVID variant. Deaths assessed to be 'due to' COVID-19 (as opposed to 'involving' COVID-19) in England and Wales were especially overestimated in 2021 relative to the change in all-cause mortality. This arose as a by-product of an increase in COVID-19 testing capacity in late 2020. Potential structure-function mechanisms for the age-specificity of SARS-CoV-2 variants are discussed, along with potential roles for small noncoding RNAs (miRNAs). Using data from England, it is possible to show that the unvaccinated do indeed have a unique age profile for death from each variant and that vaccination alters the shape of the age profile in a manner dependent on age, sex, and the variant. The question is posed as to whether vaccines based on different variants carry a specific age profile."	"2036-7449

Reports of COVID-19 vaccine-related cardiac complications may contribute to vaccine hesitancy in patients with HF. METHODS: To analyze the impact of COVID-19 vaccine status on clinical outcomes in patients with HF, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of the association of COVID-19 vaccination status with hospitalizations, intensive care unit admission and mortality after adjustment for covariates. Inverse probability treatment-weighted models were used to adjust for potential confounding. RESULTS: Of 7094 patients with HF, 645 (9.1%) were partially vaccinated, 2200 (31.0%) were fully vaccinated, 1053 were vaccine-boosted (14.8%), and 3196 remained unvaccinated (45.1%) by January 2022. The mean age was 73.3 ± 14.5 years, and 48% were female. Lower mortality rates were observed in patients who were vaccine-boosted, followed by those who were fully vaccinated; they experienced lower mortality rates (HR 0.33; CI 0.23, 0.48) and 0.36 (CI 0.30, 0.43), respectively, compared to unvaccinated individuals (P< 0.001) over the mean follow-up time of 276.5 ± 104.9 days, whereas no difference was observed between those who were unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccination was associated with significant reduction in all-cause hospitalization rates and mortality rates, lending further evidence to support the importance of vaccination implementation in the high-risk population of patients living with HF."

Vaccination"	"On September 1, 2022, CDC recommended an updated (bivalent) COVID-19 vaccine booster to help restore waning protection conferred by previous vaccination and broaden protection against emerging variants for persons aged ≥12 years (subsequently extended to persons aged ≥6 months).* To assess the impact of original (monovalent) COVID-19 vaccines and bivalent boosters, case and mortality rate ratios (RRs) were estimated comparing unvaccinated and vaccinated persons aged ≥12 years by overall receipt of and by time since booster vaccination (monovalent or bivalent) during Delta variant and Omicron sublineage (BA.1, BA.2, early BA.4/BA.5, and late BA.4/BA.5) predominance.(†) During the late BA.4/BA.5 period, unvaccinated persons had higher COVID-19 mortality and infection rates than persons receiving bivalent doses (mortality RR = 14.1 and infection RR = 2.8) and to a lesser extent persons vaccinated with only monovalent doses (mortality RR = 5.4 and infection RR = 2.5). Among older adults, mortality rates among unvaccinated persons were significantly higher than among those who had received a bivalent booster (65-79 years; RR = 23.7 and ≥80 years; 10.3) or a monovalent booster (65-79 years; 8.3 and ≥80 years; 4.2). In a second analysis stratified by time since booster vaccination, there was a progressive decline from the Delta period (RR = 50.7) to the early BA.4/BA.5 period (7.4) in relative COVID-19 mortality rates among unvaccinated persons compared with persons receiving who had received a monovalent booster within 2 weeks-2 months. During the early BA.4/BA.5 period, declines in relative mortality rates were observed at 6-8 (RR = 4.6), 9-11 (4.5), and ≥12 (2.5) months after receiving a monovalent booster. In contrast, bivalent boosters received during the preceding 2 weeks-2 months improved protection against death (RR = 15.2) during the late BA.4/BA.5 period. In both analyses, when compared with unvaccinated persons, persons who had received bivalent boosters were provided additional protection against death over monovalent doses or monovalent boosters. Restored protection was highest in older adults. All persons should stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccination, including receipt of a bivalent booster by eligible persons, to reduce the risk for severe COVID-19."	"1545-861x

The aim of this study was to identify outcomes in patients with cirrhosis who developed postvaccination COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study among US veterans with cirrhosis and postvaccination or unvaccinated COVID-19. Patients were considered fully vaccinated if COVID-19 was diagnosed 14 days after the second dose of either the Pfizer BNT162b2, the Moderna 1273-mRNA, or the single-dose Janssen Ad.26.COV2.S vaccines and partially vaccinated if COVID-19 was diagnosed 7 days after the first dose of any vaccine but prior to full vaccination. We investigated the association of postvaccination COVID-19 with mortality. RESULTS: We identified 3242 unvaccinated and 254 postvaccination COVID-19 patients with cirrhosis (82 after full and 172 after partial vaccination). In a multivariable analysis of a 1:2 propensity-matched cohort including vaccinated (n = 254) and unvaccinated (n = 508) participants, postvaccination COVID-19 was associated with reduced risk of death (adjusted HR [aHR], 0.21; 95% CI, 0.11-0.42). The reduction was observed after both full (aHR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.63) and partial (aHR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07-0.54) vaccination, following the 1273-mRNA (aHR, 0.12; 95% CI 0.04-0.37) and BNT162b2 (aHR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.10-0.71) vaccines and among patients with compensated (aHR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.08-0.45) and decompensated (aHR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08-0.90) cirrhosis. Findings were consistent in a sensitivity analysis restricted to participants who developed COVID-19 after vaccine availability. CONCLUSIONS: Though patients with cirrhosis can develop breakthrough COVID-19 after full or partial vaccination, these infections are associated with reduced mortality."	"1527-3350

Currently, many countries vaccinate their population in descending order of age (i.e., descending order of fatality rate) to minimize the deaths caused by the disease; however, the effectiveness of this strategy needs to be quantitatively assessed. We employ the susceptible-infected-recovered-dead model to investigate various vaccination strategies. We constructed a metapopulation model with heterogeneous contact and fatality rates and investigated the effectiveness of vaccination strategies to reduce epidemic mortality. We found that the fatality-based strategy, which is currently employed in many countries, is more effective when the contagion rate is high and vaccine supply is low, but the contact-based method outperforms the fatality-based strategy when there is a sufficiently high supply of the vaccine. We identified a discontinuous transition of the optimal vaccination strategy and path-dependency analogous to hysteresis. This transition and path-dependency imply that combining the fatality-based and contact-based strategies is ineffective in reducing the number of deaths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such phenomena occur in real-world epidemic diseases, such as tuberculosis and COVID-19. We also show that the conclusions of this research are valid even when the complex epidemic stages, efficacy of the vaccine, and reinfection are considered."	"1089-7682

METHODS: Data from South Africa's SARS-CoV-2 case linelist, national COVID-19 hospital surveillance system, and Electronic Vaccine Data System were linked and analyzed. Wave periods were defined when the country passed a weekly incidence of 30 cases/100 000 population. In-hospital case fatality ratios (CFRs) during the Delta, Omicron BA.1/BA.2, and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 waves were compared using post-imputation random effect multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: The CFR was 25.9% (N = 37 538 of 144 778), 10.9% (N = 6123 of 56 384), and 8.2% (N = 1212 of 14 879) in the Delta, Omicron BA.1/BA.2, and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 waves, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbidities, health sector, and province, compared with the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 wave, patients had higher risk of mortality in the Omicron BA.1/BA.2 wave (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-1.4) and Delta wave (aOR, 3.0; 95% CI: 2.8-3.2). Being partially vaccinated (aOR, 0.9; 95% CI: .9-.9), fully vaccinated (aOR, 0.6; 95% CI: .6-.7), and boosted (aOR, 0.4; 95% CI: .4-.5) and having prior laboratory-confirmed infection (aOR, 0.4; 95% CI: .3-.4) were associated with reduced risks of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, admission incidence risk and in-hospital mortality, which had increased progressively in South Africa's first 3 waves, decreased in the fourth Omicron BA.1/BA.2 wave and declined even further in the fifth Omicron BA.4/BA.5 wave. Mortality risk was lower in those with natural infection and vaccination, declining further as the number of vaccine doses increased."	"1537-6591

In this national cohort study, 24 016 intensive care unit (ICU) coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) admissions were included from January to April 2022. The mortality and length of ICU stay were compared between the vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. A total of 9428 (39.25%) patients were unvaccinated, and 14 588 (60.75%) patients had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Compared with the unvaccinated, the first, second, and third doses of vaccine resulted in 8%, 20%, and 33% lower risk of ICU mortality in the adjusted model, with risk ratio (RR): 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84-1.001, RR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.77-0.83, and RR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.64-0.71, respectively. The mean survival time was significantly shorter in the unvaccinated versus the fully vaccinated patients (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.80-0.88); p < 0.001). All vaccine platforms successfully decreased the hazard of ICU death compared with the unvaccinated group. The duration of ICU stay was significantly shorter in the fully vaccinated than in unvaccinated group (MD, -0.62, 95% CI: -0.82 to -0.42; p < 0.001). Since COVID-19 vaccination in all doses and platforms has been able to reduce the risk of mortality and length of ICU-stay, universal vaccination is recommended based on vaccine availability."

However, a few recipients developed unusual side effects, including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). We aim to systematically review the baseline features, clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes in patients developing CVST post-COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: This study was conducted according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) 2020 guideline. Investigators independently searched PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar for English language articles published from inception up until September 10, 2021, reporting the incidence of CVST post-COVID-19 vaccines. We analyzed CVST patients' baseline data, type of vaccines, clinical findings, treatment, and outcomes. Our systematic review process yielded patient-level data. RESULT: The final analysis included 25 studies that identified 80 patients who developed CVST after the COVID-19 vaccination. Of the 80 CVST cases, 31 (39.24%) patients died. There was no significant relationship between mortality and age (P = .733), sex (P = .095), vaccine type (P = .798), platelet count (P = .93), and comorbidities such as hypertension (P = .734) and diabetes mellitus (P = .758). However, mortality was associated with the duration of onset of CVST symptoms after vaccination (P = .022). Patients with CVST post-COVID-19 vaccination were more likely to survive if treated with an anticoagulant (P = .039). Patients who developed intracranial hemorrhage (P = .012) or thrombosis in the cortical vein (P = .021) were more likely to die. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccine-associated CVST is associated with high mortality rate. Timely diagnosis and management can be lifesaving for patients."	"2150-1327

AIM: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of vaccination against COVID-19 in patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with cirrhosis. The first cohort included patients vaccinated with Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V); the second one consisted of unvaccinated controls. RESULTS: The study included 89 vaccinated patients and 148 unvaccinated ones. There were 4 cases of COVID-19 in the vaccinated group and 24 cases in the unvaccinated group (P = 0.035). No severe cases of COVID-19 were revealed in the vaccinated group, while there were 12 ones in the unvaccinated group (P = 0.012) with 10 deaths detected (P = 0.012). The vaccine efficacy was 69.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.5%-94.4%) against symptomatic cases of COVID-19, 100% (95%CI: 25.1%-100.0%) against severe cases, and 100% (95%CI: 1.6%-100.0%) against death associated with COVID-19. The efficacy of full vaccination with revaccination against symptomatic cases of COVID-19 was 88.3% (95%CI: 48.0%-99.6%). The overall mortality rate was higher in the unvaccinated group than in the vaccinated group (17.1% vs 3.0%; P = 0.001). Higher Child-Turcotte-Pugh class cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.13, 95%CI: 1.82-9.35) and higher age (HR = 1.08, 95%CI: 1.04-1.15) were independent predictors of overall mortality, while vaccination had a protective effect (HR = 0.09, 95%CI: 0.01-0.76). There was no significant difference in liver-related mortality (P = 0.135) or the incidence of liver decompensation (P = 0.077), bleeding esophageal varices (P = 0.397), and vascular events (P = 0.651) between the two groups of patients. CONCLUSION: Vaccination against COVID-19 in patients with cirrhosis is effective and safe."	"1948-5182

SARS-CoV-2"	"INTRODUCTION: The Plurinational State of Bolivia (Bolivia) has experienced four major waves of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) so far. Although the ministry of health has been tracking morbidity and mortality through each wave, epidemiology of COVID-19 in Bolivia is not well defined, despite a need for more accurate measurement of the number of cases and deaths to allow for forecasting of the pandemic. This study examined prevalence of COVID-19 at community level, determinants of its occurrence and vaccine effectiveness. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in La Paz city on 2,775 individuals between March 2020 and February 2022. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on COVID-19 morbidity, mortality and vaccination status. RESULTS: Of the 2,775 participants, 1,586 (57.1%) were infected with COVID-19, and 187 (6.7%) were suspected cases. The mortality rate was 2.9%. Sinopharm, Johnson & Johnson, Gamaleya, Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna and AstraZeneka vaccines are in use, and all vaccines have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing the risk of onset. Risk for mortality was significantly lower in the vaccinated group with an odds ratio of 0.037 (95％ confidential interval: 0.01-0.10, p-value: <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Actual prevalence of COVID-19 in La Paz (the prevalence rate: 63.8%, including suspected case) was higher than that reported by the Ministry of Health and Sports in Bolivia (7.5%). In addition, vaccination has contributed significantly to the control of the COVID-19 epidemic in Bolivia. We believe that our report will be useful for COVID-19 prevention strategies in Bolivia for the future."	"1437-7780

The rapid and accurate estimation of the risk of severe disease in new patients is needed to prioritize the treatment of high-risk patients and maximize lives saved. We used electronic health records from 101,039 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, since the beginning of the pandemic and until 30 November 2021, in a national healthcare organization in Israel to build logistic models estimating the probability of subsequent hospitalization and death of newly infected patients based on a few major risk factors (age, sex, body mass index, hemoglobin A1C, kidney function, and the presence of hypertension, pulmonary disease, and malignancy) and the number of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine doses received. The model's performance was assessed by 10-fold cross-validation: the area under the curve was 0.889 for predicting hospitalization and 0.967 for predicting mortality. A total of 50%, 80%, and 90% of death events could be predicted with respective specificities of 98.6%, 95.2%, and 91.2%. These models enable the rapid identification of individuals at high risk for hospitalization and death when infected, and they can be used to prioritize patients to receive scarce medications or booster vaccination. The calculator is available online."	"2076-2607

COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-related myocarditis is noted to have a more benign course. Despite these findings, there is a need for a larger population systematic review that compares the outcomes to pre-pandemic acute myocarditis to better understand the extent of the current post-COVID state. METHODS: We performed a literature search with PubMed and EMBASE and identified studies investigating COVID-19 and its vaccinated population, and the population prior to the pandemic (control group) who had myocarditis. We performed a one-group meta-analysis of the incidence, baseline demographics, and outcomes of myocarditis for each group. RESULTS: The incidence in the SARS-CoV-2 infection group was 2.76 per thousand (95% CI, 0.85-8.92), 19.7 per million (95% CI, 12.3-31.6) in the vaccine group, and 0.861 per million (95% CI, 0.04-16.7) in the control group. The majority of patients were male, with the highest proportion in the vaccine group. The mean age was the youngest in the vaccine group (24.8, 95% CI, 19.1-30.6). The vaccine group had the lowest mortality (2.0%, 95% CI, 1.3-2.7) followed by the control and the SARS-CoV-2 infection group. The vaccine group had the lowest proportion of immunoglobulin and glucocorticoid use, mechanical circulatory support, and cardiogenic shock. CONCLUSION: Our study showed favorable outcomes of myocarditis in patients with COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, despite a higher incidence than pre-COVID controls. Further studies with standardized myocarditis diagnostic criteria assessing long-term outcomes are necessary."	"1874-1754

OBJECTIVE: To develop a model that estimates the risk of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality among all enrollees of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study used data from 7 635 064 individuals enrolled in the VA health care system as of May 21, 2020, to develop and internally validate a logistic regression model (COVIDVax) that predicted SARS-CoV-2-related death (n = 2422) during the observation period (May 21 to November 2, 2020) using baseline characteristics known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, extracted from the VA electronic health records (EHRs). The cohort was split into a training period (May 21 to September 30) and testing period (October 1 to November 2). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SARS-CoV-2-related death, defined as death within 30 days of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. VA EHR data streams were imported on a data integration platform to demonstrate that the model could be executed in real-time to produce dashboards with risk scores for all current VA enrollees. RESULTS: Of 7 635 064 individuals, the mean (SD) age was 66.2 (13.8) years, and most were men (7 051 912 [92.4%]) and White individuals (4 887 338 [64.0%]), with 1 116 435 (14.6%) Black individuals and 399 634 (5.2%) Hispanic individuals. From a starting pool of 16 potential predictors, 10 were included in the final COVIDVax model, as follows: sex, age, race, ethnicity, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and Care Assessment Need score. The model exhibited excellent discrimination with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 85.3% (95% CI, 84.6%-86.1%), superior to the AUROC of using age alone to stratify risk (72.6%; 95% CI, 71.6%-73.6%). Assuming vaccination is 90% effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2-related death, using this model to prioritize vaccination was estimated to prevent 63.5% of deaths that would occur by the time 50% of VA enrollees are vaccinated, significantly higher than the estimate for prioritizing vaccination based on age (45.6%) or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention phases of vaccine allocation (41.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this prognostic study of all VA enrollees, prioritizing vaccination based on the COVIDVax model was estimated to prevent a large proportion of deaths expected to occur during vaccine rollout before sufficient herd immunity is achieved."

OBJECTIVE: To determine mRNA booster vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death in the Omicron era by booster type, primary vaccine type, time since primary vaccination, age, and comorbidity burden. DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study designed to emulate a target trial of booster vaccination versus no booster, conducted from 1 December 2021 to 31 March 2022. SETTING: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs health care system. PARTICIPANTS: Persons who had received 2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses at least 5 months earlier. INTERVENTION: Booster monovalent mRNA vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech's BNT162b2 or Moderna's mRNA-1273) versus no booster. MEASUREMENTS: Booster VE. RESULTS: Each group included 490 838 well-matched persons, who were predominantly male (88%), had a mean age of 63.0 years (SD, 14.0), and were followed for up to 121 days (mean, 79.8 days). Booster VE more than 10 days after a booster dose was 42.3% (95% CI, 40.6% to 43.9%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 53.3% (CI, 48.1% to 58.0%) against SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization, and 79.1% (CI, 71.2% to 84.9%) against SARS-CoV-2-related death. Booster VE was similar for different booster types (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273), age groups, and primary vaccination regimens but was significantly higher with longer time since primary vaccination and higher comorbidity burden. LIMITATION: Predominantly male population. CONCLUSION: Booster mRNA vaccination was highly effective in preventing death and moderately effective in preventing infection and hospitalization for up to 4 months after administration in the Omicron era. Increased uptake of booster vaccination, which is currently suboptimal, should be pursued to limit the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in persons with high comorbidity burden.

Although studies have assessed homologous schedules in detail, the effectiveness of heterologous booster vaccine schedules against severity and mortality with newer variants remains to be explored fully. METHODS: Utilizing a Hospital Information System for COVID-19 established in Chiang Mai, Thailand, we conducted a cohort study by linking patient-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases to the national immunization records, during delta-predominant and omicron-predominant periods. RESULTS: Compared to omicron, COVID-19 cases during the delta period were 10 times more likely to have severe outcomes and in-hospital deaths. During omicron, a third vaccine dose had an 89% reduced risk of both severe COVID-19 and death. The third dose received 14-90 days before the date of the positive test showed the highest protection (93%). Severe outcomes were not observed with the third dose during delta, and the fourth dose during the omicron period. All the vaccine types used for boosting in Thailand offered similar protection against severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Booster doses provided a very high level of protection against severe COVID-19 outcomes and deaths. Booster campaigns should focus on improving coverage by utilizing all available vaccines to ensure optimal protection."	"1878-3511

We retrospectively collected data on patients &gt; 12 years old from 01/01/2021 to 12/30/2021 who received COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination and were diagnosed with myocarditis within 60 days of vaccination. Myocarditis cases were based on case definitions by authors. We report on 238 patients of whom most were male (n = 208; 87.1%). The mean age was 27.4 ± 16 (range 12-80) years. Females presented at older ages (41.3 ± 21.5 years) than men 25.7 ± 14 years (p = 0.001). In patients &gt; 20 years of age, the mean duration from vaccination to symptoms was 4.8 days ± 5.5 days, but in &lt; 20, it was 3.0 ± 3.3 days (p = 0.04). Myocarditis occurred most commonly after the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (n = 183; 76.45) and after the second dose (n = 182; 80%). Symptoms started 3.95 ± 4.5 days after vaccination. The commonest symptom was chest pain (n = 221; 93%). Patients were treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n = 105; 58.3%), colchicine (n = 38; 21.1%), or glucocorticoids (n = 23; 12.7%). About 30% of the patients had left ventricular ejection fraction but more than half recovered the on repeat imaging. Abnormal cardiac MRIs were common; 168 patients (96% of 175 patients that had MRI) had late gadolinium enhancement, while 120 patients (68.5%) had myocardial edema. Heart failure guideline-directed medical therapy use was common (n = 27; 15%). Eleven patients had cardiogenic shock; and 4 patients required mechanical circulatory support. Five patients (1.7%) died; of these, 3 patients had endomyocardial biopsy/autopsy-confirmed myocarditis. Most cases of COVID-19 vaccine myocarditis are mild. Females presented at older ages than men and duration from vaccination to symptoms was longer in patients &gt; 20 years. Cardiogenic shock requiring mechanical circulatory support was seen and mortality was low. Future studies are needed to better evaluate risk factors, and long-term outcomes of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine myocarditis."	"1573-7322

Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure against the disease. This study aimed to assess the mortality rates of COVID-19 patients in the United States and the effectiveness of Pfizer (Pfizer, NY, USA), Moderna (Moderna, MA, USA), and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson, NJ, USA) vaccines in preventing mortality. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-2020) guidelines. Eligible studies reporting on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines on patient outcomes were included. The search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases. The data were extracted, and risk ratios (RR) were calculated for mortality outcomes. The analysis was performed using Review Manager software, and bias assessments were conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Meta-Analysis tools. A total of seven studies with 21,618,297 COVID-19 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality among unvaccinated patients compared to vaccinated patients was 2.46 (95% CI: 1.71-3.53), indicating that unvaccinated patients were 2.46 times more likely to die from COVID-19. The findings of this study support the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in reducing mortality among infected individuals. Unvaccinated patients had a significantly higher risk of mortality compared to vaccinated patients. Vaccination remains a crucial strategy to mitigate the severity of the disease and reduce mortality rates. Efforts should be made to address vaccine hesitancy and ensure widespread vaccine coverage."

Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia"	"AIMS: The clinical manifestation and outcomes of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) after adenoviral COVID-19 vaccine administration are largely unknown due to the rare nature of the disease. We aimed to analyse the clinical presentation, treatment modalities, outcomes, and prognostic factors of adenoviral TTS, as well as identify predictors for mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched and the resulting articles were reviewed. A total of 6 case series and 13 case reports (64 patients) of TTS after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination were included. We performed a pooled analysis and developed a novel scoring system to predict mortality. The overall mortality of TTS after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination was 35.9% (23/64). In our analysis, age ≤60 years, platelet count <25 × 103/µL, fibrinogen <150 mg/dL, the presence of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), and the presence of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) were significantly associated with death and were selected as predictors for mortality (1 point each). We named this novel scoring system FAPIC (fibrinogen, age, platelet count, ICH, and CVT), and the C-statistic for the FAPIC score was 0.837 (95% CI 0.732-0.942). Expected mortality increased with each point increase in the FAPIC score, at 2.08, 6.66, 19.31, 44.54, 72.94, and 90.05% with FAPIC scores 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The FAPIC scoring model was internally validated through cross-validation and bootstrapping, then externally validated on a panel of TTS patients after Ad26.COV2.S administration. CONCLUSIONS: Fibrinogen levels, age, platelet count, and the presence of ICH and CVT were significantly associated with mortality in patients with TTS, and the FAPIC score comprising these risk factors could predict mortality. The FAPIC score could be used in the clinical setting to recognize TTS patients at high risk of adverse outcomes and provide early intensive interventions including intravenous immunoglobulins and non-heparin anticoagulants."

In addition, the study aims to identify the characteristics of countries that had good performances. We analyzed observation data among 29 countries over the first eight weeks during the two periods of Delta and Omicron variant dominance. Data were extracted from open public databases. The Omicron variant caused a lowered mortality rate per 100,000 COVID-19 patients; however, it is still imposing a colossal burden on health care systems. We found the percentage of the population fully vaccinated and high government indices were significantly associated with a better resilience index in both the Delta and Omicron periods. In contrast, the higher death rate of cancers and greater years lived with disability (YLD) caused by low bone density were linked with poor resilience index in the Omicron periods. Over two periods of Delta and Omicron, countries with good performance had a lower death rate from chronic diseases and lower YLD caused by nutrition deficiency and PM2.5. Our findings suggest that governments need to keep enhancing the vaccine coverage rates, developing interventions for populations with chronic diseases and nutrition deficiency to mitigate COVID-19 impacts on these targeted vulnerable cohorts."

vaccination"	"COVID-19 remains a stark health threat worldwide, in part because of minimal levels of targeted vaccination outside high-income countries and highly transmissible variants causing infection in vaccinated individuals. Decades of theoretical and experimental data suggest that nonspecific effects of non-COVID-19 vaccines may help bolster population immunological resilience to new pathogens. These routine vaccinations can stimulate heterologous cross-protective effects, which modulate nontargeted infections. For example, immunization with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, inactivated influenza vaccine, oral polio vaccine, and other vaccines have been associated with some protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and amelioration of COVID-19 disease. If heterologous vaccine interventions (HVIs) are to be seriously considered by policy makers as bridging or boosting interventions in pandemic settings to augment nonpharmaceutical interventions and specific vaccination efforts, evidence is needed to determine their optimal implementation. Using the COVID-19 International Modeling Consortium mathematical model, we show that logistically realistic HVIs with low (5 to 15%) effectiveness could have reduced COVID-19 cases, hospitalization, and mortality in the United States fall/winter 2020 wave. Similar to other mass drug administration campaigns (e.g., for malaria), HVI impact is highly dependent on both age targeting and intervention timing in relation to incidence, with maximal benefit accruing from implementation across the widest age cohort when the pandemic reproduction number is >1.0. Optimal HVI logistics therefore differ from optimal rollout parameters for specific COVID-19 immunizations. These results may be generalizable beyond COVID-19 and the US to indicate how even minimally effective heterologous immunization campaigns could reduce the burden of future viral pandemics."

A retrospective cohort study, with data from 148 hospitals in both Spain (111 hospitals) and Argentina (37 hospitals), was conducted. We evaluated hospitalized patients for COVID-19 older than 18 years with oxygen requirements. Vaccine protection against death was assessed through a multivariable logistic regression and propensity score matching. We also performed a subgroup analysis according to vaccine type. The adjusted model was used to determine the population attributable risk. Between January 2020 and May 2022, we evaluated 21,479 COVID-19 hospitalized patients with oxygen requirements. Of these, 338 (1.5%) patients received a single dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and 379 (1.8%) were fully vaccinated. In vaccinated patients, mortality was 20.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.9-24), compared to 19.5% (95% CI: 19-20) in unvaccinated patients, resulting in a crude odds ratio (OR) of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.89-1.29; p = 0.41). However, after considering the multiple comorbidities in the vaccinated group, the adjusted OR was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56-0.95; p = 0.02) with a population attributable risk reduction of 4.3% (95% CI: 1-5). The higher risk reduction for mortality was with messenger RNA (mRNA) BNT162b2 (Pfizer) (OR 0.37; 95% CI: 0.23-0.59; p < 0.01), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) (OR 0.42; 95% CI: 0.20-0.86; p = 0.02), and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) (OR 0.68; 95% CI: 0.41-1.12; p = 0.13), and lower with Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik) (OR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.6-1.45; p = 0.76). COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduce the probability of death in patients suffering from a moderate or severe disease (oxygen therapy)."	"1096-9071

Vaccination"	"OBJECTIVE: The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in the death of up to 5 million people worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 2%. Wearing masks, maintaining social distance, tracking, and isolating close contacts are not sufficient to control the epidemic. The effectiveness of vaccines is affected by the willingness of people to be vaccinated. Therefore, in this review, we aimed to examine the efficacy of different types of vaccines in reducing hospitalization rates, disease severity, and mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched five databases (Embase, PubMed, Cochrane, EBSCO, and CEPS) for related research on September 3, 2021. We used a random-effects model for analysis. RESULTS: Seven studies were identified, involving 1,366,700 participants (689,967 participants in the vaccinated group and 676,733 participants in the non-vaccinated group). There were 292 significant incidents (56 in the vaccinated group and 236 in the non-vaccinated group) with a risk ratio of 0.12 and a 95% confidence interval of 0.040-0.363. Compared with no vaccine, all types of vaccines can effectively prevent the rate of severe illness. CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated whether different brands of vaccines or types of COVID-19 vaccines could prevent the risk of severe illness after diagnosis. The analysis showed that all types of vaccines can effectively prevent severe disease. Implementing epidemic prevention guidelines and obtaining vaccines in different countries can improve vaccine protection and reduce COVID-19-related deaths worldwide."	"2284-0729

The vaccination data set uses the most recent official numbers from governments and health ministries worldwide. We assessed the correlation between COVID-19 vaccine coverage rates and outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic with existing variants by performing temporal analysis and spatial analysis. Overall, new cases per million population, the reproduction rate of COVID-19, new deaths from all causes per million population, excess mortality attributed to COVID-19 pandemic, and hospital patients or intensive care unit (ICU) patients per million population were not decreased with the time course. However, at the same time point, new cases per million population, the reproduction rate of COVID-19, new deaths per million population, and hospital patients or ICU patients per million population gradually decreased as the rate of vaccination coverage increased. High coverage percentages of COVID-19 vaccination were negatively correlated with the reproduction rate of COVID-19 (correlation coefficient -0.116) and ICU patients per million of the local population (correlation coefficient -0.055). Currently, there is no effective treatment for the COVID-19 pandemic, and prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic mainly depends on vaccines, especially when the rate of COVID-19 vaccine coverage is over 60%. The benefits of preventing severe disease and preventing transmission of infection are likely to be obvious."	"1096-9071

This study examined the association of COVID-19 deaths per 1000 cases with a fully vaccinated population. The global median deaths per 1000 cases were 15.68 (IQR 9.84, 25.87) after 6 months of vaccinations and 11.96 (IQR 6.08, 20.63) after 12 months. Across 164 countries, we found significant variations in vaccination levels of populations, booster doses, and mortality, with higher vaccine coverage and lower mortality in high-income countries. Several regression models were performed to test the association between vaccination and COVID-19 mortality. Control variables were used to account for confounding variables. A 10-percentage-point increase in vaccination was associated with an 18.1% decrease in mortality after 6 months (95%CI, 7.4-28.8%) and a 16.8% decrease after 12 months (95%CI, 6.9-26.7%). A 10-percentage-point increase in booster vaccination rates was associated with a 33.1% decrease in COVID-19 mortality (95%CI, 16.0-50.2%). This relationship is present in most analyses by country income groups with variations in the effect size.

Vaccine response"	"BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) experienced reduced SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response and were at increased risk of severe COVID-19. It is unknown if level of vaccine induced anti-receptor binding domain IgG (anti-RBD IgG) correlates with protection from and survival following COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the effect of vaccine response on risk of breakthrough infections (BTI) and COVID-19 death in KTRs. METHODS: We performed a nationwide study, examining the competing risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related/unrelated death, and vaccine efficacy as assessed by level of anti-RBD IgG response 4-10 weeks after each vaccination. The study included all KTR in Norway alive and with a functioning graft on February 20th, 2020, and events after November 11th, 2022 were right-censored. A pre-pandemic reference-cohort from January 1st 2019 to January 1st 2020 was included to evaluate excess mortality. The study was conducted at Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Norway. FINDINGS: The study included 3607 KTRs (59 [48-70] years) with a functioning graft at February 20th, 2020, who received (median [IQR]) 4 [3-4] vaccines (range 2-6, 99% mRNA). Anti-RBD IgG was measured in 12 701 serum samples provided by 3213 KTRs. Vaccine response was assessed 41 [31-57] days after vaccination. A total of 1090 KTRs were infected with SARS-CoV-2, 1005 (92%) were BTI, and vaccine response did not protect against BTI. The hazard ratio for COVID-19 related death 40 days post-infection was 1.71 (95% CI: 1.14, 2.56) comparing vaccine response levels (≥5 vs. ≥5000 BAU/mL). No excess non-COVID-19 mortality was registered in KTRs surviving SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to a 2019 pre-pandemic reference. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggested that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine response did not predict protection against infection, but prevention of fatal disease progression in KTRs and greater vaccine response further reduced the risk of COVID-19 death. No excess non-COVID-19 mortality was seen during the pandemic. FUNDING: CEPI and internal funds."	"2589-5370

OBJECTIVE: To determine the associations of tumor type with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective, population-based cohort study included community-dwelling adults aged at least 18 years in Ontario, Canada, ICES-linked provincial health databases from January 1, 2020, to November 30, 2021. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2021, to November 1, 2022. EXPOSURES: Cancer diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, and secondary outcomes included all-cause 14-day hospitalization, 21-day ICU admission, and 28-day death following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cox proportional hazards models were used to obtain adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: Of 11 732 108 people in the ICES-linked health databases, 279 287 had cancer (57.2% female; mean [SD] age, 65.9 [16.1] years) and 11 452 821 people did not have cancer (45.7% female; mean [SD] age, 65.9 [16.0] years). Overall, 464 574 individuals (4.1%) developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individuals with hematologic malignant neoplasms (33 901 individuals) were at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13-1.25), 14-day hospitalization (aHR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.57-1.96), and 28-day mortality (aHR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.74-2.38) compared with the overall population, while individuals with solid tumors (245 386 individuals) were at lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91-0.95) but increased risk of 14-day hospitalization (aHR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05-1.18) and 28-day mortality (aHR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.19-1.44). The 28-day mortality rate was high in hospitalized patients with hematologic malignant neoplasms (163 of 321 hospitalized patients [50.7%]) or solid tumors (486 of 1060 hospitalized patients [45.8%]). However, the risk of 21-day ICU admission in patients with hematologic malignant neoplasms (aHR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.93-1.40) or solid tumors (aHR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.82-1.05) was not significantly different from that among individuals without cancer. The SARS-CoV-2 infection risk decreased stepwise with increasing numbers of COVID-19 vaccine doses received (1 dose: aHR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.62-0.63; 2 doses: aHR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.16-0.16; 3 doses: aHR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.04-0.06). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings highlight the importance of prioritization strategies regarding ICU access to reduce the mortality risk in increased-risk populations, such as patients with cancer."

However, with evidence of waning efficacy coupled with continued evolution of the virus, health programmes need to evaluate the requirement for regular booster doses, considering their impact and cost-effectiveness in the face of ongoing transmission and substantial infection-induced immunity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a combined immunological-transmission model parameterised with data on transmissibility, severity, and vaccine effectiveness. We simulated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and vaccine rollout in characteristic global settings with different population age-structures, contact patterns, health system capacities, prior transmission, and vaccine uptake. We quantified the impact of future vaccine booster dose strategies with both ancestral and variant-adapted vaccine products, while considering the potential future emergence of new variants with modified transmission, immune escape, and severity properties. We found that regular boosting of the oldest age group (75+) is an efficient strategy, although large numbers of hospitalisations and deaths could be averted by extending vaccination to younger age groups. In countries with low vaccine coverage and high infection-derived immunity, boosting older at-risk groups was more effective than continuing primary vaccination into younger ages in our model. Our study is limited by uncertainty in key parameters, including the long-term durability of vaccine and infection-induced immunity as well as uncertainty in the future evolution of the virus. CONCLUSIONS: Our modelling suggests that regular boosting of the high-risk population remains an important tool to reduce morbidity and mortality from current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our results suggest that focusing vaccination in the highest-risk cohorts will be the most efficient (and hence cost-effective) strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality."	"1549-1676

Amidst the uncertainties faced due to the socioeconomic and public health impact, there is little evidence surrounding COVID-19 vaccination in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Timing of vaccination and postvaccination adverse effects are required parameters to discuss with cardiac surgical patients. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective observational study. All patients who underwent adult cardiac surgery at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong from January 2021 to December 2021 were included. Postoperative clinical outcomes, COVID-19 vaccination status, and vaccination-related adverse effects were collected. RESULTS: A total of 426 patients; 117 (27%) underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting, 111 (26%) underwent valvular surgery, and 97 (23%) underwent aortic surgery. Patients received either Sinovac CoronaVac or Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. Overall vaccination rate with at least 1 dose was 52% (n = 212), 15% (n = 63) received the first dose before surgery, 36% (n = 149) received the first dose vaccination after surgery. Rate of completion with second and third doses of vaccination were 22% (n = 89) and 4.9% (n = 20), respectively. The mean timing of first dose of vaccine after surgery was 216 ± 84 days from operation. Three (1.4%) patients recorded vaccination-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination is safe in patients who received major cardiac surgery, with low adverse effects recorded and no vaccine-related mortality observed. A time frame of 3-6 months after cardiac surgery receiving COVID-19 vaccination is reasonable and could serve as a guidance for future COVID-19 vaccination booster programs."	"1540-8191

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: QResearch database linked to English national data on covid-19 vaccinations, SARS-CoV-2 test results, hospital admissions, and cancer and mortality data, 11 December 2021 to 31 March 2022, with follow-up to 30 June 2022. PARTICIPANTS: 1.3 million adults in the derivation cohort and 0.15 million adults in the validation cohort, aged 18-100 years, with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was covid-19 related death and secondary outcome was hospital admission for covid-19. Risk equations with predictor variables were derived from models fitted in the derivation cohort. Performance was evaluated in a separate validation cohort. RESULTS: Of 1 297 922 people with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the derivation cohort, 18 756 (1.5%) had a covid-19 related hospital admission and 3878 (0.3%) had a covid-19 related death during follow-up. The final QCOVID4 models included age, deprivation score and a range of health and sociodemographic factors, number of covid-19 vaccinations, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The risk of death related to covid-19 was lower among those who had received a covid-19 vaccine, with evidence of a dose-response relation (42% risk reduction associated with one vaccine dose and 92% reduction with four or more doses in men). Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a reduction in the risk of covid-19 related death (49% reduction in men). The QCOVID4 algorithm for covid-19 explained 76.0% (95% confidence interval 73.9% to 78.2%) of the variation in time to covid-19 related death in men with a D statistic of 3.65 (3.43 to 3.86) and Harrell's C statistic of 0.970 (0.962 to 0.979). Results were similar for women. QCOVID4 was well calibrated. QCOVID4 was substantially more efficient than the NHS Digital algorithm for correctly identifying patients at high risk of covid-19 related death. Of the 461 covid-19 related deaths in the validation cohort, 333 (72.2%) were in the QCOVID4 high risk group and 95 (20.6%) in the NHS Digital high risk group. CONCLUSION: The QCOVID4 risk algorithm, modelled from data during the period when the omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was predominant in England, now includes vaccination dose and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and predicted covid-19 related death among people with a positive test result. QCOVID4 more accurately identified individuals at the highest levels of absolute risk for targeted interventions than the approach adopted by NHS Digital. QCOVID4 performed well and could be used for targeting treatments for covid-19 disease."	"1756-1833

DESIGN: Prospective, population based cohort study using the QResearch database linked to data on covid-19 vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 results, hospital admissions, systemic anticancer treatment, radiotherapy, and the national death and cancer registries. SETTINGS: Adults aged 19-100 years with one or two doses of covid-19 vaccination between 8 December 2020 and 15 June 2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was covid-19 related death. Secondary outcome was covid-19 related hospital admission. Outcomes were assessed from 14 days after each vaccination dose. Models were fitted in the derivation cohort to derive risk equations using a range of predictor variables. Performance was evaluated in a separate validation cohort of general practices. RESULTS: Of 6 952 440 vaccinated patients in the derivation cohort, 5 150 310 (74.1%) had two vaccine doses. Of 2031 covid-19 deaths and 1929 covid-19 hospital admissions, 81 deaths (4.0%) and 71 admissions (3.7%) occurred 14 days or more after the second vaccine dose. The risk algorithms included age, sex, ethnic origin, deprivation, body mass index, a range of comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. Incidence of covid-19 mortality increased with age and deprivation, male sex, and Indian and Pakistani ethnic origin. Cause specific hazard ratios were highest for patients with Down's syndrome (12.7-fold increase), kidney transplantation (8.1-fold), sickle cell disease (7.7-fold), care home residency (4.1-fold), chemotherapy (4.3-fold), HIV/AIDS (3.3-fold), liver cirrhosis (3.0-fold), neurological conditions (2.6-fold), recent bone marrow transplantation or a solid organ transplantation ever (2.5-fold), dementia (2.2-fold), and Parkinson's disease (2.2-fold). Other conditions with increased risk (ranging from 1.2-fold to 2.0-fold increases) included chronic kidney disease, blood cancer, epilepsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, thromboembolism, peripheral vascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. A similar pattern of associations was seen for covid-19 related hospital admissions. No evidence indicated that associations differed after the second dose, although absolute risks were reduced. The risk algorithm explained 74.1% (95% confidence interval 71.1% to 77.0%) of the variation in time to covid-19 death in the validation cohort. Discrimination was high, with a D statistic of 3.46 (95% confidence interval 3.19 to 3.73) and C statistic of 92.5. Performance was similar after each vaccine dose. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted covid-19 mortality risk, sensitivity for identifying covid-19 deaths within 70 days was 78.7%. CONCLUSION: This population based risk algorithm performed well showing high levels of discrimination for identifying those patients at highest risk of covid-19 related death and hospital admission after vaccination."

We aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-19 vaccination status on the treatment and outcome of ACS patients. METHODS: The study was based on the 2021 Acute Coronary Syndrome Israeli Survey. Patients were stratified into two groups according to COVID-19 vaccination status, vaccinated compared to unvaccinated. Patients who had received at least 2 vaccination doses up to 1 week prior to ACS hospitalization were considered vaccinated. The primary endpoint was 1-year all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1261 patients with ACS were included, of whom 990 (78.5%) were vaccinated. Vaccinated patients were older and less frequently smokers. There were no significant differences in coronary reperfusion rates and treatment with guideline-based medical therapy during hospital stay and at discharge. The primary endpoint of 1-year all-cause mortality occurred in 38 (3.8%) and 14 (5.2%) patients in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups respectively (P = 0.42). 30-day MACE occurred in 94 (9.5%) in the vaccinated patients compared to 31 (11.5%) in the unvaccinated group (P = 0.39). These results remained similar following adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSION: There was no association between COVID-19 vaccination status and the outcomes of patients with ACS. Our findings provide support for the cardiovascular safety of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in patients at high cardiovascular risk."	"1473-5830

However, the impact of the vaccine used, viral variants, and host factors on disease severity remain poorly understood. This work aimed to compare COVID-19 clinical presentations and outcomes in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in Mexico City. From March to September 2021, clinical, demographic characteristics, and viral variants were obtained from 1014 individuals with a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. We compared unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated patients, stratifying by age groups. We also fitted multivariate statistical models to evaluate the impact of vaccination status, SARS-CoV-2 lineages, vaccine types, and clinical parameters. Most hospitalized patients were unvaccinated. In patients over 61 years old, mortality was significantly higher in unvaccinated compared to fully vaccinated individuals. In patients aged 31 to 60 years, vaccinated patients were more likely to be outpatients (46%) than unvaccinated individuals (6.1%). We found immune disease and age above 61 years old to be risk factors, while full vaccination was found to be the most protective factor against in-hospital death. This study suggests that vaccination is essential to reduce mortality in a comorbid population such as that of Mexico."	"2076-393x

This study aimed to determine the influence of different risk factors on deaths due to the Omicron variant in the Canary Islands. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study of 16,998 cases of COVID-19 over 40 years of age was conducted in the Canary Islands between August 1, 2022, and January 31, 2023. We extracted sociodemographic data (age and sex) and clinical data (death, vaccination history, hospital admission, previous diseases, and treatments). RESULTS: Among the deaths, there was a higher proportion of males aged over 70 years, with diabetes, cardiovascular, renal, respiratory, and systemic diseases, and nursing home residents. Significant differences were observed in the number of doses of the vaccine. The multiple regression model showed that male sex (OR [95% CI]=1.92 [1.42-2.58]), age (70-79 years, 9.11 [4.27-19.43]; 80-89 years, 21.72 [10.40-45.36]; 90-99 years, 66.24 [31.03-141.38]; 100 years or older, 69.22 [12.97-369.33]), being unvaccinated (6.96, [4.01-12.08]), or having the last dose administered at least 12 months before the diagnosis (2.38, [1.48-3.81]) were significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors may increase the risk of mortality due to COVID-19 in the elderly population. In our study, we found that only three predictors can effectively explain the variability: older age, male sex, and not being vaccinated or last vaccination date prior to one year."	"1578-1747

STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: This was a case-control study conducted. The records of individuals with suspected cases of COVID-19 registered in the epidemiological surveillance system between February 1 and June 30, 2021, were studied. RT-qPCR was performed to determine SARS-CoV-2 infection; those with a positive result were considered cases, and those with a negative result were considered controls. The ratio between cases and controls was 1:1.3. The crude and adjusted vaccine effectiveness was considered the prevention of symptomatic infection and death and calculated as the difference between the dose and the risk, with a survival analysis among vaccinated people. RESULTS: A total of 94,416 individuals were included, of whom 40,192 were considered cases and 54,224 controls; 3,781 (4.00%) had been vaccinated against COVID-19. Vaccination also proved to be a protective factor against COVID-19, especially in the population who received a second dose (OR = 0.31; 95% CI 0.28-0.35). With the application of the vaccine, there was a protective effect against mortality (OR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.66-0.87). Disease prevention was higher for the BNT162-2 mRNA vaccine (82%) followed by the ChAdOx1 vaccine (33%). In the survival analysis, vaccination provided a protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: There was a positive impact of vaccines for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19, with a second dose generating greater efficacy and a reduction in deaths."	"1932-6203

vaccination immune response"	"Lung cancer patients represent a subgroup of special vulnerability in whom the SARS-CoV-2 infection could attain higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, those patients were recommended to receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccines once they were approved. However, little was known at that time regarding the degree of immunity developed after vaccination or vaccine-related adverse events, and more uncertainty involved the real need for a third dose. We sought to evaluate the immune response developed after vaccination, as well as the safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in a cohort of patients with lung cancer. Patients were identified through the Oncology/Hematology Outpatient Vaccination Program. Anti-Spike IgG was measured before any vaccine and at 3-6-, 6-9- and 12-15-month time points after the 2nd dose. Detailed clinical data were also collected. In total, 126 patients with lung cancer participated and received at least one dose of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. At 3-6 months after 2nd dose, 99.1% of baseline seronegative patients seroconverted and anti-Spike IgG titers went from a median value of 9.45 to 720 UI/mL. At the 6-9-month time point, titers raised to a median value of 924 UI/mL, and at 12-15 months, after the boost dose, they reached a median value of 3064 UI/mL. Adverse events to the vaccine were mild, and no SARS- CoV-2 infection-related deaths were recorded. In this lung cancer cohort, COVID-19 vaccines were safe and effective irrespective of the systemic anticancer therapy. Most of the patients developed anti-Spike IgG after the second dose, and these titers were maintained over time with low infection and reinfection rates with a mild clinical course."	"2072-6694

The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and outcome of HA COVID-19 in different specialties across the wards in 18 hospitals belonging to the Helsinki University Hospital (HUH) responsible for secondary and tertiary care of a population of 1.8 million. DESIGN: Retrospective population-based cohort study. SETTING: Secondary and tertiary care hospitals. PATIENTS: Inpatients with HA COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The HA COVID-19 infections with patient characteristics were retrospectively searched from HUH patient database from 1st October 2021 to 31st March 2022. All positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) from any ward were reviewed. The COVID-19 infection was classified as HA if a notification of HA infection was done or SARS-CoV-2 NAAT was positive ≥6 days after hospital admission or medical records revealed a known exposure for COVID-19 during hospital stay. RESULTS: 177 HA COVID-19 infections were retrieved with an incidence of 0.55 per 1000 patient days. Of these patients, 71 (40%) were treated in medicine, 52 (29%) in operative, and 54 (31%) in psychiatric wards, leading to incidences of 0.51, 0.39, and 1.10 per 1,000 patient days, respectively. In association with COVID-19, 16 (23%) in medicine, 3 (6%) in operative, and 1 (2%) patient in psychiatric wards deceased. Of the deceased patients, 16 (80%) had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections in omicron era were related to high mortality, especially among patients in medicine wards who also had good vaccination coverage."	"2732-494x

Multicenter study"	"BACKGROUND: Emergency authorization and approval were given for the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) vaccines. The efficacy reported after phase III trials were 70.4% and 78% for Covishield and Covaxin, respectively.In this study, we aim to analyze the risk factors, which were associated with mortality in critically ill COVID-19-vaccinated patients admitted into intensive care unit (ICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted from April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 across five centers in India. Patients who had received either one or two doses of any of the COVID vaccines and developed COVID-19 were included. The ICU mortality was a primary outcome. RESULTS: A total of 174 patients with COVID-19 illness were included in the study. The mean age was 57 years standard deviation (SD 15). Acute physiology, age and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were 14 (8-24.5) and 6 (4-8), respectively. Multiple variable logistic regression showed patients who have received a single dose [odds ratio (OR): 2.89, confidence interval (CI): 1.18, 7.08], neutrophil:lymphocyte (NL) ratio (OR: 1.07, CI: 1.02,1.11), and SOFA score (OR: 1.18, CI: 1.03,1.36) were associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSION: The mortality in the vaccinated patients admitted to the ICU was 43.68% due to COVID illness. The mortality was lower in patients who had received two doses.

Our objective was to conduct a review of published SARS-CoV-2 VE articles, supplemented by preprints, during the first 6 months of COVID-19 vaccine availability. This review compares the effectiveness of completing the primary COVID-19 vaccination series against multiple SARS-CoV-2 disease presentations and disease severity outcomes in three population groups (general population, frontline workers, and older adults). Four hundred and seventy-one published articles and 47 preprints were identified. After title and abstract screening and full article review, 50 studies (28 published articles, 22 preprints) were included. VE results were reported for five COVID-19 vaccines and four combinations of COVID-19 vaccines. VE results for BNT162b2 were reported in 70.6% of all studies. Seventeen studies reported variant specific VE estimates; Alpha was the most common. This comprehensive review demonstrates that COVID-19 vaccination is an important tool for preventing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among fully vaccinated persons aged 16 years and older and serves as an important baseline from which to follow future trends in COVID-19 evolution and effectiveness of new and updated vaccines."

We investigated COVID-19 mortality among people with schizophrenia and other SMIs before, during and after the UK vaccine roll-out. STUDY DESIGN: Using the Greater Manchester (GM) Care Record to access routinely collected health data linked with death records, we plotted COVID-19 mortality rates over time in GM residents with schizophrenia/psychosis, bipolar disorder (BD), and/or recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD) from February 2020 to September 2021. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare mortality risk (risk ratios; RRs) between people with SMI (N = 193 435) and age-sex matched controls (N = 773 734), adjusted for sociodemographic factors, preexisting comorbidities, and vaccination status. STUDY RESULTS: Mortality risks were significantly higher among people with SMI compared with matched controls, particularly among people with schizophrenia/psychosis (RR 3.18, CI 2.94-3.44) and/or BD (RR 2.69, CI 2.16-3.34). In adjusted models, the relative risk of COVID-19 mortality decreased, though remained significantly higher than matched controls for people with schizophrenia (RR 1.61, CI 1.45-1.79) and BD (RR 1.92, CI 1.47-2.50), but not recurrent MDD (RR 1.08, CI 0.99-1.17). People with SMI continued to show higher mortality rate ratios relative to controls throughout 2021, during vaccination roll-out. CONCLUSIONS: People with SMI, notably schizophrenia and BD, were at greater risk of COVID-19 mortality compared to matched controls. Despite population vaccination efforts that have prioritized people with SMI, disparities still remain in COVID-19 mortality for people with SMI."	"1745-1701

The objective was to know the impact of vaccination against COVID-19 on the hospitalization of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospital mortality and readmissions for this cause, and to describe the characteristics of vaccinated patients who required admission. METHODS: A retrospective, observational epidemiological study was conducted of all patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a diagnostic test for active infection (PDIA) in a tertiary hospital, from January 2021 to June 2021. The incidence of admissions was calculated based on the vaccination status of the patients and age groups at different times according to the progress of the strategy of vaccination COVID-19. RESULTS: Between December 27, 2020 and June 30, 2021, 1,308 patients with positive PDIA were admitted to the University Hospital of Salamanca, of which 1,167 (89.2%) were not vaccinated, 129 (9.9%) had received one dose of vaccine and 12 (0.9%) were fully vaccinated. Of the latter, none were admitted to the ICU and 2 died. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination against COVID-19 has contributed to the decrease in hospitalizations, since February 2021, of older and institutionalized people. Fully vaccinated people have a lower risk of admission to the ICU and death. These data, together with the information available on recent cases of new SARS-CoV-2 infections in unvaccinated young people, are in favor of achieving high vaccination coverage of the entire population in the shortest possible time."

This study aims to investigate the effects of state-level predictors that vary month-by-month on changes in vaccination rates. Panel data of state-level indicators are built for all 50 states from April 2021 to January 2022. The dependent variable is the monthly increase in vaccination rate, and the independent variables include measures of Biden's approval, inflation, economic recovery, and COVID-19 mortality for each month of this study period. Fixed-effects regression is adopted for longitudinal statistical estimation. Findings show that over time Biden's approval and COVID-19 death are positively associated with the growth in the vaccination rate, while inflation and economic recovery are negatively associated with the vaccination rate. Significant interactions are identified among these predictors. The findings from analyzing panel indicators at the state level complement the current literature dominated by examining cross-sectional data and provide public health officials with fresh insights to promote the vaccine rollout."

We sought to determine factors associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes among recipients of organ transplants across Canada. METHODS: We performed a multicentre, prospective cohort study of all recipients of solid organ transplants from 9 transplant programs in Canada who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 from March 2020 to November 2021. Data were analyzed to determine risk factors for oxygen requirement and other metrics of disease severity. We compared outcomes by organ transplant type and examined changes in outcomes over time. We performed a multivariable analysis to determine variables associated with need for supplemental oxygen. RESULTS: A total of 509 patients with solid organ transplants had confirmed COVID-19 during the study period. Risk factors associated with needing (n = 190), compared with not needing (n = 319), supplemental oxygen included age (median 62.6 yr, interquartile range [IQR] 52.5-69.5 yr v. median 55.5 yr, IQR 47.5-66.5; p < 0.001) and number of comorbidities (median 3, IQR 2-3 v. median 2, IQR 1-3; p < 0.001), as well as parameters associated with immunosuppression. Recipients of lung transplants (n = 48) were more likely to have severe disease with a high mortality rate (n = 15, 31.3%) compared with recipients of other organ transplants, including kidney (n = 48, 14.8%), heart (n = 1, 4.4%), liver (n = 9, 11.4%) and kidney-pancreas (n = 3, 12.0%) transplants (p = 0.02). Protective factors against needing supplemental oxygen included having had a liver transplant and receiving azathioprine. Having had 2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine did not have an appreciable influence on oxygen requirement. Multivariable analysis showed that older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.07) and number of comorbidities (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.30-2.04), among other factors, were associated with the need for supplemental oxygen. Over time, disease severity did not decline significantly. INTERPRETATION: Despite therapeutic advances and vaccination of recipients of solid organ transplants, evidence of increased severity of COVID-19, in particular among those with lung transplants, supports ongoing public health measures to protect these at-risk people, and early use of COVID-19 therapies for recipients of solid organ transplants."

Vaccination may mitigate this risk; however, immunogenicity appears to be significantly impaired, with reports of increased risk of breakthrough infection. It is unknown if vaccine breakthrough infections are milder or as severe as infections in unvaccinated patients. METHODS: We performed a multicenter matched cohort study between March 2020 and September 2021 to assess influence of COVID-19 vaccination on outcomes of COVID-19 infection. Treatment characteristics and disease severity outcomes were compared on the basis of vaccine status; breakthrough infections versus unvaccinated infections. Variable ratio propensity score matching based on age, sex, transplant type, and number of comorbidities, was used to develop the analytic cohort. Logistic regression was used to assess the influence of vaccination status on the selected outcomes. RESULTS: From a cohort of 511 SOT patients with COVID-19, we matched 77 partially or fully vaccinated patients with 220 unvaccinated patients. Treatment characteristics including use of dexamethasone, remdesivir, and antibiotics did not differ. Vaccinated participants were more likely to receive tocilizumab, 15 of 77 (19.5%) versus 5 of 220 (2.3%), P  < 0.001. Disease severity outcomes including oxygen requirement, mechanical ventilation, and mortality were similar among medically attended vaccine breakthroughs compared with unvaccinated patients. CONCLUSIONS: SOT recipients who develop medically attended COVID-19 following 1- or 2-dose vaccination seem to have similar disease severity to unvaccinated patients who develop infection. This is consistent with the requirement that SOT recipients need 3 or more vaccine doses and emphasizes the importance of alternate strategies for this population."	"1534-6080

Methods A time series model was used to understand the trend of rCFR over time, and a generalized linear mixed model was used to understand the effect of vaccination on rCFR. Results By 31 December 2022, an average of 260.3 doses of COVID-19 vaccine per 100 population had been administered in the top 20 vaccinated countries, compared with 152.1 doses in the rest of the world and 51.2 doses in SSA. The mean rCFR of COVID-19 had decreased by 69.0% in the top 20 vaccinated countries, 26.5% in the rest of the world and 7.6% in SSA. Excess mortality had decreased by 48.7% in the top 20 vaccinated countries, compared with 62.5% in the rest of the world and 60.7% in SSA. In a generalized linear mixed model, the reported number of vaccine doses administered (/100 population) (odds ratio 0.64) was associated with a steeper reduction in COVID-19 rCFR. Conclusions Vaccine equity and faster roll-out across the world is critically important in reducing COVID-19 transmission and CFR."

While questions of vaccine allocation strategies have received significant attention, important questions remain regarding the potential impact of the vaccine given uncertainties regarding efficacy against transmission, availability, timing, and durability. METHODS: We adapted a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model to examine the potential impact on hospitalization and mortality assuming increasing rates of vaccine efficacy, coverage, and administration. We also evaluated the uncertainty of the vaccine to prevent infectiousness as well as the impact on outcomes based on the timing of distribution and the potential effects of waning immunity. FINDINGS: Increased vaccine efficacy against disease reduces hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19; however, the relative benefit of transmission blocking varied depending on the timing of vaccine distribution. Early in an outbreak, a vaccine that reduces transmission will be relatively more effective than one introduced later in the outbreak. In addition, earlier and accelerated implementation of a less effective vaccine is more impactful than later implementation of a more effective vaccine. These findings are magnified when considering the durability of the vaccine. Vaccination in the spring will be less impactful when immunity is less durable. INTERPRETATION: Policy choices regarding non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing and face mask use, will need to remain in place longer if the vaccine is less effective at reducing transmission or distributed slower. In addition, the stage of the local outbreak greatly impacts the overall effectiveness of the vaccine in a region and should be considered when allocating vaccines.

The following systematic review focuses on extrapolating thrombotic risk factors, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of patients diagnosed with TTS following the COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: We utilized the World Health Organization's criteria for a confirmed and probable case of TTS following COVID-19 vaccination and conducted a systematic review and posthoc analysis using the PRISMA 2020 statement. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS V25 for factors associated with mortality, including age, gender, anti-PF4/heparin antibodies, platelet nadir, D-dimer peak, time to event diagnosis, arterial or venous thrombi. RESULTS: Of the 175 studies identified, a total of 25 studies with 69 patients were included in this systematic review and post hoc analysis. Platelet nadir (P < .001), arterial or venous thrombi (χ2 = 41.911, P = .05), and chronic medical conditions (χ2 = 25.507, P = .041) were statistically associated with death. The ROC curve analysis yielded D-dimer (AUC = .646) and platelet nadir (AUC = .604) as excellent models for death prediction. CONCLUSION: Adenoviral COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to trigger TTS, however, reports of patients having received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are also present. Healthcare providers are recommended to maintain a high degree of suspicion among individuals who have received the COVID-19 vaccine within the last 4 weeks."	"1938-2723

The purpose of this study was to look into the efficacy of critical illness and mortality scores, as well as other risk factors in COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred twenty-eight inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. Sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory data were recorded and risk calculations were made with the help of web-based patient data-based calculation programs called COVID-GRAM Critical Illness and 4C-Mortality score. RESULTS: The median age of 228 patients included in the study was 56.5 years, 51.3% of them were males, and ninety-six (42.1%) were unvaccinated. According to the multivariate analysis, the factors affecting the development of critical illness were cough [odds ratio=0.303, 95% CI (0.123,0.749), p=0.010], creatinine [odds ratio=1.542, 95% CI (1.100, 2.161), p=0.012], respiratory rate [odds ratio=1.484, 95% CI (1.302, 1.692), p=0.000], COVID-GRAM Critical Illness Score [odds ratio=3.005, 95% CI (1.288, 7.011), p=0.011]. Factors affecting survival were vaccine status [odds ratio=0.320, 95% CI (0.127,0.802), p=0.015], blood urea nitrogen (BUN) [odds ratio=1.032, 95% CI (1.012, 1.053), p=0.002], respiratory rate [odds ratio=1.173, 95% CI (1.070, 1.285), p=0.001], COVID-GRAM-critical-illness score [odds ratio=2.714, 95% CI (1.123, 6.556), p=0.027]. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggested that risk assessment might employ risk scoring, such as COVID-GRAM Critical Illness, and that immunization against COVID-19 will reduce the occurrence of mortality."

This depletion can potentially hinder the serological response to neoantigens. METHODS: Our objective was to analyze the effect of anti-CD20 maintenance therapy in a reliable model of response to neoantigens: SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses and the incidence/severity ofCOVID-19 in a reference hospital. RESULTS: In our series (n=118), the rate of vaccination failures was 31%. Through ROC curve analysis, we determined a cutoff for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine serologic response at 24 months from the last anti-CD20 dose. The risk of severe COVID-19 was notably higher within the first 24months following the last anti-CD20 dose (52%) compared to after this period (just 18%) (p=0.007). In our survival analysis, neither vaccine response nor hypogammaglobulinemia significantly affected OS. While COVID-19 led to a modest mortality rate of 2.5%, this figure was comparable to the OS reported in the general immunocompetent population. However, most patients with hypogammaglobulinemia received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and all were vaccinated. In conclusion, anti-CD20 maintenance therapy impairs serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. DISCUSSION: We report for the first time that patients during maintenance therapy and up to 24 months after the last anti-CD20 dose are at a higher risk of vaccine failure and more severe cases of COVID-19. Nevertheless, with close monitoring, intravenous immunoglobulin supplementation or proper vaccination, the impact on survival due to the lack of serological response in this high-risk population can be mitigated, allowing for the benefits of anti-CD20 maintenance therapy, even in the presence of hypogammaglobulinemia."

OBJECTIVES: To determine impact of COVID-19 vaccination on mortality following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: This was a single center retrospective observation study among patients with AMI enrolled in the the North India ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NORIN-STEMI) registry. In all the enrolled patients, data regarding patient's vaccination status including details on type of vaccine, date of vaccination and adverse effects were obtained. All enrolled subjects were followed up for a period of six months. The primary outcome of the study was all-cause mortality both at one month and at six months of follow-up. Propensity-weighted score logistic regression model using inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to determine the impact of vaccination status on all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1578 subjects were enrolled in the study of whom 1086(68.8%) were vaccinated against COVID-19 while 492(31.2%) were unvaccinated. Analysis of the temporal trends of occurrence of AMI post vaccination did not show a specific clustering of AMI at any particular time. On 30-day follow-up, all-cause mortality occurred in 201(12.7%) patients with adjusted odds of mortality being significantly lower in vaccinated group (adjusted odds ratio[aOR]: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.47-0.71). Similarly, at six months of follow-up, vaccinated AMI group had lower odds of mortality(aOR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.65) as compared to non-vaccinated group. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccines have shown to decrease all-cause mortality at 30 days and six months following AMI."	"1932-6203

vaccination rate"	"COVID-19 has become a severe infectious disease and has caused high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Restriction rules such as quarantine and city lockdown have been implemented to mitigate the spread of infection, leading to significant economic impacts. Fortunately, development and inoculation of COVID-19 vaccines are being conducted on an unprecedented scale. The effectiveness of vaccines raises a hope that city lockdown might not be necessary in the presence of ongoing vaccination, thereby minimizing economic loss. The question, however, is how fast and what type of vaccines should be inoculated to control the disease without limiting economic activity. Here, we set up a simulation scenario of COVID-19 outbreak in a modest city with a population of 2.5 million. The basic reproduction number (R(0)) was ranging from 1.0 to 5.5. Vaccination rates at 1000/day, 10,000/day and 100,000/day with two types of vaccine (effectiveness v = 51% and 89%) were given. The results indicated that R(0) was a critical factor. Neither high vaccination rate (10,000 persons/day) nor high-end vaccine (v = 89%) could control the disease when the scenario was at R(0) = 5.5. Unless an extremely high vaccination rate was given (>4% of the entire population/per day), no significant difference was found between two types of vaccine. With the population scaled to 25 million, the required vaccination rate was >1,000,000/day, a quite unrealistic number. Nevertheless, with a slight reduction of R(0) from 5 to 3.5, a significant impact of vaccine inoculation on disease control was observed. Thus, our study raised the importance of estimating transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in a city before determining the subsequent policy."	"2227-9032

Vaccination"	"BACKGROUND: Vaccines against coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) have been effective in preventing symptomatic diseases, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. However, data regarding the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in reducing mortality among critically ill patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. AIMS: To determine the vaccination status and investigate the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on the 28-day mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter prospective observational clinical study. METHODS: This study was conducted in 60 hospitals with ICUs managing critically ill patients with COVID-19. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU were included. The present study had two phases. The first phase was designed as a one-day point prevalence study, and demographic and clinical findings were evaluated. In the second phase, the 28-day mortality was evaluated. RESULTS: As of August 11, 2021, 921 patients were enrolled in the study. The mean age of the patients was 65.42 ± 16.74 years, and 48.6% (n = 448) were female. Among the critically ill patients with COVID-19, 52.6% (n = 484) were unvaccinated, 7.7% (n = 71) were incompletely vaccinated, and 39.8% (n = 366) were fully vaccinated. A subgroup analysis of 817 patients who were unvaccinated (n = 484) or who had received two doses of the CoronaVac vaccine (n = 333) was performed. The 28-day mortality rate was 56.8% (n = 275) and 57.4% (n = 191) in the unvaccinated and two-dose CoronaVac groups, respectively. The 28-day mortality was associated with age, hypertension, the number of comorbidities, type of respiratory support, and APACHE II and sequential organ failure assessment scores (p < 0.05). The odds ratio for the 28-day mortality among those who had received two doses of CoronaVac was 0.591 (95% confidence interval: 0.413-0.848) (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Vaccination with at least two doses of CoronaVac within six months significantly decreased mortality in vaccinated patients than in unvaccinated patients."	"2146-3131

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether COVID-19 vaccination is associated with preventing ICU admission for COVID-19 pneumonia and to compare baseline characteristics and outcomes of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients admitted to an ICU. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study on regional data sets reports: (1) daily number of administered vaccines and (2) data of all consecutive patients admitted to an ICU in Lombardy, Italy, from August 1 to December 15, 2021 (Delta variant predominant). Vaccinated patients received either mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) or adenoviral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-S or Ad26.COV2). Incident rate ratios (IRRs) were computed from August 1, 2021, to January 31, 2022; ICU and baseline characteristics and outcomes of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients admitted to an ICU were analyzed from August 1 to December 15, 2021. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 vaccination status (no vaccination, mRNA vaccine, adenoviral vector vaccine). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The incidence IRR of ICU admission was evaluated, comparing vaccinated people with unvaccinated, adjusted for age and sex. The baseline characteristics at ICU admission of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients were investigated. The association between vaccination status at ICU admission and mortality at ICU and hospital discharge were also studied, adjusting for possible confounders. RESULTS: Among the 10 107 674 inhabitants of Lombardy, Italy, at the time of this study, the median [IQR] age was 48 [28-64] years and 5 154 914 (51.0%) were female. Of the 7 863 417 individuals who were vaccinated (median [IQR] age: 53 [33-68] years; 4 010 343 [51.4%] female), 6 251 417 (79.5%) received an mRNA vaccine, 550 439 (7.0%) received an adenoviral vector vaccine, and 1 061 561 (13.5%) received a mix of vaccines and 4 497 875 (57.2%) were boosted. Compared with unvaccinated people, IRR of individuals who received an mRNA vaccine within 120 days from the last dose was 0.03 (95% CI, 0.03-0.04; P < .001), whereas IRR of individuals who received an adenoviral vector vaccine after 120 days was 0.21 (95% CI, 0.19-0.24; P < .001). There were 553 patients admitted to an ICU for COVID-19 pneumonia during the study period: 139 patients (25.1%) were vaccinated and 414 (74.9%) were unvaccinated. Compared with unvaccinated patients, vaccinated patients were older (median [IQR]: 72 [66-76] vs 60 [51-69] years; P < .001), primarily male individuals (110 patients [79.1%] vs 252 patients [60.9%]; P < .001), with more comorbidities (median [IQR]: 2 [1-3] vs 0 [0-1] comorbidities; P < .001) and had higher ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) and fraction of inspiratory oxygen (FiO2) at ICU admission (median [IQR]: 138 [100-180] vs 120 [90-158] mm Hg; P = .007). Factors associated with ICU and hospital mortality were higher age, premorbid heart disease, lower Pao2/FiO2 at ICU admission, and female sex (this factor only for ICU mortality). ICU and hospital mortality were similar between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, mRNA and adenoviral vector vaccines were associated with significantly lower risk of ICU admission for COVID-19 pneumonia. ICU and hospital mortality were not associated with vaccinated status. These findings suggest a substantial reduction of the risk of developing COVID-19-related severe acute respiratory failure requiring ICU admission among vaccinated people."	"2574-3805

Vaccination"	"IMPORTANCE: Although vaccination substantially reduces the risk of severe COVID-19, it is yet unknown whether vaccinated patients who develop COVID-19 and require invasive mechanical ventilation have lower mortality than controls. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between COVID-19 vaccination status and mortality among critically ill patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation owing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study was performed between June 7, 2021, and February 1, 2022, among 265 consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 in academic intensive care units who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation owing to ARDS. EXPOSURES: Patients in the full vaccination group had completed the primary COVID-19 vaccination series more than 14 days but less than 5 months prior to intubation. This time threshold was chosen because guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend a booster dose beyond that time. The remaining patients (ie, those who were unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or fully vaccinated <14 days or >5 months before intubation) comprised the control group. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time from intubation to all-cause intensive care unit mortality. A Cox proportional hazards regression model including vaccination status, age, comorbid conditions, and baseline Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on the day of intubation was used. RESULTS: A total of 265 intubated patients (170 men [64.2%]; median age, 66.0 years [IQR, 58.0-76.0 years]; 26 [9.8%] in the full vaccination group) were included in the study. A total of 20 patients (76.9%) in the full vaccination group received the BNT162b2 vaccine, and the remaining 6 (23.1%) received the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Patients in the full vaccination group were older (median age, 72.5 years [IQR, 62.8-80.0 years] vs 66.0 years [IQR, 57.0-75.0 years]) and more likely to have comorbid conditions (24 of 26 [92.3%] vs 160 of 239 [66.9%]), including malignant neoplasm (6 of 26 [23.1%] vs 18 of 239 [7.5%]), than those in the control group. Full vaccination status was significantly associated with lower mortality compared with controls (16 of 26 patients [61.5%] died in the full vaccination group vs 163 of 239 [68.2%] in the control group; hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.32-0.94]; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, full vaccination status was associated with lower mortality compared with controls, which suggests that vaccination might be beneficial even among patients who were intubated owing to COVID-19-related ARDS. These results may inform discussions with families about prognosis."	"2574-3805

SARS-CoV-2"	"BACKGROUND: Different forms of vaccines have been developed to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 virus and subsequent COVID-19 disease. Several are in widespread use globally.  OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines (as a full primary vaccination series or a booster dose) against SARS-CoV-2. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 L·OVE platform (last search date 5 November 2021). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, regulatory agency websites, and Retraction Watch. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing COVID-19 vaccines to placebo, no vaccine, other active vaccines, or other vaccine schedules. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for all except immunogenicity outcomes.  We synthesized data for each vaccine separately and presented summary effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  MAIN RESULTS: We included and analyzed 41 RCTs assessing 12 different vaccines, including homologous and heterologous vaccine schedules and the effect of booster doses. Thirty-two RCTs were multicentre and five were multinational. The sample sizes of RCTs were 60 to 44,325 participants. Participants were aged: 18 years or older in 36 RCTs; 12 years or older in one RCT; 12 to 17 years in two RCTs; and three to 17 years in two RCTs. Twenty-nine RCTs provided results for individuals aged over 60 years, and three RCTs included immunocompromized patients. No trials included pregnant women. Sixteen RCTs had two-month follow-up or less, 20 RCTs had two to six months, and five RCTs had greater than six to 12 months or less. Eighteen reports were based on preplanned interim analyses. Overall risk of bias was low for all outcomes in eight RCTs, while 33 had concerns for at least one outcome. We identified 343 registered RCTs with results not yet available.  This abstract reports results for the critical outcomes of confirmed symptomatic COVID-19, severe and critical COVID-19, and serious adverse events only for the 10 WHO-approved vaccines. For remaining outcomes and vaccines, see main text. The evidence for mortality was generally sparse and of low or very low certainty for all WHO-approved vaccines, except AD26.COV2.S (Janssen), which probably reduces the risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 RCT, 43,783 participants; high-certainty evidence). Confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 High-certainty evidence found that BNT162b2 (BioNtech/Fosun Pharma/Pfizer), mRNA-1273 (ModernaTx), ChAdOx1 (Oxford/AstraZeneca), Ad26.COV2.S, BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm-Beijing), and BBV152 (Bharat Biotect) reduce the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 compared to placebo (vaccine efficacy (VE): BNT162b2: 97.84%, 95% CI 44.25% to 99.92%; 2 RCTs, 44,077 participants; mRNA-1273: 93.20%, 95% CI 91.06% to 94.83%; 2 RCTs, 31,632 participants; ChAdOx1: 70.23%, 95% CI 62.10% to 76.62%; 2 RCTs, 43,390 participants; Ad26.COV2.S: 66.90%, 95% CI 59.10% to 73.40%; 1 RCT, 39,058 participants; BBIBP-CorV: 78.10%, 95% CI 64.80% to 86.30%; 1 RCT, 25,463 participants; BBV152: 77.80%, 95% CI 65.20% to 86.40%; 1 RCT, 16,973 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence found that NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) probably reduces the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 compared to placebo (VE 82.91%, 95% CI 50.49% to 94.10%; 3 RCTs, 42,175 participants). There is low-certainty evidence for CoronaVac (Sinovac) for this outcome (VE 69.81%, 95% CI 12.27% to 89.61%; 2 RCTs, 19,852 participants). Severe or critical COVID-19 High-certainty evidence found that BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 result in a large reduction in incidence of severe or critical disease due to COVID-19 compared to placebo (VE: BNT162b2: 95.70%, 95% CI 73.90% to 99.90%; 1 RCT, 46,077 participants; mRNA-1273: 98.20%, 95% CI 92.80% to 99.60%; 1 RCT, 28,451 participants; AD26.COV2.S: 76.30%, 95% CI 57.90% to 87.50%; 1 RCT, 39,058 participants; BBV152: 93.40%, 95% CI 57.10% to 99.80%; 1 RCT, 16,976 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence found that NVX-CoV2373 probably reduces the incidence of severe or critical COVID-19 (VE 100.00%, 95% CI 86.99% to 100.00%; 1 RCT, 25,452 participants). Two trials reported high efficacy of CoronaVac for severe or critical disease with wide CIs, but these results could not be pooled. Serious adverse events (SAEs) mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1 (Oxford-AstraZeneca)/SII-ChAdOx1 (Serum Institute of India), Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 probably result in little or no difference in SAEs compared to placebo (RR: mRNA-1273: 0.92, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.08; 2 RCTs, 34,072 participants; ChAdOx1/SII-ChAdOx1: 0.88, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.07; 7 RCTs, 58,182 participants; Ad26.COV2.S: 0.92, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.22; 1 RCT, 43,783 participants); BBV152: 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97; 1 RCT, 25,928 participants). In each of these, the likely absolute difference in effects was fewer than 5/1000 participants. Evidence for SAEs is uncertain for BNT162b2, CoronaVac, BBIBP-CorV, and NVX-CoV2373 compared to placebo (RR: BNT162b2: 1.30, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.07; 2 RCTs, 46,107 participants; CoronaVac: 0.97, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.51; 4 RCTs, 23,139 participants; BBIBP-CorV: 0.76, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.06; 1 RCT, 26,924 participants; NVX-CoV2373: 0.92, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.14; 4 RCTs, 38,802 participants). For the evaluation of heterologous schedules, booster doses, and efficacy against variants of concern, see main text of review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Compared to placebo, most vaccines reduce, or likely reduce, the proportion of participants with confirmed symptomatic COVID-19, and for some, there is high-certainty evidence that they reduce severe or critical disease. There is probably little or no difference between most vaccines and placebo for serious adverse events. Over 300 registered RCTs are evaluating the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, and this review is updated regularly on the COVID-NMA platform (covid-nma.com). Implications for practice Due to the trial exclusions, these results cannot be generalized to pregnant women, individuals with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or immunocompromized people. Most trials had a short follow-up and were conducted before the emergence of variants of concern. Implications for research Future research should evaluate the long-term effect of vaccines, compare different vaccines and vaccine schedules, assess vaccine efficacy and safety in specific populations, and include outcomes such as preventing long COVID-19. Ongoing evaluation of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness against emerging variants of concern is also vital."	"1469-493x

Therefore, observational data on vaccine safety for prenatally exposed newborns are critical to inform recommendations on maternal immunization. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination during pregnancy is associated with adverse neonatal and early infant outcomes among the newborns. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study comprising all singleton live births in March through September 2021, within a large state-mandated health care organization in Israel, followed up until October 31, 2021. EXPOSURE: Maternal BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination during pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk ratios (RR) of preterm birth, small birth weight for gestational age (SGA), congenital malformations, all-cause hospitalizations, and infant death. Stabilized inverse probability weighting was used to adjust for maternal age, timing of conception, parity, socioeconomic status, population subgroup, and maternal influenza immunization status. RESULTS: The cohort included 24 288 eligible newborns (49% female, 96% born at ≥37 weeks' gestation), of whom 16 697 were exposed (n = 2134 and n = 9364 in the first and second trimesters, respectively) to maternal vaccination in utero. Median (IQR) follow-up after birth was 126 days (76-179) among exposed and 152 days (88-209) among unexposed newborns. No substantial differences were observed in preterm birth rates between exposed and unexposed newborns (RR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83-1.10) or SGA (RR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.08). No significant differences were observed in the incidence of all-cause neonatal hospitalizations (RR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88-1.12), postneonatal hospitalizations after birth (RR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.84-1.07), congenital anomalies (RR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.44-1.04), or infant mortality over the study period (RR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.43-1.72). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This large population-based study found no evident differences between newborns of women who received BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination during pregnancy, vs those of women who were not vaccinated, and contributes to current evidence in establishing the safety of prenatal vaccine exposure to the newborns. Interpretation of study findings is limited by the observational design."	"2168-6211

Initially, in the Western world, COVID-19-related mortality was due to illness in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). To manage the COVID-19 crisis in LTCFs in Israel, the Ministry of Health established a task force named "Senior Shield." The task force executed a screening program of weekly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) SARS-CoV-2 tests for LTCF residents and caregivers, and at a later stage, the task force led the Ministry of Health vaccination program at LTCFs. This study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 (Comirnaty) vaccine in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in LTCF residents. METHODS: We designed a nationwide cohort study utilizing data from the Senior Shield task force. Residents had received the vaccines starting December 2020. The study follow-up period was 5 months (ending May 2021). We defined four outcomes: (a) documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined by a positive PCR test, (b) COVID-19 death, defined by a positive PCR test followed by death, (c) all-cause mortality, defined as death regardless of the result of a PCR test, and (d) a composite endpoint which included documented SARS-CoV-2 infection or death, the earliest of both. We used Kaplan-Meier curves with a log-rank comparison and Cox regression with a time-dependent covariate model to estimate adjusted hazard ratios for vaccine effectiveness (VE). The index date was the date of the first vaccine dose. In unvaccinated residents, the index date was the first date of vaccination in their LTCF. RESULTS: A total of 43,596 residents with a mean age of 83 years living in 454 LTCFs were found eligible for this study. Ninety-one percent of the study population received the first vaccine dose (39,482) and 86% received the second vaccine dose (37,656). Estimated VE 28 days after the first vaccine dose (approximately 7 days after the second vaccine dose) was 81.2% for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 85.3% for COVID-related death, 63.7% for all-cause mortality, and 71.1% for the composite endpoint (SARS-CoV-2 infection or death). CONCLUSION: This study shows that the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectively prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related death, and all-cause mortality in LTCF residents. Further research is warranted on the effect of the third vaccine (booster) in this population."	"1423-0003

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether individuals with COVID-19 could have benefited from vaccination against influenza. We hypothesized that the immunity resulting from the previous influenza vaccination would boost part of the immunity against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We performed a population-based cohort study including all patients with COVID-19 with registered entries in the primary health care (PHC) electronic records during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1 to June 30, 2020) in Catalonia, Spain. We compared individuals who took an influenza vaccine before being infected with COVID-19, with those who had not taken one. Data were obtained from Information System for Research in Primary Care, capturing PHC information of 5.8 million people from Catalonia. The main outcomes assessed during follow-up were a diagnosis of pneumonia, hospital admission, and mortality. RESULTS: We included 309,039 individuals with COVID-19 and compared them on the basis of their influenza immunization status, with 114,181 (36.9%) having been vaccinated at least once and 194,858 (63.1%) having never been vaccinated. In total, 21,721 (19%) vaccinated individuals and 11,000 (5.7%) unvaccinated individuals had at least one of their outcomes assessed. Those vaccinated against influenza at any time (odds ratio [OR] 1.14, 95% CI 1.10-1.19), recently (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.10-1.18), or recurrently (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.15) before being infected with COVID-19 had a higher risk of presenting at least one of the outcomes than did unvaccinated individuals. When we excluded people living in long-term care facilities, the results were similar. CONCLUSIONS: We could not establish a protective role of the immunity conferred by the influenza vaccine on the outcomes of COVID-19 infection, as the risk of COVID-19 complications was higher in vaccinated than in unvaccinated individuals. Our results correspond to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, where more complications and mortalities due to COVID-19 had occurred. Despite that, our study adds more evidence for the analysis of a possible link between the quality of immunity and COVID-19 outcomes, particularly in the PHC setting."	"2369-2960

We aimed to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines to prevent mortality and reduce the risk of developing severe disease after the 1st and 2nd doses. From conception to 28 June 2021, we searched PubMed, Cochrane, EBSCO, Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science, WHO-ICTRP, and Google Scholar. We included both observational and randomized controlled trials. The pooled vaccine efficacy and effectiveness following vaccination, as well as their 95 percent confidence intervals (CI), were estimated using the random-effects model. In total, 22 of the 21,567 screened articles were eligible for quantitative analysis. Mortality 7 and 14 days after full vaccination decreased significantly among the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group (OR = 0.10, ([95% CI, 0.04-0.27], I(2) = 54%) and (OR = 0.46, [95% CI, 0.35-0.61], I(2) = 0%), respectively. The probability of having severe disease one or two weeks after 2nd dose decreased significantly (OR = 0.29 [95% CI, 0.19-0.46], I(2) = 25%) and (OR = 0.08 [95% CI, 0.03-0.25], I(2) = 74%), respectively. The incidence of infection any time after the 1st and 2nd doses diminished significantly (OR = 0.14 [95% CI, 0.07-0.4], I(2) = 100%) and (OR = 0.179 [95% CI, 0.15-0.19], I(2) = 98%), respectively. Also, incidence of infection one week after 2nd dose decreased significantly, (OR = 0.04, [95% CI (0.01-0.2], I(2) = 100%). After meta-regression, the type of vaccine and country were the main predictors of outcome [non-mRNA type, ß = 2.99, p = 0.0001; country UK, ß = -0.75, p = 0.038; country USA, ß = 0.8, p = 0.02]. This study showed that most vaccines have comparable effectiveness, and it is purported that mass vaccination may help to end this pandemic."	"2076-393x

Vaccines supplement public health and social measures in preventing severe illness and mortality from COVID-19; however, vaccination rates remain inadequate in many regions. It is important to continuously explore the effective treatment due to the insufficient vaccination rate and increasing number of patients infected with virus. The emergence of new variants has led to multiple surges throughout the world requiring changes to treatment protocols. METHOD: We conducted a single-center observational study on all adult patients who received monoclonal antibody (mAb) infusion as a treatment for COVID-19 infection. Based on the predominant variant, patients were either offered Casirivimab (600 mg)/imdevimab (600 mg) or Sotrovimab (500 mg). Forty-six patients were given mAbs; 24 were vaccinated, and the remaining unvaccinated. RESULT: The mean age was 56 years, and the majority (63.04%) of the patients were female. Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 improved within 3 days of infusion in the majority of the patients (70%). None of the patients who received mAb showed progression of disease or required hospitalization at 30 days follow-up. There were no deaths at 30 days follow-up. Monoclonal antibodies are highly effective in reducing hospitalizations and mortality when given within 7 days of symptoms onset in patients with high-risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19 infection. The mean number of days after the onset at which the mAbs were administered to the patient was 4. CONCLUSION: Monoclonal antibodies should be considered in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 infection if newer antiviral agents are contraindicated. Our study highlights the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody infusions when given early in the course of COVID-19 infection regardless of vaccination status."	"1178-6329

Excess mortality"	"BACKGROUND: Vaccination has played a pivotal role in reducing the burden of COVID-19. Despite numerous studies highlighting its benefits in reducing the risk of severe disease and death, we still lack a quantitative understanding of how varying vaccination roll-out rates influence COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: We developed a framework for estimating the number of avertable COVID-19 deaths (ACDs) by vaccination in Iran. To achieve this, we compared Iran's vaccination roll-out rates with those of eight model countries that predominantly used inactivated virus vaccines. We calculated net differences in the number of fully vaccinated individuals under counterfactual scenarios where Iran's per-capita roll-out rate was replaced with that of the model countries. This, in turn, enabled us to determine age specific ACDs for the Iranian population under counterfactual scenarios where number of COVID-19 deaths are estimated using all-cause mortality data. These estimates covered the period from the start of 2020 to 20 April 2022. RESULTS: We found that while Iran would have had an approximately similar number of fully vaccinated individuals under counterfactual roll-out rates based on Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Turkey (~ 65-70%), adopting Turkey's roll-out rates could have averted 50,000 (95% confidence interval: 38,100-53,500) additional deaths, while following Bangladesh's rates may have resulted in 52,800 (17,400-189,500) more fatalities in Iran. Surprisingly, mimicking Argentina's slower roll-out led to only 12,600 (10,400-13,300) fewer deaths, despite a higher counterfactual percentage of fully vaccinated individuals (~ 79%). Emulating Montenegro or Bolivia, with faster per capita roll-out rates and approximately 50% counterfactual full vaccination, could have prevented more deaths in older age groups, especially during the early waves. Finally, replicating Bahrain's model as an upper-bound benchmark, Iran could have averted 75,300 (56,000-83,000) deaths, primarily in the > 50 age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis revealed that faster roll-outs were consistently associated with higher numbers of averted deaths, even in scenarios with lower overall coverage. This study offers valuable insights into future decision-making regarding infectious disease epidemic management through vaccination strategies. It accomplishes this by comparing various countries' relative performance in terms of timing, pace, and vaccination coverage, ultimately contributing to the prevention of COVID-19-related deaths."

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Pfizer-BioNTech and CoronaVac vaccines against COVID-19 infection, serious illness, and mortality in the geriatric population. We found that 2 doses of CoronaVac vaccine were ineffective in protecting against COVID-19 infection in people over 65 years of age, while the vaccine efficacy (VE) of the mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 was 80% (95% CI 70-87). The VE of full vaccination with BioNTech was 89% (95% CI 53-97) against hospitalization, 79% (95% CI 0-97) against death, and 79% (95% CI 0-97) against intensive care unit (ICU) admission. However, the VE of full vaccination with CoronaVac was 50% (95% CI 33-63) against hospitalization, 53% (95% CI 26-70) against ICU admission, and 56% (95% CI 30-73) against death. In conclusion, we found that the mRNA vaccine has higher efficacy against severe COVID-19 infection and mortality in the geriatric population than the inactivated vaccine. Booster doses of vaccines should be considered in increasing the effectiveness of inactivated vaccines. Given the potential of SARS-CoV-2 mutations evading vaccination protection and the risk of reduced immunity over time, regular monitoring of vaccine effectiveness in the real world is critical."

OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in previously infected persons to that of previously infected persons who subsequently received a single dose of BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study emulating a randomized controlled target trial through a series of nested trials. SETTING: Nationally centralized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services, Israel. PARTICIPANTS: Persons with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection who did not receive subsequent SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were compared with persons with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection who received a single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine at least 3 months after infection. INTERVENTION: Forty-one randomized controlled trials were emulated, in which 107 413 Maccabi Healthcare Services' members aged 16 years and older were eligible for at least 1 trial. MEASUREMENTS: SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes of infection, symptomatic disease, hospitalization, and death, between 2 March and 13 December 2021. RESULTS: A statistically significant decreased risk (hazard ratio, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.20]) for reinfection was found among persons who were previously infected and then vaccinated versus those who were previously infected but remained unvaccinated. In addition, there was a decreased risk for symptomatic disease (hazard ratio, 0.24 [CI, 0.20 to 0.29]) among previously infected and vaccinated persons compared with those who were not vaccinated after infection. No COVID-19-related mortality cases were found. LIMITATION: Hybrid protection against non-Delta variants could not be inferred. CONCLUSION: Persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 gained additional protection against reinfection and COVID-19 from a subsequent single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Nonetheless, even without a subsequent vaccination, reinfection appeared relatively rare. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None."	"1539-3704

METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted among Covid-19 infected hospitalised patients. Clinicodemographic profile, severity, and outcome of Covid-19 infection among the vaccinated group (VG) were recorded. These patients were also compared with unvaccinated group (UVG) with Covid-19 infection admitted during the study period. Cox proportional hazards models was used to estimate hazard ratios for mortality risk in both groups. RESULTS: Out of 580 participants, 48.2% were vaccinated with either one (71%) or two doses (28.9%). In both, VG and UVG, majority 55.8% belonged to 51-75 years. Males were predominant with 62.9% in both VG and UVGs. Day of illness at admission from symptom onset (DOI), progression of disease, ICU stay, oxygen requirement, mortality was significantly higher in UVG than in VG (p < 0.05). Steroid duration (p < 0.001) and anti-coagulation time (p < 0.001) were significantly higher in UVG than in VG. D dimer levels were significantly higher in UVG than in VG (p < 0.05). Increased age, (p < 0.0004), severity of disease, (p < 0.0052), increased oxygen requirement (p < 0.001), elevated C-reactive protein levels (Moderate: P < 0.0013; Severe P < 0.0082), and elevated IL-6 levels (p < 0.001) were the significant determinants of Covid-19-related mortality in both VG and UVGs. CONCLUSION: Vaccinated individuals have shown milder severity, had reduced hospital stay and better outcomes as compared to unvaccinated individuals suggesting a potential vaccine efficacy against Covid-19."

*Vaccination Coverage"	"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 continues to impose significant morbidity and mortality in Japan even after implementing the vaccination program. It would remain elusive if restrictions for its mitigation were to be lifted or relaxed in the future. METHODS: A simulation study that explored possible vaccination coverage scenarios and changes in the intensity of nonpharmaceutical intervention restrictions was performed to assess the impact of COVID-19 based on death count. RESULTS: Assuming the basic reproduction number of circulating viruses was 5.0, vaccines could prevent 90% of infections and 95% of deaths, and the vaccination coverage rate was high (75%, 80%, and 90% in people aged 12-39 years, 40-59 years, ≥60 years, respectively), approximately 50 000 deaths would occur over 150 days in Japan if all restrictions were lifted. Most deaths would occur among older adults, even if their vaccination coverage was assumed to be especially high. A low vaccination coverage scenario (45%, 60%, and 80% in people aged 12-39 years, 40-59 years, ≥60 years, respectively) would require periodic implementation of strict measures even if the modified lifestyle observed in 2020 was sustained and vaccines were very effective. Some restrictions could be relaxed under high vaccination coverage. However, in the worst-case scenario where vaccines had decreased efficacy, as we have observed for the Delta variant, and people lived a relaxed lifestyle, our simulation suggests that even high vaccination coverage would occasionally require strict measures. CONCLUSIONS: We should carefully explore a manageable degree of restrictions and their relaxation. We will have to keep bracing for occasional surges of COVID-19 infection, which could lead to strict measures, such as those under a state of emergency. Such strategies are essential even after a wide rollout of vaccination."	"2047-2986

Vaccine effectiveness"	"OBJECTIVE: This study reports the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of COVID-19 vaccine regimens in the United States, based on the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) database. METHODS: Data from 10.4 million adults, enrolled in the N3C from 11 December 2020 to 30 June 2022, were analyzed. VE against infection and death outcomes were evaluated across 13 vaccine regimens in recipient cohorts during the Pre-Delta, Delta, and Omicron periods. VE was estimated as (1-odds ratio) × 100% by multivariate logistic regression, using the unvaccinated cohort as reference. RESULTS: Natural immunity showed a highly protective effect (70.33%) against re-infection, but the mortality risk among the unvaccinated population was increased after re-infection; vaccination following infection reduced the risk of re-infection and death. mRNA-1273 full vaccination plus mRNA-1273 booster showed the highest anti-infection effectiveness (47.59%) (95% CI, 46.72-48.45) in the overall cohort. In the type 2 diabetes cohort, VE against infection was highest with BNT162b2 full vaccination plus mRNA-1273 booster (61.19%) (95% CI, 53.73-67.75). VE against death was also highest with BNT162b2 full vaccination plus mRNA-1273 booster (89.56%) (95% CI, 85.75-92.61). During the Pre-Delta period, all vaccination regimens showed an anti-infection effect; during the Delta period, only boosters, mixed vaccines, and Ad26.COV2.S vaccination exhibited an anti-infection effect; during the Omicron period, none of the vaccine regimens demonstrated an anti-infection effect. Irrespective of the variant period, even a single dose of mRNA vaccine offered protection against death, thus demonstrating survival benefit, even in the presence of infection or re-infection. Similar patterns were observed in patients with type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Although the anti-infection effect declined as SARS-CoV-2 variants evolved, all COVID-19 mRNA vaccines had sustained effectiveness against death. Vaccination was crucial for preventing re-infection and reducing the risk of death following SARS-CoV-2 infection."	"1873-2518

Vaccination/adverse effects"	"Acquired hemophilia A (AHA), a rare but life-threatening disorder, most commonly occurs in older people and during pregnancy. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination campaign, an unexpected number of newly diagnosed AHA patients have been identified in clinical practice that were temporally related to COVID-19 vaccination. We present the result of a signal detection analysis aimed at exploring a possible association between COVID-19 immunization and occurrence of AHA. A disproportionality analysis on the World Health Organization (WHO) database was performed to investigate the presence of a signal of risk for AHA associated with COVID-19 vaccines. Reports of AHA associated with any COVID-19 vaccine included in the WHO database were then integrated with those available on the Food and Drug Administration Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System and those published in the medical literature. The WHO database included 146 reports of AHA. The information component (IC) was significant for the association of AHA with all COVID-19 vaccines (IC025: 1.1) and with the vaccine product BNT162b2 (IC025: 1.6). After duplicate exclusion, 96 unique cases of AHA following COVID-19 vaccines have been reviewed. Median time to diagnosis was 18 days and 40% of cases documented the occurrence after the second dose. Overall, in 57% of the investigated cases, a preexisting condition predisposing to AHA was excluded. About 22% of cases occurred in subjects with age ≤65 years and there was no case associated with pregnancy. Mortality was 11%. Although we cannot exclude that the unexpected frequency of AHA diagnosis can be explained by a detection bias, the signal for COVID-19 vaccine-related AHA is robust and deserves further investigations."

Among vaccinated patients, 949, 205 and 2 had received a single, two or three vaccine doses, respectively. Most patients (80.3%) had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The SARS-CoV-2 variants infecting vaccinated patients varied over time, reflecting those circulating in the Marseille area, with a predominance of the Marseille-4/20A.EU2 variant from weeks 3 to 6, of the Alpha/20I variant from weeks 7 to 25, and of the Delta/21A variant from week 26. SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly more likely to occur in the first 13 days post-vaccine injection in those who received a single dose (48.9%) than two doses (27.4%, p< 10(-3)). Among 161 patients considered as fully vaccinated, i.e., >14 days after the completion of the vaccinal scheme (one dose for Johnson and Johnson and two doses for Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Sputnik vaccines), 10 (6.2%) required hospitalization and four (2.5%) died. Risks of complications increased with age in a nonlinear pattern, with a first breakpoint at 54, 33, and 53 years for death, transfer to ICU, and hospitalization, respectively. Among patients infected by the Delta/21A or Alpha/20I variants, partial or complete vaccination exhibited a protective effect with a risk divided by 3.1 for mortality in patients ≥ 55 years, by 2.8 for ICU transfer in patients ≥ 34 years, and by 1.8 for hospitalization in patients ≥ 54 years. Compared to partial vaccination, complete vaccination provided an even stronger protective effect, confirming effectiveness to prevent severe forms of COVID-19."	"1664-302x

From January 2021 to July 2022, we extracted all deaths and hospitalizations due to several cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis from National Healthcare System official data. During the follow-up, 5743 individuals died, and 2097 were hospitalized for PVR-SAEs. Vaccinated subjects (n = 259,821) did not show an increased risk of all-cause death, non-COVID death, or any PVR-SAEs, as compared to the unvaccinated (n = 56,494). These results were consistent across genders, age-classes, vaccine types, and SARS-CoV-2 infection status and did not vary in Cox models adjusting for age, gender, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and selected comorbidities. In the infected population, any dose of vaccine was associated with a lower likelihood of death and PVR-SAE. In the uninfected population, subjects who received one or two doses showed a significantly higher incidence of most outcomes, likely due to a large selection bias introduced by the Italian restriction policies targeting uninfected subjects who received less than three doses. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with an increase of mortality or selected PVR-SAEs incidence. Further research is warranted to evaluate the long-term safety of COVID-19 vaccines."	"2076-393x

Like most pandemics caused by viral infections, massive public vaccination is the most promising approach to cease COVID-19 infection. In this regard, several vaccine platforms including inactivated virus, nucleic acid-based (mRNA and DNA vaccines), adenovirus-based, and protein-based vaccines have been designed and developed for COVID-19 prevention and many of them have received FDA or WHO approval. Fortunately, after global vaccination, the transmission rate, disease severity, and mortality rate of COVID-19 infection have diminished significantly. However, a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases due to the omicron variant in vaccinated countries has raised concerns about the effectiveness of these vaccines. In this review, articles published between January 2020 and January 2023 were reviewed using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science search engines with appropriate related keywords. The related papers were selected and discussed in detail. The current review mainly focuses on the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Along with discussing the available and approved vaccines, characteristics of different variants of COVID-19 have also been discussed in brief. Finally, the currently circulating COVID-19 variant i.e Omicron, along with the effectiveness of available COVID-19 vaccines against these new variants are discussed in detail. In conclusion, based on the available data, administration of newly developed bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, as booster shots, would be crucial to prevent further circulation of the newly developed variants."

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: This study was conducted among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: We analysed all hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with available vaccination information captured in Brazil's national electronic respiratory infection data system between 1 January 2020 and 23 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were age-specific mortality rates of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with and without recent inactivated trivalent influenza vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 53 752 clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases were analysed. Controlling for health facility of treatment, comorbidities as well as an extensive range of sociodemographic factors, patients who received a recent influenza vaccine experienced on average 7% lower odds of needing intensive care treatment (95% CI 0.87 to 0.98), 17% lower odds of requiring invasive respiratory support (95% CI 0.77 to 0.88) and 16% lower odds of death (95% CI 0.78 to 0.90). Protective effects were larger when the vaccine was administered after onset of symptoms as well as among younger patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 with recent inactivated influenza vaccination experience significantly better health outcomes than non-vaccinated patients in Brazil. Beneficial off-target effects of influenza vaccination through trained innate immune responses seem plausible and need to be further explored. Large-scale promotion of influenza vaccines seems advisable, especially in populations at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease progression."	"2515-4478

We estimated COVID-19 2-dose primary series and monovalent booster vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron (BA.1 and BA.2) infection among HCWs in 3 Albanian hospitals during January-May 2022. METHODS: Study participants completed weekly symptom questionnaires, underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing when symptomatic, and provided quarterly blood samples for serology. We estimated VE using Cox regression models (1 - hazard ratio), with vaccination status as the time-varying exposure and unvaccinated HCWs as the reference group, adjusting for potential confounders: age, sex, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (detected by PCR, rapid antigen test, or serology), and household size. RESULTS: At the start of the analysis period, 76% of 1462 HCWs had received a primary series, 10% had received a booster dose, and 9% were unvaccinated; 1307 (89%) HCWs had evidence of prior infection. Overall, 86% of primary series and 98% of booster doses received were BNT162b2. The median time interval from the second dose and the booster dose to the start of the analysis period was 289 (interquartile range [IQR], 210-292) days and 30 (IQR, 22-46) days, respectively. VE against symptomatic PCR-confirmed infection was 34% (95% confidence interval [CI], -36% to 68%) for the primary series and 88% (95% CI, 39%-98%) for the booster. CONCLUSIONS: Among Albanian HCWs, most of whom had been previously infected, COVID-19 booster dose offered improved VE during a period of Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 circulation. Our findings support promoting booster dose uptake among Albanian HCWs, which, as of January 2023, was only 20%. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT04811391."	"2328-8957

We investigated the prevalence and severity of COVID-19, as well the effects of COVID-19 vaccination campaign in a large series of SSc patients followed for the entire period (first 38 months) of pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHOD: This prospective survey study included 1755 unselected SSc patients (186 M, 1,569F; mean age 58.7 ± 13.4SD years, mean disease duration 8.8 ± 7.3SD years) recruited in part by telephone survey at 37 referral centers from February 2020 to April 2023. The following parameters were carefully evaluated: i. demographic, clinical, serological, and therapeutical features; ii. prevalence and severity of COVID-19; and iii. safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS: The prevalence of COVID-19 recorded during the whole pandemic was significantly higher compared to Italian general population (47.3 % vs 43.3 %, p < 0.000), as well the COVID-19-related mortality (1.91 % vs 0.72 %, p < 0.001). As regards the putative prognostic factors of worse outcome, COVID-19 positive patients with SSc-related interstitial lung involvement showed significantly higher percentage of COVID-19-related hospitalization compared to those without (5.85 % vs 1.73 %; p < 0.0001), as well as of mortality rate (2.01 % vs 0.4 %; p = 0.002). Over half of patients (56.3 %) received the first two plus one booster dose of vaccine; while a fourth dose was administered to 35.6 %, and only few of them (1.99 %) had five or more doses of vaccine. Of note, an impaired seroconversion was recorded in 25.6 % of individuals after the first 2 doses of vaccine, and in 8.4 % of patients also after the booster dose. Furthermore, the absence of T-cell immunoreactivity was observed in 3/7 patients tested by QuantiFERON® SARSCoV-2 Starter Set (Qiagen). The efficacy of vaccines, evaluated by comparing the COVID-19-related death rate recorded during pre- and post-vaccination pandemic periods, revealed a quite stable outcome in SSc patients (death rate from 2.54 % to 1.76 %; p = ns), despite the significant drop of mortality observed in the Italian general population (from 2.95 % to 0.29 %; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: An increased COVID-19 prevalence and mortality rate was recorded in SSc patients; moreover, the efficacy of vaccines in term of improved outcomes was less evident in SSc compared to Italian general population. This discrepancy might be explained by concomitant adverse prognostic factors: increased rate of non-responders to vaccine in SSc series, low percentage of individuals with four or more doses of vaccine, ongoing immunomodulating treatments, disease-related interstitial lung disease, and/or reduced preventive measures in the second half of pandemic. A careful monitoring of response to COVID-19 vaccines together with adequate preventive/therapeutical strategies are highly recommendable in the near course of pandemic in this frail patients' population."

The objective was to investigate COPD-related mortality throughout different epidemic waves in Italy before and after the vaccination campaign, which started in late December 2020 and initially targeted the population aged ≥80 years. METHODS: Death certificates of residents in Veneto (Northeastern Italy) aged ≥40 years between 2008 and 2021 were analyzed. Age-standardized morality rates were computed for death certificates with any mention of COPD. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were fitted to estimate the expected mortality during the pandemic. The results were stratified by age groups of 40-79 and ≥80 years, main comorbidities, and place of death. RESULTS: COPD was mentioned in 3478 death certificates in 2020 (+14% compared to the 2018-2019 average) and in 3133 in 2021 (+3%). Age-standardized mortality rates increased in all age and sex groups in 2020; in 2021, mortality returned to pre-pandemic levels among the elderly but not in the population aged 40-79 years (+6%). GEE models confirmed this differential trend by age. COPD-related mortality peaks were observed, especially in the first pandemic waves, with COVID-19 identified as the underlying cause of death in a relevant proportion (up to 35% in November 2020-January 2021). Mortality with comorbid diabetes and hypertensive diseases slightly increased during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: COPD-related mortality increased at the beginning of the pandemic, due to deaths from COVID-19. The start of the vaccination campaign was associated with an important decline in COPD-related mortality, especially among the elderly, who first benefited from COVID-19 vaccines. The study findings show the role of mass vaccination in reducing COPD-related deaths during the later phases of the pandemic."	"2076-393x

The aims of this study were to identify the impact of vaccination on the incidence of new daily cases and mortality in the CKD-5D population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective, observational study, involving patients with CKD-5D from 38 NephroCare clinics, Portugal. Daily SARS-CoV-2 infections and mortality among these patients was compared with the incidence in the general population. Three periods were analysed: before vaccination, during the vaccination process, and a third period after complete vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech' Comirnaty® vaccine. The primary outcome was infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the secondary outcome was death associated with the infection. RESULTS: A total of 4617 patients (average of 69.37 years of age) were analysed. During the first period, there was a significantly higher COVID-19 incidence of 14.9% in patients with CKD-5D compared with the general population (7.9%; p < 0.001). During the fifteen days after the complete vaccination, results reverted to a significant decrease in COVID-19 cases was observed (p < 0.001). The mortality rate among CKD-5D was significantly higher than in the general population (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: A high incidence rate of infection was observed in CKD-5D patients, probably due to several factors such as advanced age, number of comorbidities, inability to remain in confinement, among others. After vaccination there was a significant reduction of new cases. CONCLUSION: Vaccination significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with CKD-5D."	"1646-0758

The virus was thought to be contagious, so the government initially severely forced citizens to keep a distance from each other. Since then, several vaccines have been developed that play an important role in controlling mortality. In the case of Covid-19 mortality, the government should be forced to take significant steps in the form of lockdown, keeping you away or forcing citizens to vaccinate. In this paper, modeling of Covid-19 death rates is discussed via probability distributions. To delineate the performance of the best fitted model, the mortality rate of Pakistan and Afghanistan is considered. Numerical results conclude that the NFW model can be used to predict the mortality rate for Covid-19 patients more accurately than other probability models."	"1932-6203

The mechanisms behind the disparity in the severity, vaccine coverage, and variant replacement patterns across European countries are unclear. In this work, we aim to reveal the possible reasons via data visualization and model fitting. We developed a model with a vaccination component to simulate the mortality waves in these countries. Deaths averted by the vaccination campaign were estimated. Finally, we discuss the potential reasons behind the differences in vaccine coverage across European countries. Contemporary transportation and global trade bring significant convenience to our daily life but also facilitate the spread of the novel virus COVID-19 to anywhere globally within a short time. The observations and results in this work highlight the importance of the global campaign to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics under the One Health approach."	"2352-7714

AIM: We investigated the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations and previous SARS-CoV-2 episodes in preventing hospitalization and mortality in NHRs. METHODS: Retrospective study of a cohort of all NHRs in our area who were alive at the start of the vaccination campaign. The first three doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and prior COVID-19 infections were registered. The main outcomes were hospital admission and mortality during each follow up. Random effects time-varying Cox models adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities were fitted to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) according to vaccination status. RESULTS: COVID-19 hospitalization and death rates for unvaccinated NHRs were respectively 2.39 and 1.42 per 10,000 person-days, falling after administration of the second dose (0.37 and 0.34) and rising with the third dose (1.08 and 0.8). Rates were much lower amongst people who had previously had COVID-19. Adjusted HRs indicated a significant decrease in hospital admission amongst those with a two- and three-dose status; those who had had a previous COVID-19 infection had even lower hospital admission rates. Death rates decreased as NHRs received two and three doses, and the probability of death was much lower among those who had previously had the infection. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of current vaccines against severe COVID-19 disease in NHRs remains high and SARS-CoV-2 episodes prior to vaccination entail a major reduction in hospitalization and mortality rates. The protection conferred by vaccines appears to decline in the following months. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04463706."	"1720-8319

To assess the impact of vaccination, we determined the severity of infection in hospitalised patients according to vaccine status. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study on patients hospitalised in 10 centres with a SARS-CoV-2 infection (Delta variant) from July to November 2021 by including all patients who had completed their primary vaccination at least 14 days before hospital admission and the same number of completely unvaccinated patients. We assessed the impact of vaccination and other risk factors through logistic regression. RESULTS: We included 955 patients (474 vaccinated and 481 unvaccinated). Vaccinated patients were significantly older (75.0 [63.25-84.0] vs. 55.0 [38.0-73.0]; p < 0.001), more frequently males (55.1% (261/474) vs. 46.4% (223/481); p = 0.009), and had more comorbidities (2.0 [1.0-3.0] vs. 1.0 [0.0-2.0]; p < 0.001). Vaccinated patients were less often admitted for Covid-19 (59.3% (281/474) vs. 75.1% (361/481); p < 0.001), had less extended lung lesions (≤25%: 64.3% (117/182) vs. 38.4% (88/229); p < 0.001), required oxygen less frequently (57.5% (229/398) vs. 73.0% (270/370); p < 0.001), at a lower flow (3.0 [0.0-8.7] vs. 6.0 [2.0-50.0] L/min, p < 0.001), and for a shorter duration (3 [0.0-8.0] vs. 6 [2.0-12.0] days, p < 0.001)., and required less frequently intensive care unit admission (16.2% (60/370) vs. 36.0% (133/369); p < 0.001) but had comparable mortality in bivariate analysis (16.7% (74/443) vs. 12.2% (53/433); p = 0.075). Multivariate logistic regression showed that vaccination significantly decreased the risk of death (0.38 [0.20-0.70](p = 0.002), ICU admission (0.31 [0.21-0.47](p < 0.001) and oxygen requirement (0.16 [0.10-0.26](p < 0.001), even among older patients or with comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalised with a delta variant SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination was associated with less severe forms, even in the presence of comorbidities."	"1469-0691

Hopefully, recent reports of effective and safe vaccines were welcomed, and approved on emergency base. Millions of recipients had received one of the approved COVID 19 vaccines, with lots of adverse events recorded global wide. OBJECTIVE: To assess post-COVID vaccination immune-mediated adverse events and evaluate its association to specific type of vaccine global wide. METHODS: Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of published reports (since December 2020 till December 2021) on immune-mediated adverse events post-COVID vaccination. RESULTS: We evaluated 34 published studies; 460 cases with various adverse events post-COVID vaccination. Studies in current literature are primarily retrospective case series, isolated case reports or narrative studies. Different COVID vaccines were involved. Results' data was subcategorized according to associated vaccine. Adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations included thrombotic, neurological, myocarditis, ocular, dermatological, renal, hematological events timely linked to inoculation. Each vaccine type was linked to adverse profile that differ from others. CONCLUSION: High suspicion of post-vaccination adverse events is mandatory to provoke earlier detection, better understanding, optimum prevention, and management. Specific vaccine/patient risk profile is needed to selectively categorize target population to reduce morbidity and mortality post-vaccination."	"2090-9098

Vaccination"	"OBJECTIVES: On 11 March, WHO declared a global pandemic caused by a new virus of the family Coronaviridae that has since been called SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 does not have specific antiviral drug treatment currently. There are currently more than one hundred research projects into vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, and 17 of them are already being tested on humans, according to the WHO. Until we have an effective vaccine, the possible preventive effect of flu vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on cross-reactivity has been postulated.Our objective was to analyse the effect of vaccination against flu virus in the season prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in our hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV2 infection. We analysed the differences between patients who had received or had not the flu vaccination for the 2019-2020 season. RESULTS: We found no significant differences (p = 0.09) in patients who died (43 in total), of whom 23 (21.5%) were vaccinated against the flu and 20 (13.5%) were not. In mortality, we obtained an adjusted OR = 0.873 (95% CI: 0.294-2.083), and about the success of health care the adjusted OR was 1.447 (95% CI: 0.610-3.430). CONCLUSIONS: Flu vaccination in patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection had neither a beneficial nor a harmful effect on the clinical courses or outcomes of patients admitted to an European hospital."

To compare the outcomes of COVID-19 positive vaccinated and unvaccinated stroke patients. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective study of COVID-19-vaccinated and unvaccinated stroke patients between April 2020 and March 2022. All patients presenting with stroke regardless of treatment modalities were included. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was used to assess stroke severity. The primary outcome was functional capacity of the patients at discharge. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 203 COVID-19 positive stroke patients divided into 139 unvaccinated and 64 fully vaccinated patients. At discharge, the modified Rankin scale score was significantly lower in the vaccinated cohort (3[1-4] vs. 4[2-5], odds ratio = 0.508, P = 0.011). At 3 months of follow-up, the median modified Rankin scale score was comparable between both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Although vaccination did not show any significant difference in stroke patient outcomes on follow-up, vaccines were associated with lower rates of morbidity and mortality at discharge among stroke patients during the pandemic."

We evaluated the outcome of COVID-19 in AIH patients who received at least one dose of Pfizer- BioNTech (BNT162b2), Moderna (mRNA-1273) or AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1-S) vaccine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on AIH patients with COVID-19. The outcomes of AIH patients who had acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) breakthrough infection after at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine were compared to unvaccinated patients with AIH. COVID-19 outcome was classified according to clinical state during the disease course as: (i) no hospitalization, (ii) hospitalization without oxygen supplementation, (iii) hospitalization with oxygen supplementation by nasal cannula or mask, (iv) intensive care unit (ICU) admission with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, (v) ICU admission with invasive mechanical ventilation or (vi) death, and data was analyzed using ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: We included 413 (258 unvaccinated and 155 vaccinated) patients (81%, female) with a median age of 52 (range: 17-85) years at COVID-19 diagnosis. The rates of hospitalization were (36.4% vs. 14.2%), need for any supplemental oxygen (29.5% vs. 9%) and mortality (7% vs. 0.6%) in unvaccinated and vaccinated AIH patients with COVID-19. Having received at least one dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was associated with a significantly lower risk of worse COVID-19 severity, after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities and presence of cirrhosis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10-0.31). Overall, vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality from COVID-19 (aOR 0.20, 95% CI 0.11-0.35). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination significantly reduced the risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality in patients with AIH."	"1095-9157

We searched the Cochrane Library COVID-19 study register, the COVID-NMA living review database and the McMaster University Living Evidence Synthesis for pre-appraised trials and observational studies up to 7 December 2022. Records were screened independently in duplicate. Where appraisal was not available, these were done in duplicate. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 presenting risk ratios/odds ratios/inverse vaccine efficacy with 95% confidence intervals (CI). GRADE for assessing the overall certainty of the evidence was done in Gradepro. We screened 403 records and assessed 52 full-text articles for eligibility. One randomised controlled trial (RCT) and 24 observational studies were included. The RCT reported that BNT162b2 was likely safe and 91% efficacious, RR 0.09 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.32) against incident COVID-19 infection (moderate certainty evidence). In absolute terms, this is 19 fewer cases per 1,000 vaccines delivered (ranging from 15 to 21 fewer cases). Observational studies reported vaccine effectiveness (VE) against incident COVID-19 infection of 65% (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.47) and 76% against hospitalisation (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.42) (moderate certainty evidence). The absolute effect is 167 fewer cases per 1,000 vaccines given (ranging from 130 fewer to 196 fewer cases) and 4 fewer hospitalisations per 10,000 children (from 3 fewer to 5 fewer hospitalisations). Adverse events following vaccination with BNT162b2 were mild or moderate and transient. The evidence demonstrated a reduction in incident COVID-19 cases and small absolute reduction in hospitalisation if a two-dose BNT162b2 vaccine regimen is offered to children aged 5 to 11 years, compared to placebo.

vaccine equity"	"INTRODUCTION: A majority of low-income (LIC) and lower-middle-income countries (LMIC) were unable to achieve at least 10% population coverage during initial vaccine rollouts, despite the rapid development of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. Nearly three years into this pandemic, evaluating the impact of inequities in vaccine access, uptake, and availability is long overdue. We hypothesized that a delay in receiving COVID-19 vaccines was associated with an increased toll on cumulative cases and mortality. Furthermore, this relationship was modified by the size of a country's economy. METHODS: We performed an ecological study assessing these relationships, in which a country's economic standing was assessed by world bank income classification, gross domestic product based on the purchasing power parity (GDP PPP) per capita category, and crude GDP PPP. RESULTS: Countries with the smallest economies reported first vaccination much later than larger economies on all three rankings, as much as 100 days longer. Among low-income countries, a one-day increase until the first vaccination was associated with a 1.92% (95% CI: 0.100, 3.87) increase in cumulative cases when compared to high-income countries (p = 0.0395) when adjusting for population size, median age, and testing data availability. Similarly, among the lowest GDP PPP countries a one-day increase until the first vaccination was associated with a 2.73% (95% CI: 0.100, 5.44) increase in cumulative cases when compared to the highest GDP PPP countries (p = 0.0415). When modeling cumulative mortality, effects in the same direction and magnitude were observed, albeit statistically non-significant. CONCLUSION: Economic standing modified the effects of delayed access to COVID-19 vaccination on cumulative cases and mortality, in which LMICs tended to fare worse in outcomes than high-income countries despite the eventual rollout of vaccines. These findings highlight the importance of prioritizing equitable and timely access to COVID-19 vaccines across all countries, irrespective of economic size. Future studies should examine the impacts that vaccine inequities had on local transmission dynamics."	"2296-2565

vaccine effectiveness"	"Patients with cirrhosis are vulnerable to hepatic decompensation events and death following COVID-19 infection. Therefore, primary vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines is fundamental to reducing the risk of COVID-19 related deaths in patients with cirrhosis. However, limited data are available about the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines compared to other vaccines. The aim of our study was to investigate the efficacy of mRNA vaccines versus other vaccines in cirrhosis. In this retrospective study, we compared clinical characteristics and vaccine effectiveness of 399 COVID-19 patients without cirrhosis (GROUP A) to 52 COVID-19 patients with cirrhosis (GROUP B). 54 hospitalised cirrhosis controls without COVID-19 (GROUP C) were randomly sampled 1:1 and matched by gender and age. Of the cirrhosis cases, we found no difference (p = 0.76) in mortality rates in controls without COVID-19 (11.8%) compared to those with COVID-19 (9.6%). However, COVID-19 patients with cirrhosis were associated with higher rates of worsening hepatic encephalopathy, ascites and esophageal varices. Patients with cirrhosis receiving mRNA vaccines had significantly better survival rates compared to viral vector or inactivated vaccines. Primary vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine was the most effective in preventing acute hepatic decompensating events, COVID-19 infection requiring hospital admission and in-hospital mortality."

Monoclonal antibodies"	"BACKGROUND: Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are highly effective in reducing hospitalization and mortality among early symptomatic COVID-19 patients in clinical trials and real-world data. While resistance to some mAbs has since emerged among new variants, characteristics associated with treatment failure of mAbs remain unknown. METHODS: This multicenter, observational cohort study included patients with COVID-19 who received mAb treatment between November 20, 2020, and December 9, 2021. We utilized electronic health records from a statewide health system plus state-level vaccine and mortality data. The primary outcome was mAb treatment failure, defined as hospitalization or death within 28 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: COVID-19 mAb was administered to 7406 patients. Hospitalization within 28 days of positive SARS-CoV-2 test occurred in 258 (3.5%) of all patients who received mAb treatment. Ten patients (0.1%) died within 28 days, and all but one were hospitalized prior to death. Characteristics associated with treatment failure included having two or more comorbidities excluding obesity and immunocompromised status (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.52-5.56), lack of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (OR 2.73, 95% CI 2.01-3.77), non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.20-3.82), obesity (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.36-2.34), one comorbidity (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.11-2.57), age ≥ 65 years (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.13-2.35), and male sex (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21-2.02). Immunocompromised status (none, mild, or moderate/severe), pandemic phase, and type of mAb received were not associated with treatment failure (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities, lack of prior SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, obesity, age ≥ 65 years, and male sex are associated with treatment failure of mAbs."	"1471-2334

It is, therefore, important to study the safety of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and to assess the risk of COVID-19 in MG patients. The safety of the three-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and outcomes of COVID-19 during the alpha, delta, and omicron waves were studied in MG patients as well as the rate of exacerbations and safety for a period of up to 6 weeks from each vaccine dose and patient morbidity and mortality during COVID-19 compared to the general population. 430 vaccine doses were administered across 150 patients. Thirteen patients (8.7%) complained of exacerbation within 6 weeks of each vaccine dose. Both MG onset rate and exacerbation rate were similar to previous years. MG exacerbation rate among fifteen patients who had COVID-19 was significantly higher (40%) compared to the rate following vaccination. During the alpha and delta waves, COVID-19 mortality and severe disease were significantly higher (26.7%) compared to the general population (0.96%). All of them were unvaccinated and had generalized MG. During the omicron wave, all the MG patients who contracted COVID-19 were vaccinated and had mild disease. We concluded that COVID-19 is hazardous for generalized MG patients, while the vaccination did not raise the risk for either exacerbation or new onset of MG and was associated with a reduced risk for severe COVID-19. Hence, it is recommended for generalized MG patients to get vaccinated."	"1432-1459

Age at COVID-19 death has been lower in Mexico than in high-income countries, presumably because of the young demographics and high prevalence of chronic metabolic diseases in young and middle-aged adults. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination covered 85% of adults with at least one dose and 50% with booster(s) up to April 2022. No new vaccination efforts or updated boosters were introduced until October 2023; thus, we explored the public health impact of massive SARS-CoV-2 vaccination against ancestral strains and asked whether their real-world protection has persisted through time. We compared three periods with respect to vaccine roll-outs: before, during and after vaccine introduction in a national retrospective cohort of >7.5 million COVID-19 cases. The main findings were that after vaccination, COVID-19 mortality decreased, age at COVID-19 death increased by 5-10 years, both in populations with and without comorbidities; obesity stopped being a significant risk factor for COVID-19 death and protection against severe disease persisted for a year after boosters, including at ages 60-79 and 80+. Middle-aged adults had the highest protection from vaccines/hybrid immunity and they more than halved their proportions in COVID-19 deaths."	"2076-393x

In this scenario of high SARS-CoV-2 circulation, we analyzed the effectiveness of the country's vaccination strategy that used 7 different vaccines from around the world, and focused on vaccinating the oldest population first. We analyzed the national dataset published by Mexican health authorities, as a retrospective cohort, separating cases, hospitalizations, deaths and excess deaths by wave and age group. We explored if the vaccination strategy was effective to limit severe COVID-19 during the active outbreaks caused by Delta and Omicron variants. Vaccination of the eldest third of the population reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations, deaths and excess deaths by 46-55% in the third wave driven by Delta SARS-CoV-2. These adverse outcomes dropped 74-85% by the fourth wave driven by Omicron, when all adults had access to vaccines. Vaccine access for the pregnant resulted in 85-90% decrease in COVID-19 fatalities in pregnant individuals and 80% decrease in infants 0 years old by the Omicron wave. In contrast, in the rest of the pediatric population that did not access vaccination before the period analyzed, COVID-19 hospitalizations increased >40% during the Delta and Omicron waves. Our analysis suggests that the vaccination strategy in Mexico has been successful to limit population mortality and decrease severe COVID-19, but children in Mexico still need access to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to limit severe COVID-19, in particular those 1-4 years old."

The secondary aim was to define the differences between vaccinated and un-vaccinated patients in terms of age, comorbidities and course of the disease, and to determine the survival rates. Of the 1463 PCR-positive patients, 55.3 % were vaccinated, and 44.7 % were unvaccinated. While 959 patients had mild-moderate symptoms, 504 patients had severe-critical symptoms and were treated in the intensive care unit. There was a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the type and doses of vaccines between the patient groups (p = 0.021). The rate of receiving 2 doses of Biontech was 18.9 % in the mild-moderate patient group but lower in the severe patient group (12.6 %). The rate of two doses of Sinovac and two doses of Biontech vaccine (four doses of vaccine) was 5 % in the mild-moderate patient group and 1.9 % in the severe patient group. The mortality rates were statistically significantly different (p < 0.001) between the patient groups: 65.3 % in the severe patient group and 1 % in the mild-moderate patient group. The multivariate model showed that the mortality risk of the unvaccinated patients was 1.5 times higher than the vaccinated ones (p = 0.042). In addition to being unvaccinated, advanced age, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and obesity were found to be associated with higher mortality risk. Besides, the reduction in mortality rate was more evident in individuals vaccinated with at least 2 doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine than in CoronaVac group."	"1846-9558

Real-world data"	"OBJECTIVES: This nationwide, multicentric, retrospective analysis of 1,126,946 COVID-19 cases (March 2020 to June 2022) aims to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on mortality in patients with a sole solid malignancy. METHODS: Using data from the national digital medical record repository, outcomes were compared among fully vaccinated and non-vaccinated cohorts, factoring in gender, virus type, age, vaccination status, vaccine type, and cancer type. Logistic regression calculated odds ratios and their significance. RESULTS: Among 6,050 patients with both cancer and comorbidities, 1,797 had only solid malignancy. Vaccinated individuals in this group had reduced mortality rates, especially those >63 years [OR 0.169 (95%CI 0.090 to 0.317); P < 0.001]. Lower deaths were observed in non-ICU [OR 0.193 (95% CI 0.097 to 0.382); P < 0.001] and ICU cases [OR 0.224 (95% CI 0.077 to 0.646); P = 0.003], with both vaccine types. No statistically significant benefits were observed against delta and omicron variants. Intrathoracic malignancies [OR 0.376 (95%CI 0.146 to 0.971); P = 0.043] and palliative treatment [OR 0.384 (95%CI 0.192 to 0.766); P = 0.006] showed vaccination benefits. Logistic regression revealed a higher fatal risk in non-vaccinated males >63. Propensity score matching supported these outcomes. CONCLUSION: Patients with sole solid malignancies face elevated COVID-19 mortality risk, particularly without active cytostatic therapy, with advanced disease on palliative treatment, or intrathoracic malignancies."

The aim of this study is to assess the temporal trends in protection against mortality. METHODS: Population-based case-control study nested in the total population of Scania Region, Sweden using individual-level registry data of COVID-19-related deaths (<30 days after positive SARS-CoV-2 test) between 27 December 2020 and 3 June 2022. Controls were matched for age, sex, and index date. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the preventable fraction (PF) from vaccination (PF(vac) corresponding to vaccine effectiveness; ≥2 vaccine doses vs. 0 doses), prior infection (PF(inf)), and hybrid immunity (PF(hybrid)). PF was calculated as one minus odds ratio. Models were adjusted for comorbidities, long-term care facility residence, prior infection (for PF(vac)), country of birth, socio-economic conditions, and time since last vaccination (for PF(inf)). RESULTS: In total, 14 936 individuals (1440 COVID-19-related deaths and 13 496 controls) were included in the case-control analyses (45% females, median age: 84 years). PF(vac) was above 90% during the first month after vaccination, regardless of the number of vaccine doses. After 6 months, PF(vac) of two doses waned to 34% (95% CI: -30% to 66%). PF(inf) for people surviving a SARS-CoV-2 infection waned from 88% (-16% to 99%) 3 months after infection to 62% (34-79%) after 9 months. No differences in waning patterns in PF(vac) were seen between virus variants, gender, and age. DISCUSSION: Given the waning of protection against death, continuous surveillance of population immunity status, particularly among the most vulnerable population groups, could help to further fine-tune vaccination recommendations."

Median age of included patients was 84 years, 61.2% were over 80 years; 50.6% were male and most (82.5%) has at least one comorbidity. Up to 84% received specific treatment against COVID-19, including 76.9% low-flow oxygen therapy. We found that overall mortality was 25.6% and 30.6% in those older than 80 years. A higher mortality was significantly associated with older age and treatment with tocilizumab. Our data showed that although COVID-19 vaccines continue protecting elderly patients against hospitalization and death and might improve the prognosis after hospitalization in patients with breakthrough infections, mortality in this population -especially in those older than 80 years- remains very high."

DESIGN: A retrospective observational study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital in western Indian, from April 1 to June 30, 2021. RESULTS: Of the 569 patients who fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were enrolled in the study, 137 (24.08%) patients had received a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, while 432 (75.92%) patients had not received any form of vaccination. The overall length of stay in hospital was similar for both groups; however, a significant difference was seen in length of stay in the ward and in the ICU. Vaccinated patients were admitted to the ward for 6.21 ± 3.204 days, while non-vaccinated patients were admitted for 5.56 ± 4.55 days (p < 0.001). The mean length of ICU stay for the 21 vaccinated patients requiring intensive care was 4.47 ± 2.3 days, while that for the 145 non-vaccinated patients was 6.29 ± 2.19 days (p < 0.001). Mortality was observed in four patients in the vaccinated group and in 95 patients in the non-vaccinated group. CONCLUSION: A single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was associated with a significantly lower severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with no vaccination."	"1878-3511

The primary aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine based on number of administered doses in patients with IBD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using TriNetX, a multi-institutional database to compare patients with IBD who received 1, 2, or 3 doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 to unvaccinated IBD patients (1.1.2020-7.26.2022) to assess the risk of COVID-19 after 1:1 propensity score matching. We also evaluated the impact of vaccine on a composite of severe COVID-19 outcomes including hospitalization, intubation, intensive care unit care, acute kidney injury, or mortality. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, vaccinated patients with 2 (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-0.9) and 3 doses (aOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9) were found to have a lower risk of COVID-19 compared with unvaccinated patients. Vaccinated patients with IBD had a lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes (aOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9) compared with unvaccinated patients. There was no difference in the risk of COVID-19 in IBD patients with 2 compared with 3 doses (aOR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.7-1.3). However, IBD patients with 2 doses were at an increased risk for hospitalization due to COVID-19 (aOR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.02-3.11) compared with those that received 3 doses. CONCLUSION: Vaccinated patients with IBD had a lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes compared with unvaccinated patients. A third dose of COVID-19 vaccine compared with 2 doses decreases the risk of hospitalization but not breakthrough infection in patients with IBD."	"1536-4844

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) vaccination campaign on COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions, and deaths among residents living in Belgian NHs. All 1545 Belgian NHs were invited to participate in a COVID-19 surveillance program. In Belgium, before vaccination, COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates were driven by the situation in the NHs. Shortly after the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, and later the booster campaign, the number of hospital admissions and deaths among NH residents dropped, while clear peaks could be observed among the general population. The impact of vaccination on virus circulation was less effective than expected. However, due to the high vaccination coverage, NH residents remain well protected against hospital admission and death due to COVID-19 more than one year after being vaccinated."	"1999-4915

Vaccine effectiveness"	"INTRODUCTION: The remarkable efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines have been described in healthy individuals, but kidney transplant recipients have been excluded from these studies. Therefore, real-world evidence of these vaccines can guide clinicians in predicting complications in kidney transplant recipients and how many doses of vaccines are protective. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 vaccines on kidney transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This matched case-control study included vaccinated kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 from two centers between 1 May and 1 October 2021. All patients in the vaccinated group received a minimum of two doses of the vaccine and were diagnosed with COVID-19 at least one month after the last dose. Each vaccinated patient was matched with an unvaccinated kidney transplant recipient diagnosed with COVID. The endpoints were all-cause mortality, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, acute kidney injury, cytokine storm, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. RESULTS: The median age of vaccinated seventy-two participants was 45 years, and 41 of the participants were men in the vaccinated group. Four patients in the vaccinated group and nine patients in the control group died during follow-up (p = 0.247). Seventeen patients in the vaccinated group, thirty-four participants in the control group were hospitalized (p = 0.004); five vaccinated patients and ten unvaccinated patients were followed-up in the ICU during follow-up (p = 0.168). Thirteen of the vaccinated and twelve unvaccinated patients developed acute kidney injury (p = 0.16). The occurrence of cytokine storm (n = 4 vs. n = 11; p = 0.061) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 5 vs. n = 10; p = 0.168) was higher in the patient group compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 remains a fatal disease despite advancing treatment modalities and preventive strategies. COVID-19 vaccines can't prevent death in all kidney transplant recipients, but they decrease hospitalization rate and duration in most patients."	"1873-2518

The efficacy of vaccines is affected by the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 variants. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the relationship of vaccination and virus variant on the course of the disease in patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective, cohort study SETTING: Tertiary health institution PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included patients older than the age of 18 years who were hospitalized in a COVID-19 service or the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between 1 January 2021 and 30 April 2021. Demographic characteristics, vaccination and the Alpha virus variant status, comorbidities, and information about hospitalization were obtained from the hospital automation system and patient files. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vaccination rate and relationship with course of disease. SAMPLE SIZE: 608 RESULTS: Most of the patients (n=482, 79.3%) were admitted to the COVID-19 service. More of the COVID-19 service patients had the Alpha variant than the patients admitted to ICU (P<.009). The Alpha variant was also more common in younger patients (P<.001). There was no relationship between the Alpha virus and comorbid diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Mortality was lower in the patients who had received a second dose of the Sinovac vaccine (P=.004) compared with unvaccinated patients. CONCLUSION: Although the Alpha variant spreads faster, it has a milder course. If only the Sinovac vaccine is available, we recommend that the two doses of the Sinovac vaccine be administered. LIMITATIONS: Our study is single-center and did not include pregnant and pediatric patients. CONFLICT OF INTEREST: None."	"0975-4466

*SARS-CoV-2/genetics"	"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron is considered to be less severe than infection with variant Delta, with rarer occurrence of severe disease requiring intensive care. Little information is available on comorbid factors, clinical conditions and specific viral mutational patterns associated with the severity of variant Omicron infection. In this multicenter prospective cohort study, patients consecutively admitted for severe COVID-19 in 20 intensive care units in France between December 7th 2021 and May 1st 2022 were included. Among 259 patients, we show that the clinical phenotype of patients infected with variant Omicron (n = 148) is different from that in those infected with variant Delta (n = 111). We observe no significant relationship between Delta and Omicron variant lineages/sublineages and 28-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.68 [0.35-1.32]; p = 0.253). Among Omicron-infected patients, 43.2% are immunocompromised, most of whom have received two doses of vaccine or more (85.9%) but display a poor humoral response to vaccination. The mortality rate of immunocompromised patients infected with variant Omicron is significantly higher than that of non-immunocompromised patients (46.9% vs 26.2%; p = 0.009). In patients infected with variant Omicron, there is no association between specific sublineages (BA.1/BA.1.1 (n = 109) and BA.2 (n = 21)) or any viral genome polymorphisms/mutational profile and 28-day mortality."

Vaccination"	"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has become the worst pandemic in at least a century. To fight this disease, a global effort led to the development of several vaccines at an unprecedented rate. There have been, however, several logistic issues with its deployment, from their production and transport, to the hesitancy of the population to be vaccinated. For different reasons, an important amount of individuals is reluctant to get the vaccine, something that hinders our ability to control and-eventually-eradicate the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our aim is to explore the impact of vaccine hesitancy when highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern spread through a partially vaccinated population. To do so, we use age-stratified data from surveys on vaccination acceptance, together with age-contact matrices to inform an age-structured SIR model set in the US. RESULTS: Our results show that per every one percent decrease in vaccine hesitancy up to 45 deaths per million inhabitants could be averted. A closer inspection of the stratified infection rates also reveals the important role played by the youngest groups. The model captures the general trends of the Delta wave spreading in the US (July-October 2021) with a correlation coefficient of [Formula: see text]. CONCLUSIONS: Our results shed light on the role that hesitancy plays on COVID-19 mortality and highlight the importance of increasing vaccine uptake in the population, specially among the eldest age groups."

METHODS: National registries of causes of death, COVID-19 vaccination, specialized health care and long-term care reimbursements were linked by a unique person identifier using data from 1 January 2021 to 31 January 2022. We used Cox regression with calendar time as underlying time scale to, firstly, estimate VE against COVID-19 mortality after primary and first booster vaccination, per month since vaccination and, secondly, estimate risk of non-COVID-19 mortality in the 5 or 8 weeks following a first, second or first booster dose, adjusting for birth year, sex, medical risk group and country of origin. RESULTS: VE against COVID-19 mortality was > 90 % for all age groups two months after completion of the primary series. VE gradually decreased thereafter, to around 80 % at 7-8 months post-primary series for most groups, and around 60 % for elderly receiving a high level of long-term care and for people aged 90+ years. Following a first booster dose, the VE increased to > 85 % in all groups. The risk of non-COVID-19 mortality was lower or similar in the 5 or 8 weeks following a first dose compared to no vaccination, as well as following a second dose compared to one dose and a booster compared to two doses, for all age and long-term care groups. CONCLUSION: At the population level, COVID-19 vaccination greatly reduced the risk of COVID-19 mortality and no increased risk of death from other causes was observed."	"1873-2518

Pregnant and postpartum women constitute a high-risk group for severe COVID-19. Vaccination reduces the risk of infection, but it is not known whether women who become infected despite vaccination have a milder course of disease than those who had not been vaccinated. This retrospective cohort study evaluated whether vaccination reduces the severity of COVID-19 infection, as measured by severe maternal morbidity and mortality among hospitalized pregnant and postpartum individuals. A total of 2284 pregnant and postpartum women hospitalized with severe COVID-19 were included. Those who did and who did not receive COVID-19 vaccination were compared. The rates of intensive care unit admission, intubation, and mortality were significantly lower among subjects in the vaccinated group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). The numbers of patients who needed to be vaccinated to avoid one case of intensive care unit admission, intubation, or death due to COVID-19 were 7, 7, and 9, respectively. The COVID-19 vaccine offers protective effects against intensive care unit admission, intubation, and death in hospitalized pregnant and postpartum women with severe SARS-CoV-2-induced SARS."

Methods. Population-based observational retrospective study conducted on a cohort of 19,850 patients aged 12 years or more, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between June 1st and December 31st, 2021, in the island of Gran Canaria. Results. Hypertension (18.5%), asthma (12.8%) and diabetes (7.2%) were the most frequent comorbidities; 147 patients died (0.7%). The combination of advanced age, male sex, cancer, coronary heart disease, immunosuppressive treatment, hospital admission, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation and lack of complete COVID-19 vaccination or booster dose was strongly predictive of mortality (p < 0.05); 831 patients required hospital admission and it was more frequent in men, older age groups, and patients with cancer, diabetes, arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure or immunosuppressive treatment. The COVID-19 vaccine booster dose was associated with a lower risk of death ([OR] 0.11, 95% CI 0.06-0.21, p < 0.05) or hospital admission ([OR] 0.36, 95% CI 0.29-0.46, p < 0.05). Conclusions. Cancer, coronary heart disease, and immunosuppressive treatment were associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. More complete vaccination was associated with lower risk of hospital admission or death. Three doses of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were highly associated with the prevention of death and hospital admission in all age groups. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination can help bring the pandemic under control."	"1578-8857

In some cases, vaccine hesitancy may be related to concerns about the number of reports of death to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). We aimed to provide information and context about reports of death to VAERS following COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: This is a descriptive study evaluating reporting rates for VAERS death reports for COVID-19 vaccine recipients in the United States between December 14, 2020, and November 17, 2021. Reporting rates were calculated as death events per million persons vaccinated and compared to expected all-cause (background) death rates. RESULTS: 9201 death events were reported for COVID-19 vaccine recipients aged 5 years and older (or age unknown). Reporting rates for death events increased with increasing age, and males generally had higher reporting rates than females. For death events within 7 days and 42 days of vaccination, respectively, observed reporting rates were lower than the expected all-cause death rates. Reporting rates for Ad26.COV2.S vaccine were generally higher than for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, but still lower than the expected all-cause death rates. Limitations of VAERS data include potential reporting bias, missing or inaccurate information, lack of a control group, and reported diagnoses, including deaths, are not causally verified diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Reporting rates for death events were lower than the all-cause death rates expected in the general population. Trends in reporting rates reflected known trends in background death rates. These findings do not suggest an association between vaccination and overall increased mortality."	"1099-1557

We examined the association between resident frailty and home-level characteristics with 30-day COVID-19 mortality before and after the availability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in LTC. METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of LTC residents with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Ontario, Canada. We used multi-level multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between 30-day COVID-19 mortality, the Hubbard Frailty Index (FI), and resident and home-level characteristics. We compared explanatory models before and after vaccine availability. RESULTS: There were 11,179 and 3,655 COVID-19 cases in the pre- and post-vaccine period, respectively. The 30-day COVID-19 mortality was 25.9 and 20.0% during the same periods. The median odds ratios for 30-day COVID-19 mortality between LTC homes were 1.50 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 1.41-1.65) and 1.62 (95% CrI: 1.46-1.96), respectively. In the pre-vaccine period, 30-day COVID-19 mortality was higher for males and those of greater age. For every 0.1 increase in the Hubbard FI, the odds of death were 1.49 (95% CI: 1.42-1.56) times higher. The association between frailty and mortality remained consistent in the post-vaccine period, but sex and age were partly attenuated. Despite the substantial home-level variation, no home-level characteristic examined was significantly associated with 30-day COVID-19 mortality during either period. INTERPRETATION: Frailty is consistently associated with COVID-19 mortality before and after the availability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Home-level characteristics previously attributed to COVID-19 outcomes do not explain significant home-to-home variation in COVID-19 mortality."	"1468-2834

Subsequently, its territories set French records for both COVID-19 and 6-month excess all-cause mortality. (2) Methods: Official time series were collected to compare time correlations between air traffic and COVID-19 transmission and mortality in overseas France, before and after the implementation of immunity passports. (3) Results: Air traffic initially had a reversed relationship with COVID-19, which transitioned into a leader-follower relationship with the introduction of immunity passports. Essentially, air traffic increased 16 days before COVID-19 cases increased (r = 0.61) and 26 days before deaths increased (r = 0.31) in Martinique, 26 days (r = 0.72) and 40 days (r = 0.82) before in Guadeloupe, and 29 days (r = 0.60) and 31 days (r = 0.41) before in Réunion upon introduction of immunity passports. Moreover, air traffic became as correlated as community transmission to COVID-19 mortality in Guadeloupe. (4) Conclusions: Since the introduction of immunity passports, air traffic has been pacesetting COVID-19 within one month for transmission, and within an additional two weeks for mortality in overseas France. Responding to WHO's call for real-world evidence, this study suggests that COVID-19 passports are not commensurate with health system goals."	"2076-393x

Different European countries have committed to vaccination strategies with variable population inoculation rates. We sought to investigate the extent to which the COVID-19 vaccination strategies, inoculation rate, and COVID-19 outcome differ between Cyprus and Malta. Data were obtained from the Ministry of Health websites and COVID-19 dashboards, while vaccination data were obtained from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control until mid-June, 2021. Comparative assessments were performed between the two countries using Microsoft(®) Excel for Mac, Version 16.54. Both islands took part in the European Union's advanced purchase agreement and received their first batch of vaccines on 27 December 2020. The positivity rate and mortality between December and June differs between the two countries (average positivity rate Cyprus 1.34, Malta 3.37 p ≤ 0.01; average mortality Cyprus 7.29, Malta 9.68 p ≤ 0.01). Both the positivity rate and mortality for Cyprus declined due to strict public health measures and vaccination roll-out in early January (positivity rate by 95% and mortality by 58%). In contrast, for Malta, there was a sharp increase (64% p ≤ 0.01) with almost no public health restrictions in place and soaring cases during the Christmas and Carnival period until March, when lockdown measures were re-introduced. A distinctive difference between Cyprus and Malta in positivity rate (14 per 100,000 population; p ≤ 0.01) can also be observed between January and mid-April 2021. However, from April onwards it is evident that the positivity rate and mortality decline (positivity rate Cyprus by 82%, Malta by 95%; mortality Cyprus by 90%, Malta by 95%, p ≤ 0.01, respectively) in both countries as the vaccination roll-outs progressed, covering about 58.93% of the Maltese population, while Cyprus had fully inoculated about 38.03% of its population. The vaccine strategies and vaccination rates were similar for both countries; yet Malta had the fastest vaccine roll-out. Reluctancy to get vaccinated, significant differences in the vaccination appointment scheduling system, and the freedom of vaccination choice for the citizens in Cyprus may have contributed to a delayed vaccination roll-out. These potential contributing factors should be acknowledged and considered for future vaccination programs and potential COVID-19 boosters."	"2227-9032

This study assesses COVID-19's mortality impact, while exploring the effects of the four dominant COVID-19 variants and that of the vaccination coverage on the Maltese population. METHODS: COVID-19 data (cases, mortality, positivity, and vaccination rates) was obtained from the websites of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control and the Malta Ministry of Health. Data was categorized into the four periods according to reported dominant COVID-19 variant. Years of life lost (YLL) and Case-Fatality-Ratio (CFR) for each period were estimated. CFR was also estimated for the pre-vaccine and post-vaccine periods. RESULTS: The original COVID-19 period (36 weeks) had the highest YLL (4,484), followed by the Omicron variant period (12 weeks; 1,398). The Alpha variant period (7 weeks) had the highest CFR (1.89%) followed by the Original COVID-19 (1.35%). The pre-vaccine (1.59%) period had higher CFR than the post-vaccine period (0.67%). CONCLUSION: Various factors contributed to mortality, but the variant's infectivity, transmissibility, and the effectiveness of the vaccine against the variant play an important role. Reducing mortality by embracing mass vaccination that targets current variants along with other non-pharmaceutical interventions remains paramount."	"2296-2565

This wave was driven by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron, a highly transmissible variant that infected even vaccinated people. Vaccination coverage disparities have played an important role in shaping the epidemic dynamics. Analyzing the epidemiological impact of this uneven vaccination coverage is essential to understand local differences in the spread and outcomes of the Omicron wave. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the impact of vaccination coverage disparity in the US in the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic during the third and fourth waves of the pandemic driven by the Delta and Omicron variants. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination coverage from 2,417 counties. The main outcomes of the study were new COVID-19 cases (incidence rate per 100,000 people) and new COVID-19 related deaths (mortality rate per 100,000 people) at county level and the main exposure variable was COVID-19 vaccination rate at county level. Geospatial and data visualization analyses were used to estimate the association between vaccination rate and COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates for the Delta and Omicron waves. RESULTS: During the Omicron wave, areas with high vaccination rates (>60%) experienced 1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-1.7) times higher COVID-19 incidence rate compared to areas with low vaccination rates (<40%). However, mortality rate was 1.6 (95% CI 1.5-1.7) higher in these low-vaccinated areas compared to areas with vaccination rates higher than 60%. As a result, areas with low vaccination rate had a 2.2 (95% CI 2.1-2.2) times higher case-fatality ratio. Geospatial clustering analysis showed a more defined spatial structure during the Delta wave with clusters with low vaccination rates and high incidence and mortality located in southern states. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the emergence of new virus variants with differential transmission potential, the protective effect of vaccines keeps generating marked differences in the distribution of critical health outcomes, with low vaccinated areas having the largest COVID-19 related mortality during the Delta and Omicron waves in the US. Vulnerable communities residing in low vaccinated areas, which are mostly rural, are suffering the highest burden of the COVID-19 pandemic during the vaccination era."	"2296-858x

Mortality"	"It has been suggested that the outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are better in individuals having recently received an influenza vaccine than in non-vaccinated individuals. We hypothesized that this association depends on the humoral responses against influenza viruses. We aim to assess the relationship between the humoral immunity against influenza and the 3-month all-cause mortality among hospitalized older patients with COVID-19. We performed an exploratory retrospective study of older patients (aged 65 and over) hospitalized for confirmed COVID-19 between November 2020 and June 2021. Previous humoral responses to influenza viruses were assessed using a hemagglutination inhibition assay on routinely collected blood samples. The study's primary outcome was the 3-month all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcomes were severe COVID-19 (oxygen requirement ≥ 6 L/min or ventilatory support) and complications (kidney or heart failure, thrombosis and bacterial infection). In the cohort of 95 patients with COVID-19, immunity against influenza vaccine subtypes/lineages was not significantly associated with 3-month all-cause mortality, with an OR [95%CI] of 0.22 [0.02-1.95] (p = 0.174) for the H1N1pdm09 subtype, 0.21 [0.03-1.24] (p = 0.081) for A/Hong Kong/2671/2019 H3N2 subtype, 1.98 [0.51-8.24] (p = 0.329) for the B/Victoria lineage, and 1.82 [0.40-8.45] (p = 0.437) for the B/Yamagata lineage. Immunity against influenza vaccine subtypes/lineages was also not significantly associated with severity and complication. Immunity against influenza subtypes/lineages included in the 2020-2021 vaccine was not associated with a lower 3-month all-cause mortality among COVID-19 hospitalized patients.Trial registration: The study was approved by a hospital committee with competency for research not requiring approval by an institutional review board (Tours University Medical Center, Tours, France: reference: 2021_015).

Patient Acuity"	"OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical profile of COVID-19 inpatients who were vaccinated prior to hospitalization and to compare the risk factors for death and the 28-day survival rate of between those inpatients vaccinated with one, two, or three doses and unvaccinated COVID-19 inpatients. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational cohort study involving COVID-19 patients admitted to a referral hospital in the city of Recife, Brazil, between July of 2020 and June of 2022. RESULTS: The sample comprised 1,921 inpatients, 996 of whom (50.8%) were vaccinated prior to hospitalization. After adjusting the mortality risk for vaccinated patients, those undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) had the highest mortality risk (adjusted OR [aOR] = 7.4; 95% CI, 3.8-14.1; p < 0.001), followed by patients > 80 years of age (aOR = 7.3; 95% CI, 3.4-15.4; p < 0.001), and those needing vasopressors (aOR = 5.6; 95% CI, 2.9-10.9; p < 0.001). After adjusting the mortality risk for all patients, having received three vaccine doses (aOR = 0.06; 95% CI, 0.03-0.11; p < 0.001) was the most important protective factor against death. There were progressive benefits of vaccination, reducing the frequency of ICU admissions, use for IMV, and death (respectively, from 44.9%, 39.0% and 39.9% after the first dose to 16.7%, 6.2% and 4.4% after the third dose), as well as significant improvements in survival after each subsequent dose (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccines were effective in reducing illness severity and death in this cohort of COVID-19 inpatients, and the administration of additional doses conferred them with accumulative vaccine protection."

We aimed to investigate whether previous immunisation affects long-term sequelae in the context of evolving variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: OnCovid is an active registry that includes patients aged 18 years or older from 37 institutions across Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and a history of solid or haematological malignancy, either active or in remission, followed up from COVID-19 diagnosis until death. We evaluated the prevalence of COVID-19 sequelae in patients who survived COVID-19 and underwent a formal clinical reassessment, categorising infection according to the date of diagnosis as the omicron (B.1.1.529) phase from Dec 15, 2021, to Jan 31, 2022; the alpha (B.1.1.7)-delta (B.1.617.2) phase from Dec 1, 2020, to Dec 14, 2021; and the pre-vaccination phase from Feb 27 to Nov 30, 2020. The prevalence of overall COVID-19 sequelae was compared according to SARS-CoV-2 immunisation status and in relation to post-COVID-19 survival and resumption of systemic anticancer therapy. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04393974. FINDINGS: At the follow-up update on June 20, 2022, 1909 eligible patients, evaluated after a median of 39 days (IQR 24-68) from COVID-19 diagnosis, were included (964 [50·7%] of 1902 patients with sex data were female and 938 [49·3%] were male). Overall, 317 (16·6%; 95% CI 14·8-18·5) of 1909 patients had at least one sequela from COVID-19 at the first oncological reassessment. The prevalence of COVID-19 sequelae was highest in the pre-vaccination phase (191 [19·1%; 95% CI 16·4-22·0] of 1000 patients). The prevalence was similar in the alpha-delta phase (110 [16·8%; 13·8-20·3] of 653 patients, p=0·24), but significantly lower in the omicron phase (16 [6·2%; 3·5-10·2] of 256 patients, p<0·0001). In the alpha-delta phase, 84 (18·3%; 95% CI 14·6-22·7) of 458 unvaccinated patients and three (9·4%; 1·9-27·3) of 32 unvaccinated patients in the omicron phase had sequelae. Patients who received a booster and those who received two vaccine doses had a significantly lower prevalence of overall COVID-19 sequelae than unvaccinated or partially vaccinated patients (ten [7·4%; 95% CI 3·5-13·5] of 136 boosted patients, 18 [9·8%; 5·8-15·5] of 183 patients who had two vaccine doses vs 277 [18·5%; 16·5-20·9] of 1489 unvaccinated patients, p=0·0001), respiratory sequelae (six [4·4%; 1·6-9·6], 11 [6·0%; 3·0-10·7] vs 148 [9·9%; 8·4-11·6], p=0·030), and prolonged fatigue (three [2·2%; 0·1-6·4], ten [5·4%; 2·6-10·0] vs 115 [7·7%; 6·3-9·3], p=0·037). INTERPRETATION: Unvaccinated patients with cancer remain highly vulnerable to COVID-19 sequelae irrespective of viral strain. This study confirms the role of previous SARS-CoV-2 immunisation as an effective measure to protect patients from COVID-19 sequelae, disruption of therapy, and ensuing mortality.

vaccine"	"National (and global) vaccination provides an opportunity to control the COVID-19 pandemic, which disease suppression by societal lockdown and individual behavioural changes will not. We modelled how vaccination through the UK's vaccine priority groups impacts deaths, hospital and ICU admissions from COVID-19. We used the UK COVID-19 vaccines delivery plan and publicly available data to estimate UK population by age group and vaccination priority group, including frontline health and social care workers and individuals deemed 'extreme clinical vulnerable' or 'high risk'. Using published data on numbers and distributions of COVID-19-related hospital and ICU admissions and deaths, we modelled the impact of vaccination by age group. We then modified the model to account for hospital and ICU admission, and death among health and social care workers and the population with extreme clinical vulnerability and high risk. Our model closely matches the government's estimates for mortality after vaccination of priority groups 1-4 and groups 1-9. The model shows vaccination will have a much slower impact on hospital and ICU admissions than on deaths. The early prioritisation of healthcare staff and clinically vulnerable patients increases the impact of vaccination on admissions and also protects the healthcare service. An inflection point, when 50% of the adult population has been vaccinated - with deaths reduced by 95% and hospital admissions by 80% - may be a useful point for re-evaluating vaccine prioritisation. Our model suggests substantial reductions in hospital and ICU admissions will not occur until late March and into April 2021."	"1365-2044

Influenza vaccination"	"BACKGROUND: With a unique influenza season occurring in the midst of a pandemic, there is interest in assessing the role of the influenza vaccine in COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, patients receiving a laboratory test for COVID-19 were identified. The primary outcome was comparison of positive COVID-19 testing in those who received the influenza vaccine versus those who did not. Secondary end points in patients testing positive for COVID-19 included mortality, need for hospitalization, length of stay, need for intensive care, and mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 27,201 patients received laboratory testing for COVID-19. The odds of testing positive for COVID-19 was reduced in patients who received an influenza vaccine compared to those who did not (odds ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.68-0.86; P < .001). Vaccinated patients testing positive for COVID-19 were less likely to require hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.73; P < .001), or mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.78; P  = .004) and had a shorter hospital length of stay (risk ratio, 0.76, 95% CI 0.65-0.89; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Influenza vaccination is associated with decreased positive COVID-19 testing and improved clinical outcomes and should be promoted to reduce the burden of COVID-19."	"1527-3296

To this end, the odds ratio (OR) for mortality and hospitalization was calculated for different groups of patients by applying an adjusted logistic regression model based on the following variables of interest: gender, booster vaccination, age group, and comorbidity occurrence. A massive number of data were extracted and compiled from official Brazilian government resources, which include all reported cases of hospitalizations and deaths associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Brazil during the "wave" of the Omicron variant (BA.1 substrain). Males (1.242; 95% CI 1.196-1.290) aged 60-79 (3.348; 95% CI 3.050-3.674) and 80 years or older (5.453; 95% CI 4.966-5.989), and hospitalized patients with comorbidities (1.418; 95% CI 1.355-1.483), were more likely to die. There was a reduction in the risk of death (0.907; 95% CI 0.866-0.951) among patients who had received the third dose of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (booster). Additionally, this big data investigation has found statistical evidence that vaccination can support mitigation plans concerning the current scenario of COVID-19 in Brazil since the Omicron variant and its substrains are now prevalent across the entire country."

However, protection from coronavirus disease 2019 is not absolute and an optimal vaccination regimen needs to be established. This study assessed the clinical efficacy of the coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine among dialysis patients receiving 3 or 4 doses of vaccine. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: This retrospective study was conducted using the electronic database of Clalit Health Maintenance Organization in Israel. Chronic dialysis patients treated with either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic were included. We compared clinical outcomes of patients who had received three or four doses of the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 vaccine. RESULTS: This study included 1,030 patients on chronic dialysis, with a mean age of 68 ± 13 years. Among them, 502 patients had received 3 doses of the vaccine and 528 received 4 doses. Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 infection rates, severe COVID-19 that resulted in hospitalizations, COVID-19-related mortality and all-cause mortality rates were lower among chronic dialysis patients who received a fourth dose of vaccine as compared to those who received only 3 doses (after controlling for age, sex and comorbidities). Despite lower mortality rates observed with the Omicron variant, the fourth dose was significantly associated with reduced COVID-19-related mortality (1.7% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.04). Odds ratio for COVID-19-related mortality was 0.44 with 95% CI 0.2-0.98. CONCLUSIONS: As seen in the general population and with previous vaccine boosters, the fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine reduced rates of severe COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality among chronic dialysis patients. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal regimens of vaccination for patients on chronic dialysis."	"1724-6059

Its distinct bleeding and thrombotic patterns compared with other platelet consumptive disorders remain unclear. METHODS:  We performed a systematic review of the literature (PubMed and Embase) up to July 31, 2022, including case reports and case series providing nonaggregate data of VITT patients. Accurate VITT diagnosis required fulfillment of the following criteria: (1) endorsement by the authors, (2) consistent vaccine type and timing, (3) presence of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, (4) detection of anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies. Data are presented as frequencies with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated with the exact binomial method. RESULTS:  We retrieved 143 eligible studies, describing 366 patients. Of 647 thrombotic events, 53% (95% CI: 49-56) were venous thromboses at unusual sites and 30% (95% CI: 27-34) were cerebral venous sinus thromboses (CVSTs). The ratio of venous-to-arterial events was 4.1. Thromboses in most sites were associated with at least another thrombotic event, with the exception of CVST and CNS arterial thrombosis (isolated in 49 and 39% of cases, respectively). Bleeding occurred in 36% (95% CI: 31-41) of patients; 68% (95% CI: 59-75) of bleeding events were intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs). Overall mortality was 24% (95% CI: 19-29), and 77% (95% CI: 58-90) in patients with isolated CVST complicated by ICH. CONCLUSION:  VITT displays a venous-to-arterial thrombosis ratio comparable to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. However, VITT is characterized by a higher prevalence of CVST and ICH, which contribute to the increased bleeding frequency and mortality."	"2567-689x

While primary series vaccination rates are generally high in Southeast Asian (SEA) countries, various factors have limited the rollout and impact of booster doses. AREAS COVERED: We reviewed 79 studies in the International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC) VIEW-hub platform on vaccine effectiveness (VE) after primary immunizations with two-dose schedules. VE data were reported for SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths, and stratified across variants of concern, age, study design and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection for mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and combinations of both), vector vaccines (AstraZeneca, AZD1222 [ChAdOx1 nCoV-19] 'Vaxzevria'), and inactivated virus vaccines (CoronaVac). EXPERT OPINION: The most-studied COVID-19 vaccines provide consistently high (>90%) protection against serious clinical outcomes like hospitalizations and deaths, regardless of variant. Additionally, this protection appears equivalent for mRNA vaccines and vector vaccines like AZD1222, as supported by our analysis of Asian and relevant international data, and by insights from SEA experts. Given the continued impact of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths on health-care systems worldwide, encouraging vaccination strategies that reduce this burden is more relevant than attempting to prevent broader but milder infections with specific variants, including Omicron."

mRNA vaccine"	"BACKGROUND: Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections following vaccination against COVID-19 are of international concern. Patients with cancer have been observed to have worse outcomes associated with COVID-19 during the pandemic. We sought to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with cancer who developed breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections after 2 or 3 doses of mRNA vaccines. METHODS: We evaluated the clinical characteristics of patients with cancer who developed breakthrough infections using data from the multi-institutional COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19; NCT04354701). Analysis was restricted to patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed in 2021 or 2022, to allow for a contemporary unvaccinated control population; potential differences were evaluated using a multivariable logistic regression model after inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for potential baseline confounding variables. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality, with key secondary endpoints of hospitalization and ICU and/or mechanical ventilation (ICU/MV). FINDINGS: The analysis included 2486 patients, of which 564 and 385 had received 2 or 3 doses of an mRNA vaccine prior to infection, respectively. Hematologic malignancies and recent receipt of systemic anti-neoplastic therapy were more frequent among vaccinated patients. Vaccination was associated with improved outcomes: in the primary analysis, 2 doses (aOR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.44-0.88) and 3 doses (aOR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.11-0.36) were associated with decreased 30-day mortality. There were similar findings for the key secondary endpoints of ICU/MV (aOR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.45-0.82 and 0.37, 95% CI: 0.24-0.58) and hospitalization (aOR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.48-0.75 and 0.35, 95% CI: 0.26-0.46) for 2 and 3 doses, respectively. Importantly, Black patients had higher rates of hospitalization (aOR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.12-1.92), and Hispanic patients presented with higher rates of ICU/MV (aOR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.06-2.44). INTERPRETATION: Vaccination against COVID-19, especially with additional doses, is a fundamental strategy in the prevention of adverse outcomes including death, among patients with cancer. FUNDING: This study was partly supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute grant number P30 CA068485 to C-YH, YS, SM, JLW; T32-CA236621 and P30-CA046592 to C.R.F; CTSA 2UL1TR001425-05A1 to TMW-D; ACS/FHI Real-World Data Impact Award, P50 MD017341-01, R21 CA242044-01A1, Susan G.

vaccination priority strategy"	"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination has recently started worldwide. As the vaccine supply will be limited for a considerable period of time in many countries, it is important to devise the effective vaccination strategies that reduce the number of deaths and incidence of infection. One of the characteristics of COVID-19 is that the symptom, severity, and mortality of the disease differ by age. Thus, when the vaccination supply is limited, age-dependent vaccination priority strategy should be implemented to minimize the incidences and mortalities. In this study, we developed an age-structured model for describing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, including vaccination. Using the model and actual epidemiological data in Korea, we estimated the infection probability for each age group under different levels of social distancing implemented in Korea and investigated the effective age-dependent vaccination strategies to reduce the confirmed cases and fatalities of COVID-19. We found that, in a lower level of social distancing, vaccination priority for the age groups with the highest transmission rates will reduce the incidence mostly, but, in higher levels of social distancing, prioritizing vaccination for the elderly age group reduces the infection incidences more effectively. To reduce mortalities, vaccination priority for the elderly age group is the best strategy in all scenarios of levels of social distancing. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of vaccine supply and efficacy on the reduction in incidence and mortality."	"1660-4601

COVID-19 vaccines may substantially reduce these risks, but evidence is needed of their effectiveness for incarcerated people, who are confined in large, risky congregate settings. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to estimate effectiveness of mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among incarcerated people in California prisons from December 22, 2020 through March 1, 2021. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation provided daily data for all prison residents including demographic, clinical, and carceral characteristics, as well as COVID-19 testing, vaccination status, and outcomes. We estimated vaccine effectiveness using multivariable Cox models with time-varying covariates that adjusted for resident characteristics and infection rates across prisons. FINDINGS: Among 60,707 residents in the cohort, 49% received at least one BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 dose during the study period. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was 74% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64-82%) from day 14 after first dose until receipt of second dose and 97% (95% CI, 88-99%) from day 14 after second dose. Effectiveness was similar among the subset of residents who were medically vulnerable (74% [95% CI, 62-82%] and 92% [95% CI, 74-98%] from 14 days after first and second doses, respectively), as well as among the subset of residents who received the mRNA-1273 vaccine (71% [95% CI, 58-80%] and 96% [95% CI, 67-99%]). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with results from randomized trials and observational studies in other populations, mRNA vaccines were highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections among incarcerated people. Prioritizing incarcerated people for vaccination, redoubling efforts to boost vaccination and continuing other ongoing mitigation practices are essential in preventing COVID-19 in this disproportionately affected population.

Both the oral antiviral drugs and vaccines were associated with lower risks for all-cause mortality and progression to serious/critical/fatal conditions (study outcomes). No significant interaction effects were observed between the antiviral drugs and vaccinations; their joint effects were additive. If antiviral drugs were prescribed within 5 days of confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, usage was associated with lower risks for the target outcomes for patients >60, but not <60, years of age; no significant clinical benefit was found if prescribed beyond 5 days. Among patients >80 years of age, 3-4 doses of Comirnaty vaccine were associated with significantly lower risks for target outcomes.

It is unknown whether disparities in pandemic-related mortality across occupational sectors have continued to occur during the periods of SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccine availability. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study, we obtained data from the California Department of Public Health on all deaths occurring in the state of California, USA, from Jan 1, 2016, to Dec 31, 2021. We restricted our analysis to residents of California who were aged 18-65 years at time of death and died of natural causes. We classified the occupational sector into nine essential sectors; non-essential; or unemployed or without an occupation provided on the death certificate. We calculated the number of COVID-19 deaths in total and per capita that occurred in each occupational sector. Separately, using autoregressive integrated moving average models, we estimated total, per-capita, and relative excess natural-cause mortality by week between March 1, 2020, and Nov 30, 2021, stratifying by occupational sector. We additionally stratified analyses of occupational risk into counties with high versus low vaccine uptake, categorising high-uptake regions as counties where at least 50% of the population were fully vaccinated according to US guidelines by Aug 1, 2021. FINDINGS: From March 1, 2020, to Nov 30, 2021, 24 799 COVID-19 deaths were reported in residents of California aged 18-65 years and an estimated 28 751 (95% prediction interval 27 853-29 653) excess deaths. People working in essential sectors were associated with higher COVID-19 deaths and excess deaths than were those working in non-essential sectors, with the highest per-capita COVID-19 mortality in the agriculture (131·8 per 100 000 people), transportation or logistics (107·1 per 100 000), manufacturing (103·3 per 100 000), facilities (101·1 per 100 000), and emergency (87·8 per 100 000) sectors. Disparities were wider during periods of increased infections, including during the Nov 29, 2020, to Feb 27, 2021, surge in infections, which was driven by the delta variant (B.1.617.2) and occurred during vaccine uptake. During the June 27 to Nov 27, 2021 surge, emergency workers had higher COVID-19 mortality (113·7 per 100 000) than workers from any other sector. Workers in essential sectors had the highest COVID-19 mortality in counties with low vaccination uptake, a difference that was more pronounced during the period of the delta infection surge during Nov 29, 2020, to Feb 27, 2021. INTERPRETATION: Workers in essential sectors have continued to bear the brunt of high COVID-19 and excess mortality throughout the pandemic, particularly in the agriculture, emergency, manufacturing, facilities, and transportation or logistics sectors. This high death toll has continued during periods of vaccine availability and the delta surge. In an ongoing pandemic without widespread vaccine coverage and with anticipated threats of new variants, the USA must actively adopt policies to more adequately protect workers in essential sectors.

We use official reported data retrieved from Shanghai municipal Health Commissions to estimate the incidence of infections, severe/critical infections, and deaths to assess the disease burden. By adjusting for right censoring and RT-PCR sensitivity, we provide estimates of clinical severity, including the infection fatality ratio, symptomatic case fatality ratio, and risk of developing severe/critical disease upon infection. The overall infection rate, severe/critical infection rate, and mortality rate were 2.74 (95% CI: 2.73-2.74) per 100 individuals, 6.34 (95% CI: 6.02-6.66) per 100,000 individuals and 2.42 (95% CI: 2.23-2.62) per 100,000 individuals, respectively. The severe/critical infection rate and mortality rate increased with age, noted in individuals aged 80 years or older. The overall fatality ratio and risk of developing severe/critical disease upon infection were 0.09% (95% CI: 0.09-0.10%) and 0.27% (95% CI: 0.24-0.29%), respectively. Having received at least one vaccine dose led to a 10-fold reduction in the risk of death for infected individuals aged 80 years or older. Under the repeated population-based screenings and strict intervention policies implemented in Shanghai, our results found a lower disease burden and mortality of the outbreak compared to other settings and countries, showing the impact of the successful outbreak containment in Shanghai. The estimated low clinical severity of this Omicron BA.2 epidemic in Shanghai highlight the key contribution of vaccination and availability of hospital beds to reduce the risk of death."	"2222-1751

Timely vaccination could be the most effective strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, data on the survival benefit of the COVID-19 vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and death among HD patients are limited, especially during the Omicron-dominant period. METHODS: In this prospective hospital-based cohort study, we identified HD patients from July 1, 2021, to April 29, 2022. The patients were divided into fully vaccinated and partially vaccinated groups. We compared the humoral response, risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection, and all-cause mortality between the two groups. RESULTS: Among the 440 HD patients included, 152 patients were fully vaccinated, and 288 patients were partially vaccinated. Patients in the fully vaccinated group exhibited higher anti-spike protein receptor-binding domain (S protein RBD) antibody levels and lower risks of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.73; p = 0.005) than the partially vaccinated group. However, the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection did not significantly differ between the two groups. Irrespective of the number of vaccinations, the risk of all-cause mortality was lower in patients with anti-S protein RBD antibody levels in the higher tertile. CONCLUSION: A third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality among HD patients during the Omicron-dominant period. A higher post-vaccination anti-S protein RBD antibody level was also associated with a lower risk of mortality."	"1995-9133

Pandemics"	"IMPORTANCE: Adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) are particularly vulnerable to the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Deaths associated with ADRD increased substantially in pandemic year 1. It is unclear whether mortality associated with ADRD declined when better prevention strategies, testing, and vaccines became widely available in year 2. OBJECTIVE: To compare pandemic-era excess deaths associated with ADRD between year 1 and year 2 overall and by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and place of death. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This time series analysis used all death certificates of US decedents 65 years and older with ADRD as an underlying or contributing cause of death from January 2014 through February 2022. EXPOSURE: COVID-19 pandemic era. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pandemic-era excess deaths associated with ADRD were defined as the difference between deaths with ADRD as an underlying or contributing cause observed from March 2020 to February 2021 (year 1) and March 2021 to February 2022 (year 2) compared with expected deaths during this period. Expected deaths were estimated using data from January 2014 to February 2020 fitted with autoregressive integrated moving average models. RESULTS: Overall, 2 334 101 death certificates were analyzed. A total of 94 688 (95% prediction interval [PI], 84 192-104 890) pandemic-era excess deaths with ADRD were estimated in year 1 and 21 586 (95% PI, 10 631-32 450) in year 2. Declines in ADRD-related deaths in year 2 were substantial for every age, sex, and racial and ethnic group evaluated. Pandemic-era ADRD-related excess deaths declined among nursing home/long-term care residents (from 34 259 [95% PI, 25 819-42 677] in year 1 to -22 050 [95% PI, -30 765 to -13 273] in year 2), but excess deaths at home remained high (from 34 487 [95% PI, 32 815-36 142] in year 1 to 28 804 [95% PI, 27 067-30 571] in year 2). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that large increases in mortality with ADRD as an underlying or contributing cause of death occurred in COVID-19 pandemic year 1 but were largely mitigated in pandemic year 2. The most pronounced declines were observed for deaths in nursing home/long-term care settings. Conversely, excess deaths at home and in medical facilities remained high in year 2."	"2168-6157

However, the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine boosters has not much been investigated in hemodialysis (HD) patients receiving oral antiviral agents. In this retrospective study involving 258 HD patients with COVID-19 receiving molnupiravir, we stratified the study cohort according to vaccination status and compared the baseline characteristics and risks of 30-day composite events (COVID-19-related acute care visits, hospitalization, or mortality) among groups. Our analysis demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine boosters markedly decreased the risk of composite events in HD patients (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval), 0.163 (0.063-0.423) for three vs. ≤ two doses of vaccination, p < 0.001; 0.309 (0.115-0.830) for four vs. ≤ two doses of vaccination, p = 0.020). The benefits of vaccine boosters were similar between patients receiving mRNA-based and protein-based boosters and between those with post-booster intervals of ≤ 120 and > 120 days. In conclusion, for HD patients with initially mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 receiving molnupiravir, the benefits of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine boosters are prominent, irrespective of booster vaccine types."

However, true understanding of its impact is skewed by heterogeneous vaccine administration due to lack of equitable access, vaccine hesitancy, and varying social determinants of health. Therefore, this study aims to identify groups that are less likely to be vaccinated and understand whether the resultant differences in vaccination rates affect morbidity and mortality in socially marginalized COVID-19 patients. A retrospective cohort analysis was performed on a randomized and stratified population of 939 COVID-19 patients from January 2021 to December 2021. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were used to assess demographic and clinical characteristic trends in unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated groups. No one age (P = .21), gender (P = .9), race (P = .12), ethnicity (P = .09), or health insurance status (P = .13) group was more vaccinated than the other. Similarly, no subgroup was at increased odds of intubation (P = .08) or death. However, patients with all categories of comorbidities including cardiopulmonary disease (P = <.001, effect size .17), renal disease (P = <.001, effect size 0.138), metabolic disease (P = .04), and immunocompromised (P = .01) states were found to have significantly higher vaccination rates. Our study also shows that full vaccination protects against mortality and decreases the odds of intubation by 55% (adjusted odds ratio = 0.453, P value = .015) compared to no vaccination or partial vaccination. Findings from this study show an encouraging trend that sicker patients had higher rates of vaccination against COVID-19. This trend highlights the need for further identification of motivators that may be applied to vaccine-hesitant populations, which can help guide population-level policy, increase vaccination campaign yield, and reach for health equity."

However, vaccine effectiveness data are limited from Sub-Saharan Africa. We report COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against progression to in-hospital mortality in Zambia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among admitted patients at 8 COVID-19 treatment centers across Zambia during April 2021 through March 2022, when the Delta and Omicron variants were circulating. Patient demographic and clinical information including vaccination status and hospitalization outcome (discharged or died) were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the odds of in-hospital mortality by vaccination status, adjusted for age, sex, number of comorbid conditions, disease severity, hospitalization month, and COVID-19 treatment center. Vaccine effectiveness of ≥1 vaccine dose was calculated from the adjusted odds ratio. RESULTS: Among 1653 patients with data on their vaccination status and hospitalization outcome, 365 (22.1%) died. Overall, 236 (14.3%) patients had received ≥1 vaccine dose before hospital admission. Of the patients who had received ≥1 vaccine dose, 22 (9.3%) died compared with 343 (24.2%) among unvaccinated patients (P < .01). The median time since receipt of a first vaccine dose (interquartile range) was 52.5 (28-107) days. Vaccine effectiveness for progression to in-hospital mortality among hospitalized patients was 64.8% (95% CI, 42.3%-79.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients admitted to COVID-19 treatment centers in Zambia, COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower progression to in-hospital mortality. These data are consistent with evidence from other countries demonstrating the benefit of COVID-19 vaccination against severe complications. Vaccination is a critical tool for reducing the consequences of COVID-19 in Zambia."	"2328-8957

We estimated the risk of COVID-19 deaths and SARS-CoV-2 infections according to vaccination status in previously infected individuals in Austria. METHODS: This is a nationwide retrospective observational study. We calculated age and gender adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) of COVID-19 deaths (primary outcome) and SARS-CoV-2 infections (secondary outcome) from 1 November to 31 December 2022, primarily comparing individuals with four versus three vaccine doses. Relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) was calculated as (1-HR) X 100. RESULTS: Among 3,986,312 previously infected individuals, 281,291 (7,1%) had four and 1,545,242 (38.8%) had three vaccinations at baseline. We recorded 69 COVID-19 deaths and 89,056 SARS-CoV-2 infections. rVE for four versus three vaccine doses was -24% (95% CI: -120 to 30) against COVID-19 deaths, and 17% (95% CI: 14-19) against SARS-CoV-2 infections. This latter effect rapidly diminished over time and infection risk with four vaccinations was higher compared to less vaccinated individuals during extended follow-up until June 2023. Adjusted HR (95% CI) for all-cause mortality for four versus three vaccinations was 0.79 (0.74-0.85). DISCUSSION: In previously infected individuals, a fourth vaccination was not associated with COVID-19 death risk, but with transiently reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections and reversal of this effect in longer follow-up. All-cause mortality data suggest healthy vaccinee bias."	"1365-2362

SARS-CoV-2"	"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccines have proven highly effective among individuals without a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, but their effectiveness in preventing symptomatic infection and severe outcomes among individuals with previous infection is less clear. We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of four COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic infection, hospitalisation, and death for individuals with laboratory-confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Using national COVID-19 notification, hospitalisation, and vaccination datasets from Brazil, we did a test-negative, case-control study to assess the effectiveness of four vaccines (CoronaVac [Sinovac], ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [AstraZeneca], Ad26.COV2.S [Janssen], and BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNtech]) for individuals with laboratory-confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. We matched cases with RT-PCR positive, symptomatic COVID-19 with up to ten controls with negative RT-PCR tests who presented with symptomatic illnesses, restricting both groups to tests done at least 90 days after an initial infection. We used multivariable conditional logistic regression to compare the odds of test positivity and the odds of hospitalisation or death due to COVID-19, according to vaccination status and time since first or second dose of vaccines. FINDINGS: Between Feb 24, 2020, and Nov 11, 2021, we identified 213 457 individuals who had a subsequent, symptomatic illness with RT-PCR testing done at least 90 days after their initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and after the vaccination programme started. Among these, 30 910 (14·5%) had a positive RT-PCR test consistent with reinfection, and we matched 22 566 of these cases with 145 055 negative RT-PCR tests from 68 426 individuals as controls. Among individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection 14 or more days from vaccine series completion was 39·4% (95% CI 36·1-42·6) for CoronaVac, 56·0% (51·4-60·2) for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 44·0% (31·5-54·2) for Ad26.COV2.S, and 64·8% (54·9-72·4) for BNT162b2. For the two-dose vaccine series (CoronaVac, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and BNT162b2), effectiveness against symptomatic infection was significantly greater after the second dose than after the first dose. Effectiveness against hospitalisation or death 14 or more days from vaccine series completion was 81·3% (75·3-85·8) for CoronaVac, 89·9% (83·5-93·8) for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 57·7% (-2·6 to 82·5) for Ad26.COV2.S, and 89·7% (54·3-97·7) for BNT162b2. INTERPRETATION: All four vaccines conferred additional protection against symptomatic infections and severe outcomes among individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The provision of a full vaccine series to individuals after recovery from COVID-19 might reduce morbidity and mortality.

DESIGN: Test negative, case-control study. SETTING: Database of the National Surveillance System and the Nominalized Federal Vaccination Registry of Argentina. PARTICIPANTS: 844 460 children and adolescents without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection eligible to receive primary vaccination schedule who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction or rapid antigen test from September 2021 to April 2022. After matching with their corresponding controls, 139 321 (60.3%) of 231 181 cases remained for analysis. EXPOSURES: Two dose mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and BBIBP-CorV vaccination schedule. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: SARS-CoV-2 infection and covid-19 related death. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among two dose vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as (1-odds ratio)×100%. RESULTS: Estimated vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection was 61.2% (95% confidence interval 56.4% to 65.5%) in children and 66.8% (63.9% to 69.5%) in adolescents during the delta dominant period and 15.9% (13.2% to 18.6%) and 26.0% (23.2% to 28.8%), respectively, when omicron was dominant. Vaccine effectiveness declined over time, especially during the omicron period, from 37.6% (34.2% to 40.8%) at 15-30 days after vaccination to 2.0% (1.8% to 5.6%) after ≥60 days in children and from 55.8% (52.4% to 59.0%) to 12.4% (8.6% to 16.1%) in adolescents.Vaccine effectiveness against death related to SARS-CoV-2 infection during omicron predominance was 66.9% (6.4% to 89.8%) in children and 97.6% (81.0% to 99.7%) in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine effectiveness in preventing mortality remained high in children and adolescents regardless of the circulating variant. Vaccine effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the short term after vaccination was lower during omicron predominance and decreasing sharply over time.

Troponin elevation"	"COVID-19 with myocardial injury, defined as troponin elevation, is associated with worse outcomes. The temporal changes in outcomes during various phases of the pandemic remain unclear. We evaluated outcomes during the Omicron phase compared with previous phases of the pandemic. We analyzed patients who were COVID-19-positive with evidence of myocardial injury who presented to the MedStar Health system (11 hospitals in Washington, District of Columbia, and Maryland) during phase 1 of the pandemic (March to June 2020), phase 2 (October 2020 to January 2021), and phase 3 (Omicron; December 2021 to March 2022), comparing their characteristics and outcomes. The primary end point was in-hospital mortality. The cohort included 2,079 patients admitted who were COVID-19 positive and for whom troponin was elevated (phase 1: n = 150, phase 2: n = 854, phase 3: n = 1,075). Baseline characteristics were similar overall. Inflammatory markers were significantly elevated in phase 1 compared with phases 2 and 3. The use of remdesivir and dexamethasone was highest in phase 2. In phase 3, 52.6% of patients were fully vaccinated. In-hospital mortality, though high, was lower in phase 3 than in phases 1 and 2 (59.3% vs 28.1% vs 23.3%; p <0.001). Patients who were vaccinated showed more favorable in-hospital outcomes than did those who were unvaccinated (18.3% vs 24.2%, p = 0.042). In conclusion, patients with COVID-19 with elevated troponin during phase 3 tended to have improved outcomes when compared with patients in earlier waves of the pandemic. This improvement could be attributed to the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccines, advances in COVID-19 treatment options, provider experience, and less virulent variants."	"1879-1913

Stratified analysis"	"BACKGROUND: Available national public data are often too incomplete and noisy to be used directly to interpret the evolution of epidemics over time, which is essential for making timely and appropriate decisions. The use of compartment models can be a worthwhile and attractive approach to address this problem. The present study proposes a model compartmentalized by sex and age groups that allows for more complete information on the evolution of the CoViD-19 pandemic in Italy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Italian public data on CoViD-19 were pre-treated with a 7-day moving average filter to reduce noise. A time-varying susceptible-infected-recovered-deceased (SIRD) model distributed by age and sex groups was then proposed. Recovered and infected individuals distributed by groups were reconstructed through the SIRD model, which was also used to simulate and identify optimal scenarios of pandemic containment by vaccination. The simulation started from realistic initial conditions based on the SIRD model parameters, estimated from filtered and reconstructed Italian data, at different pandemic times and phases. The following three objective functions, accounting for total infections, total deaths, and total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, were minimized by optimizing the percentages of vaccinated individuals in five different age groups. RESULTS: The developed SIRD model clearly highlighted those pandemic phases in which younger people, who had more contacts and lower mortality, infected older people, characterized by a significantly higher mortality, especially in males. Optimizing vaccination strategies yielded different results depending on the cost function used. As expected, to reduce total deaths, the suggested strategy was to vaccinate the older age groups, whatever the baseline scenario. In contrast, for QALYs lost and total infections, the optimal vaccine solutions strongly depended on the initial pandemic conditions: during phases of high virus diffusion, the model suggested to vaccinate mainly younger groups with a higher contact rate. CONCLUSION: Because of the poor quality and insufficient availability of stratified public pandemic data, ad hoc information filtering and reconstruction procedures proved essential. The time-varying SIRD model, stratified by age and sex groups, provided insights and additional information on the dynamics of CoViD-19 infection in Italy, also supporting decision making for containment strategies such as vaccination."

Waning immunity"	"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to extensive vaccination campaigns worldwide, including in Australia. Immunity waning and the emergence of new viral variants pose challenges to the effectiveness of vaccines. Our study aimed to assess the relative effectiveness (rVE) of 3 and 4 compared with 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine. The study focuses on the Victorian population, a majority of whom had no prior exposure to the virus before vaccination. METHODS: We used routinely collected data for the state of Victoria, Australia, to assess rVE during an Omicron-dominant period, 1 June 2022 to 1 March 2023. Immunisation, notifications, hospitalisations and mortality data for residents aged 65 years and older were linked for analysis. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the rVE against COVID-19 hospitalisation or death, accounting for key confounders with vaccination as a time-varying covariate. RESULTS: In 1,070,113 people 65 years or older who had received their second dose, a third and fourth dose of a COVID-19 vaccine significantly reduced the hazard of hospitalisation or death compared to two doses. rVE was highest within two weeks from administration at 40 % (95 % CI: 0 % to 64 %) and 66 % (95 % CI: 60 % to 71 %) for a third and fourth dose, respectively. Additional protection conferred by third and fourth doses waned over time from administration. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the need for additional vaccine doses and updated vaccine strategies. These findings have implications for public health advice and COVID-19 vaccine strategies. Further research and monitoring of vaccine effectiveness in real-world settings are warranted to inform ongoing pandemic response efforts."	"1873-2518

Treatment Outcome"	"OBJECTIVE: To determine associations of BNT162b2 vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospital admission and death with covid-19 among nursing home residents, nursing home staff, and healthcare workers. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Nursing homes and linked electronic medical record, test, and mortality data in Catalonia on 27 December 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 28 456 nursing home residents, 26 170 nursing home staff, and 61 791 healthcare workers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were followed until the earliest outcome (confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospital admission or death with covid-19) or 26 May 2021. Vaccination status was introduced as a time varying exposure, with a 14 day run-in after the first dose. Mixed effects Cox models were fitted to estimate hazard ratios with index month as a fixed effect and adjusted for confounders including sociodemographics, comorbidity, and previous medicine use. RESULTS: Among the nursing home residents, SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in 2482, 411 were admitted to hospital with covid-19, and 450 died with covid-19 during the study period. In parallel, 1828 nursing home staff and 2968 healthcare workers were found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, but fewer than five were admitted or died with covid-19. The adjusted hazard ratio for SARS-CoV-2 infection after two doses of vaccine was 0.09 (95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.11) for nursing home residents, 0.20 (0.17 to 0.24) for nursing home staff, and 0.13 (0.11 to 0.16) for healthcare workers. Adjusted hazard ratios for hospital admission and mortality after two doses of vaccine were 0.05 (0.04 to 0.07) and 0.03 (0.02 to 0.04), respectively, for nursing home residents. Nursing home staff and healthcare workers recorded insufficient events for mortality analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination was associated with 80-91% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection in all three cohorts and greater reductions in hospital admissions and mortality among nursing home residents for up to five months. More data are needed on longer term effects of covid-19 vaccines."	"1756-1833

Among 109 vaccinated patients, 84 patients were partially and 25 fully vaccinated. Vaccinated patients experienced significantly lower 30 days mortality (30% vs. 49%; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.56 [0.37-0.85]; p = 0.008), less frequently required high flow oxygen therapy (17% vs. 34%; HR: 0.45 [0.26-0.76]; p = 0.005), and mechanical ventilation (8% vs. 18%; HR: 0.41 [0.20-0.88]; p = 0.027) in comparison to the matched cohort of unvaccinated patients. More favorable survival was observed in patients receiving vector in comparison to messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine types in unadjusted analysis (30 days mortality 18% vs. 40%; HR: 0.45 [0.25-0.79]; p = 0.034).

The possibility of ICU admission after the first-cycle vaccination has been already reported; however, no data have been published regarding vaccinated patients with a "booster" dose. This retrospective study describes the characteristics of critically ill patients after the implementation of the regional "booster" dose vaccination program in a southern region of Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened all medical records of critically ill COVID-19 patients in the period between January to April 2022. We collected the demographic characteristics, the presence of comorbidities, the vaccination status, the clinical course (arterial blood gases and type of respiratory support) and outcomes (rate of tracheostomy, ICU length of stay and mortality). RESULTS: A total of 272 patients were admitted to ICUs during the study period. 161 patients were unvaccinated, whereas 111 were vaccinated with the complete first-cycle or "booster" dose. The type of respiratory support was similar between groups. Vaccinated patients were characterized by a better oxygenation throughout the whole ICU length of stay. Fourteen unvaccinated and 3 vaccinated patients required tracheostomy (p = 0.045). ICU length of stay was 12.2 (± 7.3) days in unvaccinated patients and 10.4 (± 6.7) days in vaccinated patients (p = 0.036). ICU mortalities were 38.5 and 24.3% in unvaccinated and vaccinated patients, respectively (p = 0.014). CONCLUSION: Vaccinated patients have better clinical course and outcomes as compared to the unvaccinated population."	"2296-858x

Vaccine effectiveness
mRNA vaccine"	"OBJECTIVES: The mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have shown high effectiveness in the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19, hospitalization, severe disease and death. Nevertheless, a minority of vaccinated individuals might become infected and experience significant morbidity. Characteristics of vaccine breakthrough infections have not been studied. We sought to portray the population of Israeli patients, who were hospitalized with COVID-19 despite full vaccination. METHODS: A retrospective multicentre cohort study of 17 hospitals included patients fully vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2 vaccine who developed COVID-19 more than 7 days after the second vaccine dose and required hospitalization. The risk for poor outcome, defined as a composite of mechanical ventilation or death, was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were included, accounting for half of hospitalized fully vaccinated patients in Israel. Poor outcome was noted in 38 patients and mortality rate reached 22% (34/152). Notably, the cohort was characterized by a high rate of co-morbidities predisposing to severe COVID-19, including hypertension (108; 71%), diabetes (73; 48%), congestive heart failure (41; 27%), chronic kidney and lung diseases (37; 24% each), dementia (29; 19%) and cancer (36; 24%), and only six (4%) had no co-morbidities. Sixty (40%) of the patients were immunocompromised. Higher viral load was associated with a significant risk for poor outcome. Risk also appeared higher in patients receiving anti-CD20 treatment and in patients with low titres of anti-Spike IgG, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: We found that severe COVID-19 infection, associated with a high mortality rate, might develop in a minority of fully vaccinated individuals with multiple co-morbidities. Our patients had a higher rate of co-morbidities and immunosuppression compared with previously reported non-vaccinated hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. Further characterization of this vulnerable population may help to develop guidance to augment their protection, either by continued social distancing, or by additional active or passive vaccinations."

Vaccine hesitancy"	"INTRODUCTION: More than two years after SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 has become one of the most severe pandemics in modern human history. Prior to the widespread availability of specific vaccines in 2021, public opinion surveys indicated significant vaccine hesitancy in 26 European countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epidemiological data on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality for 26 European countries were collected in November 2021 and compared with the proportions of people willing to receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine according to public opinion surveys analysed in 2020. Correlations between various variables were calculated using the Pearson correlation test and visualized with the R programming language. RESULTS: Paired Student's t-test revealed no significant differences between survey results and actual vaccination rates (p = 0.9546), suggesting that the polls were good predictors. The percentage of people willing to receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was significantly positively correlated with actual vaccination rates (R = 0.72, p = 0.00003) and significantly negatively correlated with the number of cumulative deaths per million people (R = -0.78, p = 0.0000024). However, there was no significant correlation with the number of cumulative cases per million people (R = -0.27, p = 0.18). These findings indicate that vaccines used in Europe were particularly effective at preventing severe COVID-19 and disease-related deaths, but did not necessarily provide strong protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection itself. CONCLUSION: Encouraging widespread immunization through vaccination was crucial for rapidly improving the epidemiological situation in Europe."	"2590-1362

*Skilled Nursing Facilities"	"Residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs), particularly those in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), have experienced disproportionately high levels of COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality and were prioritized for early COVID-19 vaccination (1,2). However, this group was not included in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, and limited postauthorization vaccine effectiveness (VE) data are available for this critical population (3). It is not known how well COVID-19 vaccines protect SNF residents, who typically are more medically frail, are older, and have more underlying medical conditions than the general population (1). In addition, immunogenicity of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was found to be lower in adults aged 65-85 years than in younger adults (4). Through the CDC Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program, SNF residents and staff members in Connecticut began receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on December 18, 2020 (5). Administration of the vaccine was conducted during several on-site pharmacy clinics. In late January 2021, the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CT DPH) identified two SNFs experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks among residents and staff members that occurred after each facility's first vaccination clinic. CT DPH, in partnership with CDC, performed electronic chart review in these facilities to obtain information on resident vaccination status and infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Partial vaccination, defined as the period from >14 days after the first dose through 7 days after the second dose, had an estimated effectiveness of 63% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 33%-79%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection (regardless of symptoms) among residents within these SNFs. This is similar to estimated effectiveness for a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in adults across a range of age groups in noncongregate settings (6) and suggests that to optimize vaccine impact among this population, high coverage with the complete 2-dose series should be recommended for SNF residents and staff members."

METHODS: Patients hospitalized at our center between January 2020 and April 2022 were attributed to subgroups depending on which SARS-CoV-2 variant was predominantly circulating in Germany: (i) Wild-type: January 1, 2020, to March 7, 2021, (ii) Alpha variant: August 3, 2021, to June 27, 2021, (iii) Delta variant: June 28, 2021, to December 26, 2021, and (iv) Omicron variant: December 27, 2021, to April 30, 2022. RESULTS: Between January 2020 and April 2022, 1500 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections were admitted to the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. The rate of patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) decreased from 31.2% (n = 223) in the wild-type group, 28.5% (n = 72) in the Alpha variant group, 18.8% (n = 67) in the Delta variant group, and 13.4% (n = 135) in the Omicron variant group. Also, in-hospital mortality decreased from 20.6% (n = 111) in the wild-type group, 17.5% (n = 30) in the Alpha variant group, 16.8% (n = 33) in the Delta variant group, and 6.6% (n = 39) in the Omicron variant group. The median duration of hospitalization was similar in all subgroups and ranged between 11 and 15 days throughout the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital mortality and rate of ICU admission among hospitalized COVID-19 patients steadily decreased throughout the pandemic. However, the practically unchanged duration of hospitalization demonstrates the persistent burden of COVID-19 on the healthcare system."	"1876-035x

METHODS: A Dynamic Causal Model was used to estimate key model parameters of the UK epidemic, such as vaccine effectiveness and increased transmissibility of Alpha and Delta variants, the effectiveness of the vaccine program roll-out and changes in contact rates. The model predicts the future trends in infections, long-COVID, hospital admissions and deaths. RESULTS: Two-dose vaccination given to 66% of the UK population prevents transmission following infection by 44%, serious illness by 86% and death by 93%. Despite this, with no other public health measures used, cases will increase from 37 million to 61 million, hospital admissions from 536,000 to 684,000 and deaths from 136,000 to 142,000 over 12 months. A retrospective analysis (conducted after the original submission of this report) allowed a comparison of these predictions of morbidity and mortality with actual outcomes. CONCLUSION: Vaccination alone will not control the epidemic. Relaxation of mitigating public health measures carries several risks, which include overwhelming the health services, the creation of vaccine resistant variants and the economic cost of huge numbers of acute and chronic cases."

Two doses of vaccines were administered to cancer patients which mainly received Pembrolizumab (51.1%). Respectively 78.2% and 62.2% of patients reported no adverse events after the first and the second dose regardless of the type of vaccine used.

Less is known about the safety of other COVID-19 vaccines or outcomes in younger populations. OBJECTIVE: To assess short-term risk for severe cardiovascular events (excluding myocarditis and pericarditis) after COVID-19 vaccination in France's 46.5 million adults younger than 75 years. DESIGN: Self-controlled case series method adapted to event-dependent exposure and high event-related mortality. SETTING: France, 27 December 2020 to 20 July 2021. PATIENTS: All adults younger than 75 years hospitalized for PE, acute MI, hemorrhagic stroke, or ischemic stroke (n = 73 325 total events). MEASUREMENTS: Linkage between the French National Health Data System and COVID-19 vaccine databases enabled identification of hospitalizations for cardiovascular events (MI, PE, or stroke) and receipt of a first or second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech, mRNA-1273 (Moderna), Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen), or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccine. The relative incidence (RI) of each cardiovascular event was estimated in the 3 weeks after vaccination compared with other periods, with adjustment for temporality (7-day periods). RESULTS: No association was found between the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine and severe cardiovascular events. The first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was associated with acute MI and PE in the second week after vaccination (RI, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.11 to 1.51] and 1.41 [CI, 1.13 to 1.75], respectively). An association with MI in the second week after a single dose of the Janssen vaccine could not be ruled out (RI, 1.75 [CI, 1.16 to 2.62]). LIMITATIONS: It was not possible to ascertain the relative timing of injection and cardiovascular events on the day of vaccination. Outpatient deaths related to cardiovascular events were not included. CONCLUSION: In persons aged 18 to 74 years, adenoviral-based vaccines may be associated with increased incidence of MI and PE. No association between mRNA-based vaccines and the cardiovascular events studied was observed. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None."	"1539-3704

Vaccination"	"BACKGROUND: Ethnic minority groups in England have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and have lower vaccination rates than the White British population. We examined whether ethnic differences in COVID-19 mortality in England have continued since the vaccine rollout and to what extent differences in vaccination rates contributed to excess COVID-19 mortality after accounting for other risk factors. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study of 28.8 million adults aged 30-100 years in England. Self-reported ethnicity was obtained from the 2011 Census. The outcome was death involving COVID-19 during the second (8 December 2020 to 12 June 2021) and third wave (13 June 2021 to 1 December 2021). We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for death involving COVID-19, sequentially adjusting for age, residence type, geographical factors, sociodemographic characteristics, pre-pandemic health, and vaccination status. RESULTS: Age-adjusted HRs of death involving COVID-19 were elevated for most ethnic minority groups during both waves, particularly for groups with lowest vaccination rates (Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Black African, and Black Caribbean). HRs were attenuated after adjusting for geographical factors, sociodemographic characteristics, and pre-pandemic health. Further adjusting for vaccination status substantially reduced residual HRs for Black African, Black Caribbean, and Pakistani groups in the third wave. Fully adjusted HRs only remained elevated for the Bangladeshi group (men: 2.19 [95% CI 1.72-2.78]; women: 2.12 [1.58-2.86]) and Pakistani men (1.24 [1.06-1.46]). CONCLUSIONS: Lower COVID-19 vaccination uptake in several ethnic minority groups may drive some of the differences in COVID-19 mortality compared to White British. Public health strategies to increase vaccination uptake in ethnic minority groups would help reduce inequalities in COVID-19 mortality, which have remained substantial since the start of the vaccination campaign."

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the Mulago National Referral Hospital CTU between May 1 and July 11, 2021. We performed Kaplan-Meier analysis to evaluate all-cause in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of the 477 participants, 247 (52%) were female, 15 (3%) had received at least 1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, and 223 (46%) had at least 1 comorbidity. The median age was 52 (interquartile range, 41-65) years. More than 80% of the patients presented with severe (19%, n=91) or critical (66%, n=315) COVID-19 illness. Overall, 174 (37%) patients died. Predictors of all-cause in-hospital mortality were as follows; age ≥50 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-3.2; P=.011), oxygen saturation at admission of ≥92% (aOR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.91-0.95; P<.001), and admission pulse rate of ≥100 beats per minute (aOR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; P=.042). The risk of death was 1.4-fold higher in female participants compared with their male counterparts (hazards ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-2.0; P=.025). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, where the majority of the patients presented with severe or critical illness, more than one third of the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at a national CTU died of the illness."

METHODS: We included LT patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab between March 1, 2020, and August 25, 2021 (n = 70). The study group was divided based on their vaccination status. RESULTS: During the study period, 14 fully vaccinated LT patients with one of the mRNA vaccines tested positive for COVID-19 (median age 54, range 30-62 years, M:F 9:5). The vaccinated cohort was younger with bilateral LT, have suppurative conditions as the transplant indication, and present with milder symptoms. However, pulmonary parenchymal involvement was seen among all 12 patients where computed tomography (CT) of chest was available. The laboratory profile indicated a more subdued inflammatory response among the vaccinated group. A lower proportion of vaccinated patients developed respiratory failure, needed ICU admission or ventilator support, although none of the differences achieved statistical significance. None of the vaccinated patients succumbed to COVID-19 during the study period, while the 4-week mortality among unvaccinated patients was nearly 15% (8/56). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of vaccinated LT patients who developed breakthrough COVID-19, the clinical course, risk of complications, and outcomes trended better than unvaccinated patients. However, universal involvement of the allograft demonstrates the continued vulnerability of these patients to significant sequelae from COVID-19. Future studies may evaluate the incremental protection of vaccination after the completion of the third dose of mRNA vaccines among LT patients."	"1399-3062

This led to development of vaccines within record time to combat morbidity and mortality associated with the virus. In Ghana, COVID-19 vaccines were introduced in addition to existing COVID-19 protocols. However, the vaccines have adverse events among those who received them. In this study, we determined the prevalence of some common adverse events of the COVID-19 vaccines and its associated sociodemographic factors in Ghana. METHODS: An online snowball cross-sectional survey was conducted between April and June 2021 among 240 people who had taken at least one dose of any of the COVID-19 vaccines approved in Ghana. The penalized binary logistic regression model was used to assess the factors associated with experience of at least one adverse event and the experience of number of adverse events using Stata version 16. RESULTS: Among the 240 participants, 88.2% had experienced at least one adverse event. The most common adverse event after the first dose was pain at injection site (65.8%), headache (57.5%), tiredness (55.8%), fever (51.7%), chills (39.6%), and muscle pains (38.3%). Experience of adverse events was 16 times higher among those who took their vaccines in Ghana (adjusted odd ratio [AOR]: 16.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.98-132.56, p = 0.009), 94% less among those who took AstraZeneca (India) compared to AstraZeneca (Oxford) (AOR: 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01-0.37, p = 0.002) and 86% less among 40-49 years compared with less than 30 years old (AOR: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.03-0.58, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Pain at the injection site, headache, tiredness, fever, chills, and muscle pains were the most frequently reported adverse events. The study identified country of vaccination, country of origin of AstraZeneca vaccine and age to be associated with adverse events of vaccination."	"2398-8835

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stay in hospital, intensive care unit admission, use of ventilation, and mortality measured 30 days after a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: In the delta period, 95 336 patients had infections with 47.6% having at least one vaccine dose, compared with 184 653 patients in the omicron period, with 72.6% vaccinated. After adjustment for patient demographic and clinical characteristics, in the delta period, two doses of the mRNA vaccines were associated with lower odds of hospital admission (adjusted odds ratio 0.41 (95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.43)), intensive care unit admission (0.33 (0.31 to 0.36)), ventilation (0.27 (0.24 to 0.30)), and death (0.21 (0.19 to 0.23)), compared with no vaccination. In the omicron period, receipt of two mRNA doses were associated with lower odds of hospital admission (0.60 (0.57 to 0.63)), intensive care unit admission (0.57 (0.53 to 0.62)), ventilation (0.59 (0.51 to 0.67)), and death (0.43 (0.39 to 0.48)). Additionally, a third mRNA dose was associated with lower odds of all outcomes compared with two doses: hospital admission (0.65 (0.63 to 0.69)), intensive care unit admission (0.65 (0.59 to 0.70)), ventilation (0.70 (0.61 to 0.80)), and death (0.51 (0.46 to 0.57)). The Ad26.COV2.S vaccination was associated with better outcomes relative to no vaccination, but higher odds of hospital stay and intensive care unit admission than with two mRNA doses. BNT162b2 was generally associated with worse outcomes than mRNA-1273 (adjusted odds ratios between 0.97 and 1.42). CONCLUSIONS: In veterans with recent healthcare use and high occurrence of multimorbidity, vaccination was robustly associated with lower odds of 30 day morbidity and mortality compared with no vaccination among patients infected with covid-19. The vaccination type and number of doses had a significant association with outcomes."	"1756-1833

We estimated the real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in a large international cohort of hemodialysis patients. METHODS: In this historical, 1:1 matched cohort study, we included adult hemodialysis patients receiving treatment from December 1, 2020, to May 31, 2021. For each vaccinated patient, an unvaccinated control was selected among patients registered in the same country and attending a dialysis session around the first vaccination date. Matching was based on demographics, clinical characteristics, past COVID-19 infections and a risk score representing the local background risk of infection at vaccination dates. We estimated the effectiveness of mRNA and viral-carrier COVID-19 vaccines in preventing infection and mortality rates from a time-dependent Cox regression stratified by country. RESULTS: In the effectiveness analysis concerning mRNA vaccines, we observed 850 SARS-CoV-2 infections and 201 COVID-19 related deaths among the 28110 patients during a mean follow up of 44 ± 40 days. In the effectiveness analysis concerning viral-carrier vaccines, we observed 297 SARS-CoV-2 infections and 64 COVID-19 related deaths among 12888 patients during a mean follow up of 48 ± 32 days. We observed 18.5/100-patient-year and 8.5/100-patient-year fewer infections and 5.4/100-patient-year and 5.2/100-patient-year fewer COVID-19 related deaths among patients vaccinated with mRNA and viral-carrier vaccines respectively, compared to matched unvaccinated controls. Estimated vaccine effectiveness at days 15, 30, 60 and 90 after the first dose of a mRNA vaccine was: for infection, 41.3%, 54.5%, 72.6% and 83.5% and, for death, 33.1%, 55.4%, 80.1% and 91.2%. Estimated vaccine effectiveness after the first dose of a viral-carrier vaccine was: for infection, 38.3% without increasing over time and, for death, 56.6%, 75.3%, 92.0% and 97.4%. CONCLUSION: In this large, real-world cohort of hemodialyzed patients, mRNA and viral-carrier COVID-19 vaccines were associated with reduced COVID-19 related mortality. Additionally, we observed a strong reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hemodialysis patients receiving mRNA vaccines."	"2813-0626

However, estimating vaccine effectiveness using observational data is inherently challenging because of the nonrandomized design and potential for unmeasured confounding. We used a regression discontinuity design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 mortality in England using the fact that people aged 80 years or older were prioritized for the vaccine rollout. The prioritization led to a large discrepancy in vaccination rates among people aged 80-84 years compared with those aged 75-79 at the beginning of the vaccination campaign. We found a corresponding difference in COVID-19 mortality but not in non-COVID-19 mortality, suggesting that our approach appropriately addressed the issue of unmeasured confounding factors. Our results suggest that the first vaccine dose reduced the risk of COVID-19 death by 52.6% (95% confidence limits: 15.7, 73.4) in those aged 80 years, supporting existing evidence that a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine had a strong protective effect against COVID-19 mortality in older adults. The regression discontinuity model's estimate of vaccine effectiveness is only slightly lower than those of previously published studies using different methods, suggesting that these estimates are unlikely to be substantially affected by unmeasured confounding factors."

METHODS: We included all individuals registered in the Madrid Health System Registry as of 31 December 2019, and followed them until 31 December 2022. Using a unique personal identifier, we linked the databases of primary care, hospitals, pharmacies, certified laboratories performing diagnostic tests, vaccines, and mortality. RESULTS: Of 6 833 423 individuals, 21.4% had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, and 1.5% had a COVID-19 hospitalization (primary diagnosis). Thirty-day mortality was 1.6% for confirmed COVID-19 (from 11.4% in first semester 2020 to 0.4% in first semester 2022). Thirty-day mortality was 10.8% for COVID-19 hospitalizations (from 14.0% in first semester 2020 to 6.0% in second semester 2022). There were 24 073 deaths within 30 days of a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Advanced age, male sex, higher socioeconomic deprivation, and comorbidities were associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSIONS: By linking administrative and clinical databases, we characterized the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in Madrid over 3 years. Our analysis proposes a high-level framework for comparisons of the burden of COVID-19 across areas worldwide."	"2328-8957

However, these trials have not reported data regarding the subgroup of liver disease or excluded patients with liver disease. The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines among liver cirrhosis (LC) patients is unclear. We conducted this meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in LC patients. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to include all the relevant studies that compared the outcomes of LC patients who received SARS-CoV-2 vaccines vs. unvaccinated patients. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by the Mantel-Haenszel method within a random-effect model. Four studies with 51,834 LC patients (20,689 patients received at least one dose vs 31,145 were unvaccinated) were included. COVID-19-related complications, including hospitalization (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59-0.91, P = 0.004), mortality (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.16-0.55, P = 0.0001), and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11-0.77, P = 0.01), were significantly lower in the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in LC patients reduced COVID-19-related mortality, intubation, and hospitalization. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is highly effective in LC. Further prospective studies, preferably randomized controlled trials, are necessary to validate our findings and determine which vaccine is superior in patients with LC."	"1525-3252

Vaccine effectiveness"	"OBJECTIVES: Vaccination has been effective in ameliorating the impact of COVID-19. Here, we report vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the nationally available COVID-19 vaccines in Mexico. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a COVID-19 surveillance system to assess the VE of the BNT162b2, messenger RNA (mRNA)-12732, Gam-COVID-Vac, Ad5-nCoV, Ad26.COV2.S, ChAdOx1, and CoronaVac vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and death in Mexico. The VE was estimated using time-varying Cox proportional hazard models in vaccinated and unvaccinated adults, adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities. VE was also estimated for adults with diabetes, aged ≥60 years, and comparing the predominance of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.519 and B.1.617.2. RESULTS: We assessed 793,487 vaccinated and 4,792,338 unvaccinated adults between December 24, 2020 and September 27, 2021. The VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection was the highest for fully vaccinated individuals with mRNA-12732 (91.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 90.3-92.4) and Ad26.COV2.S (82.2%, 95% CI 81.4-82.9); for COVID-19 hospitalization, BNT162b2 (84.3%, 95% CI 83.6-84.9) and Gam-COVID-Vac (81.4% 95% CI 79.5-83.1), and for mortality, BNT162b2 (89.8%, 95% CI 89.2-90.2) and mRNA-12732 (93.5%, 95% CI 86.0-97.0). The VE decreased for all vaccines in adults aged ≥60 years, people with diabetes, and periods of Delta variant predominance. CONCLUSION: All the vaccines implemented in Mexico were effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and death. Mass vaccination with multiple vaccines is useful to maximize vaccination coverage."	"1878-3511

We investigated the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on the incidence of infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The study design was an observational data linkage cohort study. Multiple health care datasets were linked to ascertain all SARS-CoV-2 testing, vaccination, hospitalization, and mortality data for all patients treated with KRT in Scotland from the start of the pandemic over a period of 20 months. Descriptive statistics, survival analyses, and vaccine effectiveness were calculated. RESULTS: As of September 19, 2021, 93% (n=5281) of the established KRT population in Scotland had received two doses of an approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Over the study period, there were 814 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (15.1% of the KRT population). Vaccine effectiveness rates against infection and hospitalization were 33% (95% CI, 0 to 52) and 38% (95% CI, 0 to 57), respectively. Within 28 days of a SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR test, 9.2% of fully vaccinated individuals died (7% patients on dialysis and 10% kidney transplant recipients). This compares to <0.1% of the vaccinated general Scottish population admitted to the hospital or dying due to COVID-19 during that period. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that a primary vaccine course of two doses has limited effect on COVID-19 infection and its complications in patients with KRT. Adjunctive strategies to reduce risk of both COVID-19 infection and its complications in this population are urgently required."	"1533-3450

Vaccine breakthrough"	"BACKGROUND: UK COVID-19 vaccination policy has evolved to offering COVID-19 booster doses to individuals at increased risk of severe Illness from COVID-19. Building on our analyses of vaccine effectiveness of first, second and initial booster doses, we aimed to identify individuals at increased risk of severe outcomes (i.e., COVID-19 related hospitalisation or death) post the autumn 2022 booster dose. METHODS: We undertook a national population-based cohort analysis across all four UK nations through linked primary care, vaccination, hospitalisation and mortality data. We included individuals who received autumn 2022 booster doses of BNT162b2 (Comirnaty) or mRNA-1273 (Spikevax) during the period September 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 to investigate the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between demographic and clinical factors and severe COVID-19 outcomes after the autumn booster dose. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), deprivation, urban/rural areas and comorbidities. Stratified analyses were conducted by vaccine type. We then conducted a fixed-effect meta-analysis to combine results across the four UK nations. FINDINGS: Between September 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022, 7,451,890 individuals ≥18 years received an autumn booster dose. 3500 had severe COVID-19 outcomes (2.9 events per 1000 person-years). Being male (male vs female, aHR 1.41 (1.32-1.51)), older adults (≥80 years vs 18-49 years; 10.43 (8.06-13.50)), underweight (BMI <18.5 vs BMI 25.0-29.9; 2.94 (2.51-3.44)), those with comorbidities (≥5 comorbidities vs none; 9.45 (8.15-10.96)) had a higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation or death after the autumn booster dose. Those with a larger household size (≥11 people within household vs 2 people; 1.56 (1.23-1.98)) and from more deprived areas (most deprived vs least deprived quintile; 1.35 (1.21-1.51)) had modestly higher risks. We also observed at least a two-fold increase in risk for those with various chronic neurological conditions, including Down's syndrome, immunodeficiency, chronic kidney disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, or cardiovascular disease. INTERPRETATION: Males, older individuals, underweight individuals, those with an increasing number of comorbidities, from a larger household or more deprived areas, and those with specific underlying health conditions remained at increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation and death after the autumn 2022 vaccine booster dose. There is now a need to focus on these risk groups for investigating immunogenicity and efficacy of further booster doses or therapeutics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from Mexico's Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Disease (Sisver) and the design of the vaccine policy in Mexico as a natural experiment, we applied difference-in-differences econometric methods to assess the strategy's effectiveness on transmission, hospitalizations, and mortality rates among adults 60 to 64 years old in Mexico between April and June 2021. RESULTS: We estimated average effectiveness levels of 60.9% against confirmed cases of Covid-19. Vaccination also decreased hospitalizations and deaths by 62.7 and 62.6%, respectively. After adjusting for vaccination coverage, we found an impact of 79.1, 80.9, and 81.3% reduction in new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among the vaccinated. CONCLUSION: Despite the significant progress in our knowledge of Covid-19 vaccination effectiveness, the available evidence relies mostly on experiences from high-income countries. This study contributes to the scientific literature of Covid-19 vaccination effectiveness in a middle-income country with a multi-vaccine scheme."	"1606-7916

Objective To identify the socio-demographic factors, clinical features, and outcomes in both vaccinated and unvaccinated hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Method Socio-demographic details, clinical features, and the outcomes among fully vaccinated (double for Covishield/AstraZeneca and BBIBP-CorV and single for Janssen), partially vaccinated, and unvaccinated hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) were collected and analyzed using SPSS version 17. Result Among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n=299), 175 (58.5%) patients received a single-dose, 82 (27.4%) double-dose, and 124 (41.5%) did not receive any dose of the COVID-19 vaccines. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients was found to be associated among professional degree holders (23.4% versus 9.7%) (p<0.05), professional workers (43.4% vs. 25.0%) (p<0.05), hospitalization to general ward (76.6% vs. 72.6%) (p<0.05), and presence of multiple symptoms (> or equel 3) (86.8% vs. 75.0%) (p>0.05) and comorbidities (> or equal 2) (15.5% vs. 13.7%) (p>0.05). Despite such approximate incidences, the risk of in-hospital mortality among the vaccinated patients was reduced (0.6% vs. 3.2%) (p>0.05), when compared to the unvaccinated patients. The risk of in-hospital mortality was associated with the older age and the presence of multiple comorbidities including bronchial asthma, diabetes, and hypertension. Conclusion Full or partial vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns might be effective in preventing in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients."	"1812-2078

These deposits can lead to severe organ dysfunction e.g. in the myocardium with great impact on prognosis. The Covid-19 pandemic has caused excess mortality worldwide since 2020. Risk factors for a severe course include pre-existing cardiac diseases like heart failure and advanced age. Therefore, vaccination against Sars-CoV2 viruses is highly recommended for patients with cardiac amyloidosis. However, since there are no specific data on mRNA vaccines in patients with cardiac amyloidosis, some patients have concerns about cardiac adverse events following immunization (AEFI), such as myocarditis. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines in patients with cardiac amyloidosis. METHODS: Patients of the Amyloidosis Center Charité Berlin (ACCB) were assessed about the vaccination, its tolerability and clinical effectiveness. To date, we included 62 patients (54 men) with a median age of 82,5 years (range 37 to 92). 46 patients had wtATTR amyloidosis, ten patients had hATTR amyloidosis, and six patients had AL amyloidosis. The mean systolic left ventricular function was 51% (range 30 to 62) with a mean global strain of -11,5% (range -18,5 to -3,1). The mean NT-pro-BNP was 1145 ng/l (range 24 to 48297). RESULTS: 59 patients were triple vaccinated and three patients so far are double vaccinated. Three of the patients were unvaccinated. 171 of the vaccine doses administered were mRNA vaccines and eight doses were a viral vector-vaccine. None of the patients reported severe side effects. Thirteen patients reported feeling of pressure and pain at the injection site after vaccination and four patients had fever of maximum two days, eight patients reported lower general condition of maximum five days. One patient reported malaise for 14 days after each vaccination, which resolved spontaneously. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of suspected vaccine-induced myocarditis. Five patients reported of a COVID-19 breakthrough infection, all of which with a mild course of disease. None of the patients had symptoms of worsening heart failure in temporal relation to the vaccination. Most of the vaccinations (103) were performed at an official vaccination center, 59 were performed at a general practitioner. CONCLUSION: In patients with cardiac amyloidosis, mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 are safe with respect to severe cardiac adverse events and show effective protection against clinically relevant SARS-CoV2 infection."

METHODS: In this population-based retrospective observational study, data on all PLWMS, vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 tests, hospitalization, and deaths were collected in Isfahan, Iran between February 9, 2021, and November 4, 2021. We estimated the hazard ratio between vaccinated (partially and fully) and unvaccinated groups using the Andersen-Gill extension of the Cox proportional hazards model. We also performed Cox proportional hazards analysis to identify risk factors for breakthrough infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization in fully-immunized group. RESULTS: Of the 9869 PLWMS, 1368 were in partially-vaccinated group, 4107 were in the fully-vaccinated group, and 3794 were in the unvaccinated group. In the partially-vaccinated group, the estimated VE against COVID-19 infection was 39.3% (16%, 56.1%), hospitalization was 64.9% (1.3%, 87.5%), and mortality was 92.7% (88.8%, 100%). The respective results for the fully-vaccinated group were 63.9% (56%, 70.3%), 75.7% (57.5%, 86.1%), and 100%. Progressive MS was independently associated with a greater risk of breakthrough infection (HR=1.952, 95%CI: 1.174-3.246, p = 0.010). Older adults (≥50 years vs. 18-49 years, HR=3.115, 95%CI: 1.145-8.470, p = 0.026) and those on rituximab (HR=7.584; 95% CI: 1.864-30.854; p = 0.005) were at an increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization. CONCLUSION: This study showed that two doses of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine can effectively prevent COVID-19 infection and hospitalization among PLWMS. Old PLWMS and those who treating with rituximab are at increased risk of hospitalization after receiving two doses of the vaccine."	"2211-0356

This study uses cross-state regressions to assess impacts of vaccinations on COVID outcomes. A number of familiar issues arise concerning cross-sectional regressions, including omitted variables, behavioral responses to vaccination, and reverse causation. The benefits from a field context and from the broad range of observed variations suggest the value from dealing with these issues. Results reveal sizable negative effects of vaccination on deaths, hospitalizations, and cases up to early December 2021, although vaccine efficacy seems to wane over time. The findings for deaths apply to all-cause excess mortality as well as COVID-related mortality. The estimates imply that one expected life saved requires 248 additional doses, with a marginal cost around $55000, far below typical estimates of the value of a statistical life. Results since December 2021 suggest smaller effects of vaccinations on deaths and, especially, hospitalizations and cases, possibly because of diminished effectiveness of vaccines against new forms of the virus, notably the omicron variant. A further possibility is that confidence engendered by vaccinations motivated individuals and governments to lessen non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as masking and social distancing."

METHODS: We extracted data for the period from July 30 to October 10, 2021, from the Israel Ministry of Health database regarding 4,696,865 persons 16 years of age or older who had received two doses of BNT162b2 at least 5 months earlier. In the primary analysis, we compared the rates of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), severe illness, and death among those who had received a booster dose at least 12 days earlier (booster group) with the rates among those who had not received a booster (nonbooster group). In a secondary analysis, we compared the rates in the booster group with the rates among those who had received a booster 3 to 7 days earlier (early postbooster group). We used Poisson regression models to estimate rate ratios after adjusting for possible confounding factors. RESULTS: The rate of confirmed infection was lower in the booster group than in the nonbooster group by a factor of approximately 10 (range across five age groups, 9.0 to 17.2) and was lower in the booster group than in the early postbooster group by a factor of 4.9 to 10.8. The adjusted rate difference ranged from 57.0 to 89.5 infections per 100,000 person-days in the primary analysis and from 34.4 to 38.3 in the secondary analysis. The rates of severe illness in the primary and secondary analyses were lower in the booster group by a factor of 17.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.1 to 21.2) and 6.5 (95% CI, 5.1 to 8.2), respectively, among those 60 years of age or older and by a factor of 21.7 (95% CI, 10.6 to 44.2) and 3.7 (95% CI, 1.3 to 10.2) among those 40 to 59 years of age. The adjusted rate difference in the primary and secondary analyses was 5.4 and 1.9 cases of severe illness per 100,000 person-days among those 60 years of age or older and 0.6 and 0.1 among those 40 to 59 years of age. Among those 60 years of age or older, mortality was lower by a factor of 14.7 (95% CI, 10.0 to 21.4) in the primary analysis and 4.9 (95% CI, 3.1 to 7.9) in the secondary analysis. The adjusted rate difference in the primary and secondary analyses was 2.1 and 0.8 deaths per 100,000 person-days. CONCLUSIONS: Across the age groups studied, rates of confirmed Covid-19 and severe illness were substantially lower among participants who received a booster dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine than among those who did not."

First, we attempted to understand the association between the COVID-19 transmission rate, environmental factors (air pollution, weather, mobility), and socio-political parameters (Government Stringency Index, GSI). Second, we evaluated the efficiency of various strategies, including radical opening, intermittent lockdown, phase lift, and contact tracing, to exit the COVID-19 pandemic and get back to pre-pandemic conditions using a stochastic individual-based epidemiology model. Third, we used a deep learning approach and simulated the vaccination rate and the time for reaching herd immunity. The analysis was done based on the collected data from eight countries in Asia, including Iran, Turkey, India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, South Korea, and Russia (as a transcontinental country). Our findings in the first part highlighted a noninfluential impact from the weather-driven parameters and short-term exposure to pollutants on the transmission rate; however, long-term exposure could potentially increase the risk of COVID-19 mortality rates (based on 1998-2017 p.m.2.5 data). Mobility was highly correlated with the COVID-19 transmission and based on our causal analysis reducing mobility could curb the COVID-19 transmission rate with a 6-day lag time (on average). Secondly, among all the tested policies for exiting the COVID-19 pandemic, the contact tracing was the most efficient if executed correctly. With a 2-day delay in tracing the virus hosts, a 60% successful host tracing, and a 70% contact reduction with the hosts, a pandemic will end in a year without overburdening a healthcare system with 6000 hospital beds capacity per million. Lastly, our vaccine simulations showed that the target date for achieving herd immunity significantly varied among the countries and could be delayed to October-november 2022 in countries like India and Iran (based on 60% immunized population and assuming no intermediate factors affecting the vaccination rate)."

METHODS: We matched 119 cases of post-vaccination severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection with BNT162b2 mRNA or ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 to 476 unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 (September 2020-March 2021) according to age and sex. Differences in 60-day all-cause mortality, hospital admission, and hospital length of stay were evaluated. Phylogenetic, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and minority variant allele (MVA) full-genome sequencing analysis was performed. RESULTS: Overall, 116 of 119 cases developed COVID-19 post-first vaccination dose (median, 14 days). Thirteen of 119 (10.9%) cases and 158 of 476 (33.2%) controls died (P < .001), corresponding to the 4.5 number needed to treat (NNT). Multivariably, vaccination was associated with a 69.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 45.8 to 82.6) relative risk (RR) reduction in mortality. Similar results were seen in subgroup analysis for patients with infection onset ≥14 days after first vaccination and across vaccine subgroups. Hospital admissions (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI: .51 to 1.28) and length of stay (-1.89 days; 95% CI: -4.57 to 0.78) were lower for cases, while cycle threshold values were higher (30.8 vs 28.8, P = .053). B.1.1.7 was the predominant lineage in cases (100 of 108, 92.6%) and controls (341 of 446, 76.5%). Genomic analysis identified 1 post-vaccination case that harbored the E484K vaccine-escape mutation (B.1.525 lineage). CONCLUSIONS: Previous vaccination reduces mortality when B.1.1.7 is the predominant lineage. No significant lineage-specific genomic changes during phylogenetic, SNP, and MVA analysis were detected."

SARS-CoV-2 vaccination"	"PURPOSE: Vaccinations, for example flu vaccine, may be a cause of cross-reactive immunostimulation that prevents a larger spectrum of infections. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations may also determine this effect is unclear. This study aims, first, to assess the incidence of infections at hospital admission and during the hospitalization in older inpatients vaccinated and unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2; second, to compare length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. METHODS: This retrospective study included 754 older inpatients admitted to the Geriatrics and Orthogeriatrics Units of the University Hospital of Ferrara (Italy) between March 2021 and November 2021. Sociodemographic and health-related data, and the diagnosis of infections at hospital admission and during hospitalization were collected from medical records. RESULTS: The sample's mean age was 87.2 years, 59.2% were females, and 75.5% were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccinated individuals had 36% lower odds of intra-hospital infections (OR = 0.64, 95%CI 0.44-0.94) and 39% lower in-hospital death (HR = 0.61, 95%CI 0.39-0.95), also after adjusting for potential confounders, while no significant results emerged about infections at hospital admission. Considering the hospitalization's endpoints, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was associated with a lower probability of being transferred to long-term care or other hospital departments than returning home (OR = 0.63, 95%CI 0.40-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: In older inpatients, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination seems to be associated with a lower likelihood of intra-hospital infectious diseases not caused by SARS-CoV-2 and all-cause in-hospital mortality. The vaccination coverage in the older population could limit not only the onset and severity of COVID-19 but also the occurrence of other infectious diseases."	"Balducci, Marco

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 vaccination influences hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19 in this population. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of administrative data extracted from the Greek nationwide database that holds the COVID-19 disease and vaccination registry, as well as all medical prescription records. The study period extended from the onset of the pandemic (February 2020) until the 10th of January 2022. RESULTS: We identified 278 people with myasthenia gravis (mean age 58.1 ± 17.2, 47.5% males) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of those, 139 (50%) were not vaccinated at the time of infection. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis showed that the probability of hospitalization increased with age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.058; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.036-1.080; p < .001) and immunosuppressive treatment (OR: 2.872; 95% CI 1.412-5.839; p = .004), and decreased with vaccination (OR: 0.244; 95% CI 0.132-0.453; p < .001). The probability of a fatal outcome increased with age (OR: 1.085; 95% CI 1.043-1.129; p < .001) and decreased with vaccination (OR: 0.315; 95% CI 0.125-0.791; p = .014). DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination significantly reduces hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19 in people with myasthenia gravis. This study regarding the efficacy of these vaccines, together with previous studies regarding their safety, provide evidence to support their use in people with myasthenia gravis."	"1097-4598

The mortality rate of critically ill COVID-19 patients is high. OBJECTIVE: To assess the severity, different clinical symptoms, and comorbidities of COVID-19 pneumonia in vaccinated vs. non-vaccinated patients. METHODS: In this single-center, cross-sectional study, 142 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The clinical characteristics, comorbidities, severity, and outcomes were also assessed. RESULTS: Of the 142 patients, 92 (64.8%) were males, with a mean age of (56.00±14.81) years. Among them, 62 (43.7%) were aged above 60 years. Of these, 92 (64.7%) had comorbidities. The patients were divided into two groups: unvaccinated and those who received at least one dose of the vaccine within six months. The demographic characteristics of the two groups were similar except for gender. In the vaccinated group, most of the patients were males. Most patients in the non-vaccinated group had a severe illness, whereas most patients in the vaccinated group had mild to moderate disease. Only 26% of the vaccinated group experienced severe illness compared to 71.5% in the unvaccinated group. In addition, the all-cause 30-day mortality in the non-vaccinated population was higher than that in the vaccinated population. However, this difference was not statistically significant (12.5% vs. 7.1%). On the contrary, there was no difference in the length of the intensive care unit or total hospital stay between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19 had the worst outcome in the unvaccinated patients. Most partially vaccinated patients got infected before developing immunity, and a small percentage of completely immunized patients who were infected were likely non-responders. Receiving at least one vaccination dose significantly reduced illness severity."	"2168-8184

We sought to evaluate cardiac complications associated with COVID-19 vaccination in a pooled analysis from our institution's cohort study and systematic review. Consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in Singapore between 1 January 2021 and 31 March 2021, with the onset of cardiac manifestations within 14 days following COVID-19 vaccination, were studied. Furthermore, a systematic review was performed, with PubMed, Embase, Research Square, MedRxiv and LitCovid databases accessed from inception up to 29 June 2021. Relevant manuscripts reporting individual patient data on cardiac complications following COVID-19 vaccination were included. Thirty patients were included in the study cohort, with 29 diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 1 with myocarditis. Five patients developed heart failure, two had cardiogenic shock, three intubated, and one had cardiovascular-related mortality. In the systematic review, 16 studies were included with 41 myocarditis and 6 AMI cases. In the pooled analysis of the study cohort and the systematic review, 35 patients had AMI and 42 had myocarditis. Majority were men, and myocarditis patients were younger than AMI patients. Myocarditis patients tended to present 72 h postvaccination, while AMI patients were older and typically presented 24 h postvaccination. Majority with AMI or myocarditis developed symptoms after the first and second vaccination dose, respectively. This pooled analysis of patients presenting with cardiac manifestations following COVID-19 vaccination highlights the differences between myocarditis and AMI presentations in temporal association with the vaccination."

METHODOLOGY: A total of 260 patients who underwent kidney transplantation between June 2012 and May 2022 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients chose vaccination Sinovac-CoronaVac (CoronaVac) and/or BNT162b2 (Biontech), the first vaccine available in the country) in line with the regulations and recommendations of the Ministry of Health. The relationship between vaccination, hospitalization, and mortality in cases diagnosed with COVID-19 was investigated. The prevalence of COVID-19 in patients, the rate of hospital admission, and the mortality of patients before and after the national vaccination program were examined. RESULTS: The study included a total of 260 kidney transplant patients (Female, n = 107 (41%); male, n = 153 (59%). The mean age of patients was 38.42 (11-75). A total of 108 (41.5%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Seven (6.5%) patients died and 221 (85%) patients were vaccinated after the national vaccination program. During the follow-up period, 108 (41.5%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. There was no significant difference in terms of hospitalization between two groups. However, there was a significant difference in terms of admission to intensive care unit and mortality (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of cases that died were unvaccinated. However, repeated vaccinations may not adequately protect all transplant recipients. There is a need to develop personalized treatment and prevention strategies in transplantation cases."	"1972-2680

Comparisons of mortality rates between more and less vaccinated groups may be misleading due to selection bias, as these groups may differ in underlying health status. We studied all adult deaths during the period of 1 April 2021-30 June 2022 in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, linked to vaccination records, and we used mortality from other natural causes to proxy for underlying health. We report relative COVID-19 mortality risk (RMR) for those vaccinated with two and three doses versus the unvaccinated, using a novel outcome measure that controls for selection effects. This measure, COVID Excess Mortality Percentage (CEMP), uses the non-COVID natural mortality rate (Non-COVID-NMR) as a measure of population risk of COVID mortality without vaccination. We validate this measure during the pre-vaccine period (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.97) and demonstrate that selection effects are large, with non-COVID-NMRs for two-dose vaccinees often less than half those for the unvaccinated, and non-COVID NMRs often still lower for three-dose (booster) recipients. Progressive waning of two-dose effectiveness is observed, with an RMR of 10.6% for two-dose vaccinees aged 60+ versus the unvaccinated during April-June 2021, rising steadily to 36.2% during the Omicron period (January-June, 2022). A booster dose reduced RMR to 9.5% and 10.8% for ages 60+ during the two periods when boosters were available (October-December, 2021; January-June, 2022). Boosters thus provide important additional protection against mortality."	"2076-393x

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (anti-S MoAbs) appear promising in this setting. We report a monocentric retrospective study including 176 patients affected by lymphoma which developed SARS-CoV-2 infection since the start of COVID19 pandemic. Overall, mortality was 13.1%, with a decreasing trend between first waves to the last wave of pandemic (18.5% vs. 9.4%, p 0.076). Patients receiving anti-S MoAbs (41.3%) showed inferior mortality rate (overall survival, OS 93.2% vs. 82.7%, p 0.025) with no serious toxicity, reduced documented pneumonia (26% vs. 33%, p 0.005), and reduced need of oxygen support (14.5% vs. 35.7%, p 0.003). Among patients who received 3 doses of vaccine, the employment of anti-COVID MoAbs showed a trend of superior survival versus those who did not receive Anti-S MoAbs (OS rates 97.3% vs. 84.2%, p 0.064). On multivariate analysis, active haematological disease (OS 72% (HR 2.49 CI 1.00-6.41), bendamustine exposure (OS 60% HR 4.2 CI 1.69-10.45) and at least one comorbidity (HR 6.53 CI 1.88-22.60) were independent prognostic factors for death. Our study confirms the adverse prognostic role of COVID-19 in lymphoma patients in presence of active disease, comorbidities and previous exposure to bendamustine. In our experience, anti-S MoAbs represented a therapeutic option in vaccinated patients."	"1099-1069

The goal of this study was to see if there was an association between disease progression in admitted COVID-19 patients and their prior vaccination exposure. A prospective cohort study based on 1640 admitted COVID-19 patients were carried between June 2021 and October 2021. Depending on vaccination exposure they were divided into vaccinated (exposed) and unvaccinated (unexposed) groups, excluding partially vaccinated patients. Disease severity was assessed at admission on severity index scale. Disease progression to mortality or need of mechanical ventilation and survival were taken as outcome. Absolute difference with 95%CI and Risk Ratio were calculated using cross tabulation, Chi square test and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Among 1514 total analyzed cohort (median age, 53 years [IQR, 17,106]; 43.7% from 46 to 65 years of age group, 56.2% males,33.4% with no comorbid factor for disease progression) 369(24.4%) were vaccinated breakthrough cases and 1145(75.6%) were unvaccinated controls. 556(36.7%) progressed to death or mechanical ventilation, 958(63.3%) patients survived and were discharged home. Disease progression to death or mechanical ventilation was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (24.9% among vaccinated breakthrough vs 40.5% unvaccinated controls, [Absolute difference -15.6% 95%CI (-10.2% to -20.6%); RR 0.615 95%CI (0.509, 0.744); p <.001]). This association was stronger for old age population and for increase time span between second dose of vaccine and onset of symptoms. There was no statistically significant difference among different types of vaccination and occurrence of outcome when compared to unvaccinated controls (RR 0.607(0.482, 0.763); 0.673(0.339, 1.33) and 0.623(0.441, 0.881) for Inactivated virus vaccine, mRNA and Adenovirus vector-based vaccine respectively. The patients who were fully vaccinated against SARS-COV-2 die or shift to mechanical ventilation less frequently than unvaccinated COVID-19 admitted patients."	"2213-7106

SARS-CoV-2"	"The rapid emergence of the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant of SARS-CoV-2 led to a global resurgence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Israeli authorities approved a fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose (second booster) for individuals aged 60 years and over who had received a first booster dose 4 or more months earlier. Evidence for the effectiveness of a second booster dose in reducing hospitalizations and mortality due to COVID-19 is warranted. This retrospective cohort study included all members of Clalit Health Services who were aged 60-100 years and who were eligible for the second booster on 3 January 2022. Hospitalizations and mortality due to COVID-19 in participants who received the second booster were compared with those for participants who received one booster dose. Cox proportional hazards regression models with time-dependent covariates were used to estimate the association between the second booster and hospitalization and death due to COVID-19 while adjusting for demographic factors and coexisting illnesses. A total of 563,465 participants met the eligibility criteria. Of those, 328,597 (58%) received a second booster dose during the 40 day study period. Hospitalization due to COVID-19 occurred in 270 of the second-booster recipients and in 550 participants who received one booster dose (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.31-0.43). Death due to COVID-19 occurred in 92 second-booster recipients and in 232 participants who received one booster dose (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.22; 95% CI: 0.17-0.28). This study demonstrates a substantial reduction in hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19 conferred by a second booster in Israeli adults aged 60 years and over."	"1546-170x

At the same time, government stringency measures in terms of closing public life were decreased. Our objective was to estimate the total number of Covid-19 deaths avoided due to the massive vaccination campaign in the elderly Israeli population. METHODS: We examined the effect of vaccination on mortality when at least 90% of the population over age 70 were vaccinated for less than seven months. Projected deaths as expected from vaccine efficacy and actual mortality data were compared for the study population to account for potential confounding effects of government stringency. The average Oxford Stringency Index was calculated in the study period and the preceding period of the pandemic. Potential confounding effects of an age shift in the distribution of deaths were examined by analyzing the distributions before and after the study period. RESULTS: Confirmed deaths from COVID-19 in the population over 70 after mass vaccination were recorded as 370, versus 5,120 estimated without vaccinations. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccines against COVID-19 saved more lives than expected by simply applying individual vaccine efficacy to the vaccinated population in Israel, despite a loosening of government stringency. Our findings support the worldwide efforts of governments to improve vaccination rates, especially in the elderly population."	"1527-3296

On July 30, 2021, the Israeli Ministry of Health approved the use of a third dose of BNT162b2 (booster) to cope with this resurgence. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of the booster in lowering mortality due to Covid-19 is still needed. METHODS: We obtained data for all members of Clalit Health Services who were 50 years of age or older at the start of the study and had received two doses of BNT162b2 at least 5 months earlier. The mortality due to Covid-19 among participants who received the booster during the study period (booster group) was compared with that among participants who did not receive the booster (nonbooster group). A Cox proportional-hazards regression model with time-dependent covariates was used to estimate the association of booster status with death due to Covid-19, with adjustment for sociodemographic factors and coexisting conditions. RESULTS: A total of 843,208 participants met the eligibility criteria, of whom 758,118 (90%) received the booster during the 54-day study period. Death due to Covid-19 occurred in 65 participants in the booster group (0.16 per 100,000 persons per day) and in 137 participants in the nonbooster group (2.98 per 100,000 persons per day). The adjusted hazard ratio for death due to Covid-19 in the booster group, as compared with the nonbooster group, was 0.10 (95% confidence interval, 0.07 to 0.14; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Participants who received a booster at least 5 months after a second dose of BNT162b2 had 90% lower mortality due to Covid-19 than participants who did not receive a booster."	"1533-4406

Vaccine inequality"	"Low- and middle-income countries faced significant challenges in accessing COVID-19 vaccines during the early stages of the pandemic. In this study, we utilized an age-structured modeling approach to examine the implications of various vaccination strategies, vaccine prioritization, and vaccine rollout speeds in Thailand, an upper-middle-income country experiencing vaccine shortages during the early stages of the pandemic. The model directly compares the effectiveness of several vaccination strategies, including the heterologous vaccination where CoronaVac (CV) vaccine was administered as the first dose, followed by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZ) vaccine as the second dose, under varying disease transmission dynamics. We found that the traditional AZ homologous vaccination was more effective than the CV homologous vaccination, regardless of disease transmission dynamics. However, combining CV and AZ vaccines via either parallel homologous or heterologous vaccinations was more effective than relying solely on AZ homologous vaccination. Additionally, prioritizing vaccination for the elderly aged 60 years and above was the most effective way to reduce mortality when community transmission is well-controlled. On the other hand, prioritizing workers aged 20-59 was most effective in lowering COVID-19 cases, irrespective of the transmission dynamics. Lastly, despite the vaccine prioritization strategy, rapid vaccine rollout speeds were crucial in reducing COVID-19 infections and deaths. These findings suggested that in low- and middle-income countries where early access to high-efficacy vaccines might be limited, obtaining any accessible vaccines as early as possible and using them in parallel with other higher-efficacy vaccines might be a better strategy than waiting for and relying solely on higher-efficacy vaccines."

Later, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causal agent of pneumonia. This virus has since spread to more than 180 countries and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Herein, we aimed to determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of symptomatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the relationship between the influenza vaccine with a lower risk of severe COVID-19 infection in the state of Sinaloa. We collected demographic and clinical data of 4,040 patients with acute respiratory infections across Sinaloa state hospitals from February 28 to May 15, 2020. The prevalence of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients with respiratory symptoms in Sinaloa showed 45.2% of men were more affected than women (p < 0.001), and people aged 40-49 years were the most affected. The main symptoms of COVID-19 infection were cough and fever (p < 0.001), while hypertension, obesity, and type 2 diabetes were the chronic diseases associated with COVID-19 than non-COVID-19 (p < 0.003). Healthcare workers were most likely to be infected compared to other occupations (p < 0.001). The general lethality rate was 14.1%, and males >62 years were the ones who had a higher lethality rate (p < 0.001); the aforementioned chronic diseases were related to higher lethality of COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Likewise, higher lethality was seen in housewives and patient retirees/pensioners compared with other occupations (p < 0.001). Finally, we found there was a relationship between influenza vaccination and a lower risk of severe COVID-19 infection and mortality (p < 0.001). These findings showed that healthcare workers, men >62 years with chronic diseases, and retired people were most affected. Furthermore, the influenza vaccine could decrease the severeness of COVID-19 cases."	"2296-2565

To counteract the pandemic scenario, several vaccines against the etiological factor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were developed and tested. At the end of December 2020, BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) was the first and only authorized vaccine in Italy for selected categories, such as healthcare workers, fragile patients and people aged over 80 years old. To master our knowledge about BNT162b2 adverse reactions (ARs), an active surveillance system based on instant messaging was realized for voluntary participants who had been vaccinated at COVID-19 Vaccination Center of the Palermo University Hospital. Overall, 293 vaccinated persons were included in this study, which were more frequently healthcare workers (n = 207, 70.6% with a median age of 36 years, IQR = 29−55) followed by health professional students (n = 31, 10.6% with a median age of 27 years, IQR = 25−29), reporting 82.6% of at least one local or systemic AR. In details, the frequency of at least one local or systemic AR after the second dose of Comirnaty (n = 235, 80.2%) was statistically significant with higher value in comparison to the first one (n = 149, 50.9%; p < 0.001). However, local pain, swelling, joint pain and muscular pain after the second dose were the symptom causing a statistically significant working limitation. The youngest persons showed a higher risk to have either local or systemic ARs (aOR = 7.5, CI 95% = 2.9−18.9), while females had a higher risk of having systemic ARs (aOR = 1.8, CI 95% = 1.1−3.0). Despite the small sample examined, this active surveillance system by instant messaging seems to detect a higher ARs prevalence with respect to data obtained by the passive surveillance. Further studies could be required in order to optimize this clinical monitoring that could be considered an efficient and timely active surveillance."	"2076-393x

Suddenly ending the zero-COVID policy was anticipated to lead to substantial mortality. To investigate the mortality impact of COVID-19, we devised an age-dependent transmission model to derive a final size equation, permitting calculation of the expected cumulative incidence. Using an age-specific contact matrix and published estimates of vaccine effectiveness, final size was computed as a function of the basic reproduction number, R0. We also examined hypothetical scenarios in which third-dose vaccination coverage was increased in advance of the epidemic, and also in which mRNA vaccine was used instead of inactivated vaccines. Without additional vaccination, the final size model indicated that a total of 1.4 million deaths (half of which were among people aged 80 years and older) were anticipated with an assumed R0 of 3.4. A 10% increase in third-dose coverage would prevent 30,948, 24,106, and 16,367 deaths, with an assumed second-dose effectiveness of 0%, 10%, and 20%, respectively. With mRNA vaccine, the mortality impact would have been reduced to 1.1 million deaths. The experience of reopening in China indicates the critical importance of balancing pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Ensuring sufficiently high vaccination coverage is vital in advance of policy changes."	"1551-0018

Imperfections in planning vaccine acquisition and difficulties in implementing distribution among the population, however, have hampered the control of the virus so far. METHODS: We propose a new mathematical model to estimate the impact of vaccination delay against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the number of cases and deaths due to the disease in Brazil. We apply the model to Brazil as a whole and to the State of Sao Paulo, the most affected by COVID-19 in Brazil. We simulated the model for the populations of the State of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole, varying the scenarios related to vaccine efficacy and compliance from the populations. RESULTS: The model projects that, in the absence of vaccination, almost 170 thousand deaths and more than 350 thousand deaths will occur by the end of 2021 for Sao Paulo and Brazil, respectively. If in contrast, Sao Paulo and Brazil had enough vaccine supply and so started a vaccination campaign in January with the maximum vaccination rate, compliance and efficacy, they could have averted more than 112 thousand deaths and 127 thousand deaths, respectively. In addition, for each month of delay the number of deaths increases monotonically in a logarithmic fashion, for both the State of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole. CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows that the current delay in the vaccination schedules that is observed in many countries has serious consequences in terms of mortality by the disease and should serve as an alert to health authorities to speed the process up such that the highest number of people to be immunized is reached in the shortest period of time."

The objectives of our study were: (1) to analyze the load and trend of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, from the beginning to October 2021; (2) to analyze vaccination coverage by age groups and types of vaccines administered and check how the vaccination campaign has influenced the course of the disease and deaths; (3) to evaluate the Italian situation in the European context, comparing the incidence and mortality of Italy with respect to European countries; (4) finally, to evaluate how much vaccination coverage may have had an effect on mortality in the various European countries. Databases were structured to archive Italian and European COVID-19 data provided by Our World in Data, and data came from the Ministry of Health, to evaluate percentage of vaccines administered. The monthly trend of the cumulative incidence per 100,000 inhabitants in the period January 2020-October 2021 was evaluated. It is important to underline 3 peaks of incidence and mortality rates that occurred during the three waves of COVID-19: March-April-May 2020, October-November-December 2020, and March-April-May 2021. There is a slight increase in incidence in August 2021 and in mortality in September 2021. The three mortality rate peaks, related to the three waves of COVID-19, are always higher in Italy than in Europe, particularly in April 2020, December 2020, and March 2021. From May 2021 to October 2021, the mortality trend reversed, and it turned out to be higher in Europe than in Italy. Regarding vaccination, Italy currently has an important coverage, not only in the most fragile population, where it exceeds 90%, but also in the 12-19 age group, with percentages above 65%. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was used widely in all age groups (first and second dose), with highest administration in 12-19 age groups and 80+, while the lowest was recorded in the 70-79 age group. In conclusion, these data confirm the importance of vaccination in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic."	"1660-4601

mRNA vaccine-associated myocarditis"	"SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated myocarditis/myocardial injury should be evaluated in the contexts of COVID-19 infection, other types of viral myocarditis, and other vaccine-associated cardiac disorders. COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocardial injury can be caused by an inflammatory immune cell infiltrate, but other etiologies such as microvascular thrombosis are also possible. The clinical diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Endomyocardial biopsy is confirmatory for myocarditis, but may not show an inflammatory infiltrate because of rapid resolution or a non-inflammatory etiology. Myocarditis associated with SARS-COVID-19 vaccines occurs primarily with mRNA platform vaccines, which are also the most effective. In persons aged >16 or >12 years the myocarditis estimated crude incidences after the first 2 doses of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are approximately 1.9 and 3.5 per 100 000 individuals, respectively. These rates equate to excess incidences above control populations of approximately 1.2 (BNT162b2) and 1.9 (mRNA-1273) per 100 000 persons, which are lower than the myocarditis rate for smallpox but higher than that for influenza vaccines. In the studies that have included mRNA vaccine and SARS-COVID-19 myocarditis measured by the same methodology, the incidence rate was increased by 3.5-fold over control in COVID-19 compared with 1.5-fold for BNT162b2 and 6.2-fold for mRNA-1273. However, mortality and major morbidity are less and recovery is faster with mRNA vaccine-associated myocarditis compared to COVID-19 infection. The reasons for this include vaccine-associated myocarditis having a higher incidence in young adults and adolescents, typically no involvement of other organs in vaccine-associated myocarditis, and based on comparisons to non-COVID viral myocarditis an inherently more benign clinical course."

Our aim was to study the impact of Omicron subvariants on the mortality of transplant recipients. We reviewed the results of SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequence of random isolates collected from 29 December 2021 until 17 May 2022 in King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research center, Jeddah (KFSHRC-J), Saudi Arabia performed as hospital genomic surveillance program for COVID-19 variants. We included 25 transplant patients infected with confirmed Omicron variants.17 (68%) and 8 (32%) patients had Omicron BA.1 and BA.2, respectively. 12 (68%) patients had renal transplants. Only 36% of patients received three doses of COVID-19 vaccines. 23 (92%) patients required hospitalization. 20 (80%) patients survived and 6 (25%) required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Among ICU patients, 66.7% were more than 50 years, 50% had two to three comorbidities and 5 out of 6 (83%) died. The mortality of transplant patients infected with Omicron variants in our cohort was higher than other centers as a limited number of patients received booster vaccines. Optimizing booster vaccination is the most efficient method to improve the mortality of COVID-19 in transplant recipients recognizing the inefficacy of monoclonal antibodies in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants. We did not show a difference in mortality in transplant patients infected with Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 knowing the limitation of our sample size."	"2210-6014

Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Health program in Saudi Arabia aimed to cover 17.4 million adults (70% of the adult population of Saudi Arabia) by the third quarter of 2021. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on the clinical course and outcomes of the admitted confirmed COVID-19 patients, in comparison to non-vaccinated patients. Methodology A retrospective cross-sectional record review was conducted for all hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 patients at Dammam Medical Complex (Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia) from June to July 2021. Two groups were studied according to the vaccination status (i.e., vaccinated and non-vaccinated). Information regarding comorbidities, length of stay, high oxygen requirements, ICU admission, and mortality data were collected and analyzed using the Python programming language (version 3.7.6) with the use of SciPy library (1.4.1) and Statsmodels module (v0.11.1). Results The sample included a total of 260 admitted confirmed COVID-19 cases. The mortality was significantly lower in the vaccinated group versus the non-vaccinated group with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.378 (CI 0.154-0.928). In addition, the OR of ICU admission was 0.476 (CI 0.218-1.042) and OR of endotracheal intubation was 0.561 (CI 0.249-1.265), but these did not reach statistical significance. We also detected a statistically significant relationship between mortality - regardless of vaccination status - and age ≥ 65 years (P=0.000, OR=7.51; 95%CI 3.13 to 18.04), chronic kidney disease (P=0.010, OR=5.62; CI 1.52 to 20.79), and renal transplant (P=0.037, OR=10.17; CI 1.15 to 89.76). Of note, most of our vaccinated patients received only a single dose (85%). Conclusion There is a significant reduction in mortality cases as well as less complicated hospital courses among the vaccinated group, in spite of the fact that most of our admitted patients had only a single vaccine shot. Suboptimal response to the vaccines was observed in the elder, chronic kidney disease, and renal transplant patients, hence the poorer outcomes in comparison to other patients."	"2168-8184

The aim of this study was to describe the demographics of vaccinated COVID-19 cases and compare the mortality rates of COVID-19 cases who were infected post-vaccination in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. We retrieved data for COVID-19 cases who were infected pre- or post-vaccination and had received at least one injection of the Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from 4 December 2020 to 15 October 2021. RESULTS: The number of patients who were infected and had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine was 281,744. Approximately 45% of subjects were infected post-vaccination, and 75% of subjects had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Only 0.342% of the patients who were infected post-vaccination died, and 447 patients were admitted to ICUs. Most of the patients who were infected with COVID-19 post-vaccination and were admitted to ICUs (69.84%) had received only one dose of the vaccine (p < 0.0001). The mean time to infection for patients who had received one and two doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine were 27 and 8 days longer than their counterparts who had received one and two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, respectively. No difference in the odds of mortality between the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines was found (OR = 1.121, 95% CI = [0.907-1.386], p-value = 0.291). Patients who had received two doses of the vaccine had significantly lower odds of mortality compared to those who had received one dose (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccines are vital in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study show no difference between the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines in the rate of mortality. However, the number of vaccine doses was significantly associated with a lower risk of mortality. Future studies should examine the effectiveness of different COVID-19 vaccines using real-world data and more robust designs."	"2076-393x

In this context, many vaccines have emerged to try to deal with this disease. OBJECTIVE: To review the reported cases of neurological manifestations after the application of COVID-19 vaccines, describing clinical, analytical and neuroimaging findings and health outcomes. METHODS: We carried out a review through bibliographic searches in PubMed. RESULTS: We found 86 articles, including 13 809 patients with a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations temporally associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Most occurred in women (63.89%), with a median age of 50 years. The most frequently reported adverse events were Bell's palsy 4936/13 809 (35.7%), headache (4067/13 809), cerebrovascular events 2412/13 809 (17.47%), Guillain-Barré syndrome 868/13 809 (6.28%), central nervous system demyelination 258/13 809 (1.86%) and functional neurological disorder 398/13 809 (2.88%). Most of the published cases occurred in temporal association with the Pfizer vaccine (BNT162b2), followed by the AstraZeneca vaccine (ChAdOX1-S). CONCLUSIONS: It is not possible to establish a causal relationship between these adverse events and COVID-19 vaccines with the currently existing data, nor to calculate the frequency of appearance of these disorders. However, it is necessary for health professionals to be familiar with these events, facilitating their early diagnosis and treatment. Large controlled epidemiological studies are necessary to establish a possible causal relationship between vaccination against COVID-19 and neurological adverse events."	"2173-5808

However, the association between the ABO blood group antigens and the type and severity of COVID-19 vaccine-related adverse reactions has not been elucidated. Patients and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study in Saudi Arabia from February to April 2022. The study cohort included adults who had received or were willing to receive at least two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine of any type. We used Chi-square test to assess the association between the ABO blood groups and vaccine-related adverse reactions. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. Results: Of the 1180 participants, approximately half were aged 18-30 years old, 69.2% were female, and 41.6% reported their blood group as O. The most frequent COVID-19 vaccine-related adverse reactions were fatigue (65%), pain at the injection site (56%), and headache (45.9%). These adverse reactions demonstrated significant correlations with the education level (p = 0.003) and nationality (p = 0.018) of the participants following the first dose, with gender (p < 0.001) following the second dose, and with the general health status (p < 0.001) after all the doses. Remarkably, no correlation was observed between the severity of the vaccine-related adverse reactions and ABO blood groups. Conclusion: Our findings do not support a correlation between the severity of COVID-19 vaccine-related adverse reactions and the ABO blood groups of the vaccinees. The creation of a national database is necessary to account for population differences."	"1663-9812

This study looked at the link between influenza vaccination and the severity of COVID-19 infection. We searched five databases until August 2021. We included studies that reported the relationship between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 outcomes. We pooled the data as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), the data pooled using fixed and random effects models according to the heterogeneity of results. Sixteen observational studies with 191,496 COVID-19 patients were included. In terms of mechanical ventilation, our analysis showed a significant favor for the influenza vaccinated group over the non-vaccinated group (RR = 0.72, 95% CI [0.54, 0.96], P = 0.03). However, the analysis indicated no statistically significant differences between vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups in the term of mortality rate (RR = 1.20, 95% CI [0.71, 2.04], P = 0.50), hospital admissions (RR = 1.04, 95% CI [0.84, 1.29], P = 0.75), intensive care admissions (RR = 0.84, 95% CI [0.44, 1.62], P = 0.60). There were no significant differences between those who had received the influenza vaccine and those who had not in COVID-19 clinical outcomes, except for mechanical ventilation which showed a significantly lower risk in the influenza vaccinated group compared to the non-vaccinated one. However, future research is encouraged as our data have limitations, and the influenza vaccine is regularly updated. Also, this does not exclude the importance of the influenza vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic."	"2045-2322

New variants are continuously appearing with variable degrees of lethality and infectivity. The extensive work since the start of the pandemic has led to the evolution of COVID-19 vaccines with varying mechanisms. We aim to determine real-world data by looking at the different clinical outcomes associated with COVID-19 vaccination, focusing on the rate of hospitalization, severity, and mortality. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective observational study included 624 patients with COVID-19 infection who were hospitalized at King Fahad Hospital of the University and King Fahad Military Medical City between April and July 2021. The cohort was divided into 3 groups: unvaccinated, partially vaccinated (PV), and fully vaccinated (FV). The severity and outcome of COVID-19 disease were compared among the three groups. Among the vaccinated group, we studied the effect of vaccine type on the severity and outcome of COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: We found that 70.4% of patients with COVID-19 disease who required hospitalization were unvaccinated. Un-vaccination was a significant predictor of critical COVID-19 disease (OR 2.31; P <0.001), whereas full vaccination was associated with significantly milder disease severity (OR 0.36; P 0.01). Moreover, un-vaccination status was an independent predictor of longer hospitalization (OR 3.0; P <0.001), a higher requirement for ICU admission (OR 4.7; P <0.001), mechanical ventilation (OR 3.6; P <0.001), and death (OR 4.8; P <0.001), whereas the FV group had a lower risk of ICU admission (OR 0.49; P 0.045). Unvaccinated patients with comorbidities had worse severity and outcome of COVID-19 infection (P<0.05). Both vaccine types (Pfizer and AstraZeneca) had similar protective effects against the worst outcomes of COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccination has been shown to be effective in reducing hospitalization, the severity of COVID-19 infection, and improving outcomes, especially in high-risk group patients. COVID-19 vaccination programs should continue to improve the outcome of such a disease."	"1178-6973

This article reports data on the demographics of pediatric patients with COVID-19 on a global scale using the TriNetX COVID-19 Research Network. In addition, we examined the risk of COVID-19 infection in relation to the body mass index (BMI) category and the protective value of influenza and COVID-19 immunization against COVID-19 infection. The incidence of COVID-19 infection was higher in the younger age group (≤6 years old), but no gender differences. The incidence of COVID-19 infection was higher among African Americans/Black race (28.57%) White race (27.10%), and obese patients; across all age groups, all genders, all races, and ethnicities (p < 0.0001). The incidence of MIS-C was also higher in patients with obesity (OR 1.71, CI 1.36-2.14). We found that the patients who were neither vaccinated for COVID-19 nor influenza within one year before their COVID-19 diagnoses compared to those who received influenza vaccine only, had significantly higher odds for hospitalization (OR 1.19, CI 1.18-1.21), development of MIS-C (OR 1.52, CI 1.32-1.74), and more importantly mortality (OR 1.47, CI 1.26-1.71). In addition, those patients who were neither vaccinated for COVID-19 nor influenza within one year before their COVID-19 diagnoses, compared to those who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, had significantly higher odds for hospitalization (OR 1.11, CI 1.04-1.19). However, those patients who did not receive the influenza vaccine within one year before their COVID-19 diagnoses nor received the COVID-19 vaccine had much higher odds for hospitalization (OR 1.46, CI 1.41-1.51), MIS-C (OR 3.72, CI 2.11-6.56), and mortality compared to those who received both vaccinations (OR 13.55, CI 1.91-9.62). Using the multiplicative interaction scale, we found a positive interaction between the COVID-19 vaccine and the influenza vaccine; they both combined have a larger effect than each separately. Our study is the largest of its kind (to date) examining the global demographic of the pandemic and the first of a kind to find a link between influenza vaccine and COVID-19-related hospitalization, MIS-C, and mortality in the pediatric population."

Risk Factors"	"INTRODUCTION: The Delta variant has led to a surge in COVID-19 cases in Libya, making it crucial to investigate the impact of vaccination on mortality rates among hospitalized patients and the critically ill. This study aimed to explore the risk factors for COVID-19 mortality and the mortality rates among unvaccinated and vaccinated adults during the Delta wave who were admitted to a single COVID-19 care center in Tripoli, Libya. METHODS: The study involved two independent cohorts (n = 341). One cohort was collected retrospectively from May 2021-August 2021 and the second cohort was prospectively collected from August 2021-October 2021. Most of the patients in the study became ill during the Delta wave. The two cohorts were merged and analysed as one group. RESULTS: Most patients were male (60.5%) and 53.3% were >60 years old. The vast majority of patients did not have a previous COVID-19 infection (98.9%) and were unvaccinated (90.3%). Among vaccinated patients, 30 had received one dose of vaccine and only 3 had received two doses. Among patients who received one dose, 58.1% (18/31) died and 41.9% (13/31) survived. Most patients (72.2%) had a pre-existing medical condition. A multivariable prediction model showed that age >60 years was significantly associated with death (odds ratio = 2.328, CI 1.5-3.7, p-value = <0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that previous infection or full vaccination against COVID-19 significantly reduces hospitalization and death. However, a single vaccine dose may not be adequate, especially for older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions. High-risk older patients with comorbidities should be fully vaccinated and offered up to date bivalent COVID-19 booster doses."	"1932-6203

OBJECTIVE: To investigate COVID-19-related outcomes and vaccine uptake among a population-based sample of adults with MG. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based, matched cohort study in Ontario, Canada, used administrative health data from January 15, 2020, and August 31, 2021. Adults with MG were identified using a validated algorithm. Each patient was matched by age, sex, and geographic area of residence to 5 controls from the general population and from a cohort of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). EXPOSURE: Patients with MG and matched controls. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Main outcomes were COVID-19 infection and related hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and 30-day mortality among patients with MG vs controls. Secondary outcomes were uptake of COVID-19 vaccination among patients with MG vs controls. RESULTS: Among 11 365 233 eligible Ontario residents, 4411 patients with MG (mean [SD] age, 67.7 [15.6] years; 2274 women [51.6%]) were matched to 22 055 general population controls (mean [SD] age, 67.7 [15.6] years; 11 370 women [51.6%]) and 22 055 controls with RA (mean [SD] age, 67.7 [15.6] years; 11 370 women [51.6%]). In the matched cohort, 38 861 of 44 110 individuals (88.1%) were urban residents; in the MG cohort, 3901 (88.4%) were urban residents. Between January 15, 2020, and May 17, 2021, 164 patients with MG (3.7%), 669 general population controls (3.0%), and 668 controls with RA (3.0%) contracted COVID-19. Compared with general population controls and controls with RA, patients with MG had higher rates of COVID-19-associated emergency department visits (36.6% [60 of 164] vs 24.4% [163 of 669] vs 29.9% [200 of 668]), hospital admissions (30.5% [50 of 164] vs 15.1% [101 of 669] vs 20.7% [138 of 668]), and 30-day mortality (14.6% [24 of 164] vs 8.5% [57 of 669] vs 9.9% [66 of 668]). By August 2021, 3540 patients with MG (80.3%) vs 17 913 general population controls (81.2%) had received 2 COVID-19 vaccine doses, and 137 (3.1%) vs 628 (2.8%), respectively had received 1 dose. Of 3461 first vaccine doses for patients with MG, fewer than 6 individuals were hospitalized for MG worsening within 30 days of vaccination. Vaccinated patients with MG had a lower risk than unvaccinated patients with MG of contracting COVID-19 (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.30-0.60). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that adults with MG who contracted COVID-19 had a higher risk of hospitalization and death compared with matched controls. Vaccine uptake was high, with negligible risk of severe MG exacerbations after vaccination, as well as evidence of effectiveness. The findings support public health policies prioritizing people with MG for vaccination and new COVID-19 therapeutics."	"2574-3805

Thus, setting up strategies of vaccination became crucial to control the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We use daily COVID-19 reports from Chicago and New York City (NYC) from 01-Mar2020 to 28-Nov-2020 to estimate the parameters of an SEIR-like epidemiological model that accounts for different severity levels. To achieve data adherent predictions, we let the model parameters to be time-dependent. The model is used to forecast different vaccination scenarios, where the campaign starts at different dates, from 01-Oct-2020 to 01-Apr-2021. To generate realistic scenarios, disease control strategies are implemented whenever the number of predicted daily hospitalizations reaches a preset threshold. RESULTS: The model reproduces the empirical data with remarkable accuracy. Delaying the vaccination severely affects the mortality, hospitalization, and recovery projections. In Chicago, the disease spread was under control, reducing the mortality increment as the start of the vaccination was postponed. In NYC, the number of cases was increasing, thus, the estimated model predicted a much larger impact, despite the implementation of contention measures. The earlier the vaccination campaign begins, the larger is its potential impact in reducing the COVID-19 cases, as well as in the hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, the rate at which cases, hospitalizations and deaths increase with the delay in the vaccination beginning strongly depends on the shape of the incidence of infection in each city."

Vaccine safety"	"INTRODUCTION: Since December 2020, three COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized in the United States (U.S.) and were proceeded by large immunization programs. The aim of this study was to characterize the U.S. post-marketing safety (PMS) profiles of these vaccines with an in-depth analysis of mortality data. METHODS: This was a retrospective database analysis study. Details of the U.S. PMS reports (15 December 2020 to 19 March 2021) of the three vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen Ad26.COV2.S) were retrieved from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). A descriptive analysis was conducted to characterize the reported adverse events (AEs). A comparative (Pfizer-BioNTech vs. Moderna) analysis of mortality was conducted. The mean count ratio of death between the two vaccines was estimated using a negative binomial regression model adjusting for the measured confounders. RESULTS: A total of 44,451 AE reports were retrieved (corresponding to 0.05% of the U.S. population who received at least one dose). The most commonly reported AEs were injection site reactions (30.4% of the reports), pain (reported in 26.7% of the reports), and headache (18.6% of the reports). Serious AEs were reported in only 14.6% of the reports with 4,108 hospitalizations. The total number of deaths was 1,919 with a mean count ratio of Moderna (n = 997) vs. Pfizer-BioNTech (n = 899) of 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.33). CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of PMS AEs in the U.S. were non-serious, and the number of serious AEs is very low given the total number of vaccinated U.S. population."	"2213-7475

Variant Of Concern"	"BACKGROUND: The characterization of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 has been a subject of concern and controversy, especially with the surge of infections with highly transmissible variants worldwide. METHODS: This retrospective national study used comorbidities, vaccination status, SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, and demographics data to profile participants who were reinfected with SARS-CoV-2, defined as having two reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within at least 90 days apart. A multivariate logistic regression model assessed the risk factors associated with reinfection . Two control groups were selected: nonreinfected participants reporting a positive test (control group one) and those reporting a negative test (control group two). RESULTS: Between March 2020 and December 2021, 4454 reinfected participants were identified in Saudi Arabia (0.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-0.8). The majority (67.3%) were unvaccinated (95% CI 65.9-68.7) and 0.8% (95% CI 0.6-1.1) had severe or fatal SARS-CoV-2 disease. COVID-19 vaccines were 100% effective against mortality in reinfected individuals who received at least one dose, whereas it conferred 61% (odds ratio [OR] 0.4, 95% CI 0.1-1.0) additional protection against severe disease after the first dose and 100% after the second dose. In the risk factor analysis, reinfection was highly associated with comorbidities, such as HIV (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3-5.2; P = 0.009), obesity (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-3.9; P = 0.003), pregnancy (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.4-7.4; P = 0.005), and working in health care facilities (OR 6.1, 95% CI 3.1-12.9; P <0.0001). The delta variant (B.1.617.2) was the most frequent variant of concern among the reinfected cohort. CONCLUSION: This in-depth study of the reinfection profile identified risk factors and highlighted the associated SARS-CoV-2 variants. Results showed that naturally acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2 through multiple reinfections together with vaccine-induced immunity provided substantial protection against severe SARS-CoV-2 disease and mortality."

vaccine"	"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 infection is associated with high mortality among hemodialysis patients. Standard vaccine response is generally lower among these patients. The adequate antibody titer response and the outcome of COVID-19 vaccine responders versus non-responders are unknown. METHODS: Hemodialysis patients on maintenance hemodialysis who have received two doses of Pfizer BNT162B2 vaccine were studied. Antibody response was tested after 14 days of the second dose. LIAISON SARS-CoV2 S1/S2 IgG test by DiaSorin (Italy) was used to assess antibody response. Patients were followed between 3 and 7 months after vaccination for COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and death related to COVID-19. FINDINGS: A total of 138 patients received two doses of Pfizer BNT162B2 vaccine. One hundred and twenty-seven patients had adequate response to the vaccine with IgG level ≥ 15 AU/ml versus 11 patients had poor response with IgG level ≤ 15 AU/ml. The response was 92% (127/138). Patient with history of prior COVID-19 infection had higher antibody titer mean of 339 ± 113 versus 157 ± 140 for patient with no prior history of COVID-19. Seven patients in both groups had COVID-19 infection post vaccine. Among the responders, five patients had COIVD-19 infection and two were hospitalized. These two patients had lower antibody titer of 23.9 and 75.2 AU/ml. In comparison, three patients who were not hospitalized had higher antibody titer 96.3, 118, and 319 AU/ml, respectively. In the non-responders one patient was hospitalized and one death occurred with rate of infection of 18%. DISCUSSION: Seropositive patients with low antibody titer might be associated with worse outcome among responders. The ideal antibody titer level among dialysis patient is not known. Also, prior COVID-19 infection is associated with higher response to vaccine with higher antibody titer. All non-responders did not have prior COVID-19 infection. More research is required to further evaluated protective antibody titer."	"1542-4758

Many questions have since been raised surrounding the safety of the vaccines, and a lot of media attention to certain side effects. This caused a state of vaccine hesitancy that may prove problematic in the global effort to control the virus. This review was undertaken with the aim of putting together all the reported cardiovascular and haematological events post COVID-19 vaccination in published literature and to suggest possible mechanisms to explain these rare phenomena."

By December 2021, the quartile rankings of three-fifths of the countries differ when ranked by excess vs. official mortality. Countries that are 'doing substantially better' in the excess mortality are characterized by higher urban population shares; higher GDP/Capita; and higher scores on institutional and policy variables. We perform two regressions in which the ratio of Cumulative Excess to Official Covid-19 mortalities (E/O ratio) is regressed on covariates. In a narrow study, controlling for GDP/Capita and vaccination rates, by December 2021 the E/O ratio was smaller in countries with higher vaccination rates. In a broad study, adding institutional and policy variables, the E/O ratio was smaller in countries with higher degree of voice and accountability. The arrival of vaccines in 2021 and voice and accountability had a discernible association on the E/O ratio."	"0264-9993

In response to an urgent request from the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, we aimed to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes (ie, COVID-19-related hospitalisation or death) in individuals who had completed their primary COVID-19 vaccination schedule and had received the first booster vaccine. METHODS: We constructed prospective cohorts across all four UK nations through linkages of primary care, RT-PCR testing, vaccination, hospitalisation, and mortality data on 30 million people. We included individuals who received primary vaccine doses of BNT162b2 (tozinameran; Pfizer-BioNTech) or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccines in our initial analyses. We then restricted analyses to those given a BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 (elasomeran; Moderna) booster and had a severe COVID-19 outcome between Dec 20, 2021, and Feb 28, 2022 (when the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant was dominant). We fitted time-dependent Poisson regression models and calculated adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) and 95% CIs for the associations between risk factors and COVID-19-related hospitalisation or death. We adjusted for a range of potential covariates, including age, sex, comorbidities, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Stratified analyses were conducted by vaccine type. We then did pooled analyses across UK nations using fixed-effect meta-analyses. FINDINGS: Between Dec 8, 2020, and Feb 28, 2022, 16 208 600 individuals completed their primary vaccine schedule and 13 836 390 individuals received a booster dose. Between Dec 20, 2021, and Feb 28, 2022, 59 510 (0·4%) of the primary vaccine group and 26 100 (0·2%) of those who received their booster had severe COVID-19 outcomes. The risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes reduced after receiving the booster (rate change: 8·8 events per 1000 person-years to 7·6 events per 1000 person-years). Older adults (≥80 years vs 18-49 years; aRR 3·60 [95% CI 3·45-3·75]), those with comorbidities (≥5 comorbidities vs none; 9·51 [9·07-9·97]), being male (male vs female; 1·23 [1·20-1·26]), and those with certain underlying health conditions-in particular, individuals receiving immunosuppressants (yes vs no; 5·80 [5·53-6·09])-and those with chronic kidney disease (stage 5 vs no; 3·71 [2·90-4·74]) remained at high risk despite the initial booster. Individuals with a history of COVID-19 infection were at reduced risk (infected ≥9 months before booster dose vs no previous infection; aRR 0·41 [95% CI 0·29-0·58]). INTERPRETATION: Older people, those with multimorbidity, and those with specific underlying health conditions remain at increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation and death after the initial vaccine booster and should, therefore, be prioritised for additional boosters, including novel optimised versions, and the increasing array of COVID-19 therapeutics.

Data were extracted from the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Health Observatory data repository regarding the polio immunization coverage estimates and correlated to the overall morbidity and mortality for COVID-19 among different countries. Data were analyzed using R software version 4.0.2. Mean and standard deviation were used to represent continuous variables while we used frequencies and percentages to represent categorical variables. The Kruskal-Wallis H test was used for continuous variables since they were not normally distributed. Moreover, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rho) was used to determine the relationship between different variables. There was a significantly positive correlation between the vaccine coverage (%) and both of total cases per one million populations (rho = 0.37; p-value < 0.001) and deaths per one million populations (rho = 0.30; p-value < 0.001). Moreover, there was a significant correlation between different income groups and each of vaccine coverage (%) (rho = 0.71; p-value < 0.001), total cases per one million populations (rho = 0.50; p-value < 0.001), and deaths per one million populations (rho = 0.39; p-value < 0.001). All claims regarding the possible protective effect of Polio vaccination do not have any support when analyzing the related data. Polio vaccination efforts should be limited to eradicate the disease from endemic countries; however, there is no evidence to support the immunization with live-attenuated vaccines for the protection against COVID-19."

However, our understanding of the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with CLD is limited. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, observational cohort study of adult patients with CLD who were diagnosed with COVID-19 before May 30, 2020, to determine long-term clinical outcomes. We used a control group of patients with CLD confirmed negative for COVID-19. RESULTS: We followed 666 patients with CLD (median age 58 years, 52.8% male) for a median of 384 (interquartile range: 31-462) days. The long-term mortality was 8.1%; with 3.6% experiencing delayed COVID-19-related mortality. Compared to a propensity-matched control group of patients with CLD without COVID-19 (n=1332), patients with CLD with COVID-19 had worse long-term survival [p<0.001; hazards ratio (HR): 1.69; 95% CI: 1.19-2.41] and higher rate of hospitalization (p<0.001, HR: 2.00, 1.62-2.48) over a 1-year follow-up period. Overall, 29.9% of patients reported symptoms of long-COVID-19. On multivariable analysis, female sex (p=0.05, HR: 2.45, 1.01-2.11), Hispanic ethnicity (p=0.003, HR: 1.94, 1.26-2.99), and severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (p=0.028, HR: 1.74, 1.06-2.86) predicted long-COVID-19. In survivors, liver-related laboratory parameters showed significant improvement after COVID-19 resolution. COVID-19 vaccine status was available for 72% (n=470) of patients with CLD and history of COVID-19, of whom, 70% (n=326) had received the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Our large, longitudinal, multicenter study demonstrates a high burden of long-term mortality and morbidity in patients with CLD and COVID-19. Symptoms consistent with long-COVID-19 were present in 30% of patients with CLD. These results illustrate the prolonged implications of COVID-19 both for recovering patients and for health care systems."	"2471-254x

AIM OF THE STUDY: We evaluated the incidence of PPCs, acute kidney injury, and thromboembolic complications such as pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, and 30-day mortality rate in post-COVID-19 patients undergoing surgery compared to those without a history of COVID-19 infection. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: It was a retrospective, observational, case-control study conducted in a tertiary care center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and sixty-six post-COVID-19 surgical patients were included. A matched control group (n = 166) was formed by choosing patients with no history of COVID-19 who underwent similar surgical procedures under a similar technique of anesthesia. Their medical records were analyzed for the development of postoperative pulmonary and nonpulmonary complications and 30-day mortality. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Independent samples t-test and Chi-squared test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of patients in the control group was significantly higher than those in the post-COVID-19 group. The number of patients who received two doses of vaccine was also significantly higher in the control group. Comparison of the distribution of preexisting medical conditions and postoperative complications, duration of hospital stay, and incidence of 30-day mortality did not show any significant difference in both groups. CONCLUSION: Incidence of postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and 30-day mortality in post-COVID-19 patients undergoing surgical procedures were comparable with patients with no history of COVID-19 infection."

This study evaluated the effect of prior vaccination with either Oxford Astra Zeneca's Covishield™ or Bharath Biotech's Covaxin® on mortality among symptomatic COVID-19 patients during the second wave of the pandemic in India. METHODOLOGY: In this cohort study comprising of RT-PCR confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 patients presenting during April and May 2021, the effect of prior vaccination on mortality (primary outcome), need for hospitalization, oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission were assessed and expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the cohort (n = 4183) was 46.3 (15.5) years; 17.9% (748/4183) had received at least one dose of Covishield™ and 4.8% (201/4183) had received Covaxin®. Mortality was 0.2% (95% CI: 0.2% - 0.7%), 3.5% (1.9-5.2%), 6.2% (0.3-12%) and 12.9% (11.8-14.1%) among fully vaccinated (>2 weeks after two doses), partially vaccinated (>2 weeks after one dose or <2 weeks after two doses), indeterminate (<2 weeks after one dose) and unvaccinated patients respectively. The difference in mortality among unvaccinated vs. fully vaccinated was 12.7% (95% CI: 11.4-13.9%), unvaccinated vs. partially vaccinated was 9.4% (7.4-11.4%) and unvaccinated vs. indeterminate vaccinated was 6.8% (0.8-12.7%). On adjusted analysis, as compared to unvaccinated patients, at least one dose of vaccine reduced the need for hospitalization (RR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.35-0.47), oxygen (0.33; 0.27-0.40), NIV (0.23; 0.17-0.32), ICU admission (0.18; 0.12-0.27) and mortality (0.18; 0.11-0.29). CONCLUSION: Among symptomatic COVID-19 patients, prior vaccination with Covishield ™ or Covaxin® impacted the severity of illness and reduced mortality during a period of widespread delta variant circulation. Full vaccination conferred greater protection than partial vaccination."	"1873-2518

OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether the number of in-hospital deaths and in-hospital mortality rate associated with ACSC changed after the declaration of the COVID-19 national state of emergency in Japan. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used a difference-in-differences design to compare outcomes for ACSC in the period before (January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019) vs the period after (January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020) Japan declared a national state of emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses used discharge summary data from 242 acute care hospitals across Japan. The sample comprised unscheduled hospitalizations of patients with ACSC during the study period (January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020). Data analyses were performed between August 16 and December 7, 2022. EXPOSURE: The declaration of the COVID-19 national state of emergency announced by the Japanese government in April 2020 was considered to be an exogenous shock. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the ACSC-associated number of in-hospital deaths, number of hospitalizations, and in-hospital mortality rate. RESULTS: A total of 28 321 ACSC-related hospitalizations were observed involving 15 318 males (54.1%), with a median (IQR) age of 76 (58-85) years. The number of in-hospital deaths was 2117 (7.5%). The number of hospitalizations decreased overall (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.94), for chronic conditions (IRR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-0.92), and for vaccine-preventable conditions (IRR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44-0.76). However, in-hospital deaths (IRR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.15-2.39) and in-hospital deaths within 24 hours of hospital arrival (IRR, 7.27 × 106; 95% CI, 1.83 × 106 to 2.89 × 107) increased for acute conditions. The in-hospital mortality rate increased for acute conditions (IRR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.16-2.54), and the 24-hour in-hospital mortality rates also increased overall (IRR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.19-2.96), for acute conditions (IRR, 2.15 × 106; 95% CI, 5.25 × 105 to 8.79 × 106), and for vaccine-preventable conditions (IRR, 4.64; 95% CI, 1.28-16.77). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that in Japan, the number of in-hospital deaths increased after the declaration of the COVID-19 national state of emergency in 2020, particularly for acute ACSC and deaths within 24 hours of hospital admission. This finding suggests that access to good-quality primary care and inpatient care for patients with acute ACSC may have been compromised during the pandemic."	"2574-3805

We compared the infection and mortality rates in relation to COVID-19 between countries with and without universal respiratory disease vaccine policies. METHODS: In this ecological study, 186 countries with COVID-19 statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) were included. RESULTS: The study found that countries with universal BCG (bacillus Calmette Guérin) vaccine had significantly lower total infection and mortality rates, 0.2979 and 0.0077 versus 3.7445, and 0.0957/1000 people and confirmed cases (P < 0.001). The countries with universal pneumococcal vaccine (PCV), including PCV1, PCV2, and PCV3 vaccines, had significantly higher total mortality, 0.0111 versus 0.0080, respectively (P = 0.032). Higher income was associated with increasing total infection and mortality rates. Whereas, BCG vaccination was associated with a lower total mortality rate only (P = 0.030). The high-income countries were more likely to not receive universal BCG and receive second dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV2) and third dose of PCV3 vaccination coverage. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection rates increased with increasing years of the second dose of measles-containing vaccine (P = 0.026) and pneumococcal conjugate third dose (PCV3). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that BCG vaccination could reduce the infection caused by COVID-19, and MCV2 vaccine years increases the total infection rate. This study identified high economic characteristics and not having universal BCG coverage as the independent risk factors of mortality by multivariate analysis."	"1938-744x

Statewide variability and inconsistency in implementing risk mitigation strategies are widespread, particularly in regards to enforcing mask mandates and encouraging the public to become fully vaccinated. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted on July 31, 2021, utilizing publicly available data from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. The authors abstracted data on total COVID-19-related cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the state of Wisconsin. The primary objective was comparison of total COVID-19-related cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in vaccinated versus unvaccinated people in the state of Wisconsin over a 31-day period (July 2021). Furthermore, we also performed a narrative review of the literature on COVID-19-related outcomes based on mask use and vaccination status. RESULTS: In the state of Wisconsin during July 2021, total COVID-19 cases was 125.4 per 100,000 fully vaccinated people versus 369.2 per 100,000 not fully vaccinated people (odds ratio [OR] = 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.35; P < .001). Total COVID-19 hospitalizations was 4.9 per 100,000 fully vaccinated people versus 18.2 per 100,000 not fully vaccinated people (OR = 0.27, 98% CI, 0.22-0.32; P < .001). Total COVID-19 deaths was 0.1 per 100,000 fully vaccinated people versus 1.1 per 100,000 not fully vaccinated people (OR = 0.09, 95% CI, 0.03-0.29; P < .001). Narrative review of the literature demonstrated high vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 infection prevention (79%-100% among fully vaccinated people), COVID-19-related hospitalization (87%-98% among fully vaccinated people), and COVID-19-related death (96.7%-98% among fully vaccinated people). Studies have also generally reported that mask use was associated with increased effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 infection ≤70%. CONCLUSIONS: Strict adherence to public mask use and fully vaccinated status are associated with improved COVID-19-related outcomes and can mitigate the spread, morbidity, and mortality of COVID-19. Anesthesiologists and intensivists should adhere to evidence-based guidelines in their approach and management of patients to help mitigate spread."	"1526-7598

We aimed to compare the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa with the risk of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection through visiting routine vaccination service delivery points. METHODS: We considered a high-impact scenario and a low-impact scenario to approximate the child deaths that could be caused by immunisation coverage reductions during COVID-19 outbreaks. In the high-impact scenario, we used previously reported country-specific child mortality impact estimates of childhood immunisation for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, rotavirus, measles, meningitis A, rubella, and yellow fever to approximate the future deaths averted before 5 years of age by routine childhood vaccination during a 6-month COVID-19 risk period without catch-up campaigns. In the low-impact scenario, we approximated the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation on only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks during the COVID-19 risk period. We assumed that contact-reducing interventions flattened the outbreak curve during the COVID-19 risk period, that 60% of the population will have been infected by the end of that period, that children can be infected by either vaccinators or during transport, and that upon child infection the whole household will be infected. Country-specific household age structure estimates and age-dependent infection-fatality rates were applied to calculate the number of deaths attributable to the vaccination clinic visits. We present benefit-risk ratios for routine childhood immunisation, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. FINDINGS: In the high-impact scenario, for every one excess COVID-19 death attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections acquired during routine vaccination clinic visits, 84 (95% UI 14-267) deaths in children could be prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa. The benefit-risk ratio for the vaccinated children is 85 000 (4900-546 000), for their siblings (<20 years) is 75 000 (4400-483 000), for their parents or adult carers (aged 20-60 years) is 769 (148-2700), and for older adults (>60 years) is 96 (14-307). In the low-impact scenario that approximates the health benefits to only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks, the benefit-risk ratio to the households of vaccinated children is 3 (0-10); if the risk to only the vaccinated children is considered, the benefit-risk ratio is 3000 (182-21 000). INTERPRETATION: The deaths prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa outweigh the excess risk of COVID-19 deaths associated with vaccination clinic visits, especially for the vaccinated children. Routine childhood immunisation should be sustained in Africa as much as possible, while considering other factors such as logistical constraints, staff shortages, and reallocation of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We investigated COVID-19 mortality among people with schizophrenia and other SMIs before, during and after the UK vaccine roll-out. STUDY DESIGN: Using the Greater Manchester (GM) Care Record to access routinely collected health data linked with death records, we plotted COVID-19 mortality rates over time in GM residents with schizophrenia/psychosis, bipolar disorder (BD) and/or recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD) from February 2020 to September 2021. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare mortality risk (risk ratios; RRs) between people with SMI (N=190,188) and age-sex matched controls (N=760,752), adjusted for sociodemographic factors, pre-existing comorbidities and vaccination status. STUDY RESULTS: Mortality risks were significantly higher among people with SMI compared with matched controls, particularly among people with schizophrenia/psychosis (RR 3.14, CI 2.66-3.71) and/or BD (RR 3.17, CI 2.15-4.67). In adjusted models, the relative risk of COVID-19 mortality decreased, though remained significantly higher than matched controls for people with schizophrenia (RR 1.53, CI 1.24-1.88) and BD (RR 2.28, CI 1.49-3.49), but not recurrent MDD (RR 0.92, CI 0.78-1.09). People with SMI continued to show higher mortality rate ratios relative to controls throughout 2021, during vaccination roll-out. CONCLUSIONS: People with SMI, notably schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, were at greater risk of COVID-19 mortality compared to matched controls. Despite population vaccination efforts that have prioritised people with SMI, disparities still remain in COVID-19 mortality for people with SMI."	"1745-1701

METHODS: All adults hospitalized in the Capital Region of Copenhagen with a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 and an available variant determination from 1 September 2021 to 11 February 2022. Data from health registries and patient files were used. Omicron and Delta patients were matched (1:1) by age, sex, comorbidities, and vaccination status. We calculated crude and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for severe hypoxemia and mortality at 30 and 60 days. RESULTS: 1,043 patients were included. Patients with Omicron were older, had more comorbidities, were frailer, and more often had three vaccine doses than those with Delta. Fewer patients with Omicron developed severe hypoxemia than those with Delta (aHR, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.78). Omicron patients exhibited decreased aHR for 30-day mortality compared to Delta (aHR, 0.61; 0.39-0.95). Omicron patients who had received three vaccine doses had lower mortality compared to Delta patients who received three doses (aHR, 0.31;0.16-0.59), but not among those who received two or 0-1 doses (aHR, 0.86; 0.41-1.84 and 0.94; 0.49-1.81 respectively). Similar findings were observed for mortality at 60 days. Similar outcomes were obtained in the analyses of 316 individually matched patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among adults hospitalized with COVID-19, those with Omicron had less severe hypoxemia and nearly 40% higher 30- and 60-day survival, as compared with those with Delta, mainly driven by a larger proportion of Omicron patients vaccinated with three doses of an mRNA vaccine."

METHODS: The primary outcome was the number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one COVID-19-related death in 1 year. NNVs were based on postoperative SARS-CoV-2 rates and mortality in an international cohort study (surgical patients), and community SARS-CoV-2 incidence and case fatality data (general population). NNV estimates were stratified by age (18-49, 50-69, 70 or more years) and type of surgery. Best- and worst-case scenarios were used to describe uncertainty. RESULTS: NNVs were more favourable in surgical patients than the general population. The most favourable NNVs were in patients aged 70 years or more needing cancer surgery (351; best case 196, worst case 816) or non-cancer surgery (733; best case 407, worst case 1664). Both exceeded the NNV in the general population (1840; best case 1196, worst case 3066). NNVs for surgical patients remained favourable at a range of SARS-CoV-2 incidence rates in sensitivity analysis modelling. Globally, prioritizing preoperative vaccination of patients needing elective surgery ahead of the general population could prevent an additional 58 687 (best case 115 007, worst case 20 177) COVID-19-related deaths in 1 year. CONCLUSION: As global roll out of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination proceeds, patients needing elective surgery should be prioritized ahead of the general population."	"1365-2168
