AB  - Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common inherited clinical syndrome, characterized by the presence of hemoglobin S. Anemia, susceptibility to infections and episodes of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) are among its features. Since SCD complications (VOC or delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction/DHTR) lead to significant morbidity and mortality, a number of studies have addressed their pathophysiology Although SCD pathophysiology has been mainly attributed to the interaction between sickle cells and neutrophils, platelets or endothelial cells in small vessels leading to hemolysis, the role of complement activation has been increasingly investigated. Importantly, complement inhibition with eculizumab has shown beneficial effects in DHTR. Given the unmet clinical need of novel therapeutics in SCD, our review summarizes current understanding of (a) complement system for the clinician, (b) complement activation in SCD both in asymptomatic state and severe clinical manifestations, (c) probable underlying mechanisms of complement activation in SCD, and (d) new therapeutic perspective of complement inhibition.

AB  - Many pieces of evidence have accumulated over time suggesting sex-and-gender differences in type 2 diabetes, the most relevant being the greater excess risk of cardiovascular diseases in women with diabetes than in men. Drugs available for the treatment of diabetes have, meanwhile, increased in number and effectiveness over the last 20 years. Nonetheless, overall metabolic control of diabetes continues to be suboptimal, with a clear further disadvantage for women. Moreover, old and new glucose-lowering drugs present some sex-and-gender differences, although women continue to be underrepresented in all cardiovascular outcome trials testing their efficacy and protective effects. We conclude that pharmacology should wear gender glasses starting from preclinical research to overcome all these gender gaps.

AB  - Social solidarity is essential to large-scale collective action, but the need for solidarity has received little attention from scholars of Earth Systems, sustainability and public health. Now, the need for solidarity requires recognition. We have entered a new planetary epoch – the Anthropocene – in which human-induced global changes are occurring at an unprecedented scale. There are multiple health crises facing humanity – widening inequity, climate change, biodiversity loss, diminishing resources, persistent poverty, armed conflict, large-scale migration, and others. These global challenges are so far-reaching, and call for such extensive, large-scale action, that solidarity is a sine qua non for tackling these challenges. However, the heightened need for solidarity has received little attention in the context of the Anthropocene and, in particular, how it can be created and nurtured has been overlooked. In this commentary, we explore the concept of solidarity from inter-species, intra-generational and inter-generational perspectives. We also propose strategies to enhance solidarity in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Cardiac biomarkers are widely used in the nonpregnant population when acute cardiovascular (CV) pathology is suspected; however, the behavior of these biomarkers in the context of pregnancy is less well understood. Pregnant individuals often have symptoms that mimic those of cardiac dysfunction, and complications of pregnancy may include CV disease. This paper will summarize our current knowledge on the use of cardiac biomarkers in pregnancy and provide suggestions on how to use these tools in clinical practice based on the available evidence. Natriuretic peptides and troponin should not be measured routinely in uncomplicated pregnancy, where values should remain low as in the nonpregnant population. In the context of pre-existing or suspected CV disease, these biomarkers retain their negative predictive value. Elevations of both natriuretic peptides and troponin may occur without clear clinical significance in the immediate postpartum period. Elevations of these markers should always prompt further investigation into possible CV pathology.

AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis is a disease characterized by progressive scar formation and the ultimate manifestation of numerous lung diseases. It is known as “cancer that is not cancer” and has attracted widespread attention. However, its formation process is very complex, and the mechanism of occurrence has not been fully elucidated. Current research has found that TRPA1 may be a promising target in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. The TRPA1 channel was first successfully isolated in human lung fibroblasts, and it was found to have a relatively concentrated distribution in the lungs and respiratory tract. It is also involved in various acute and chronic inflammatory processes of lung diseases and may even play a core role in the progression and/or prevention of pulmonary fibrosis. Natural ligands targeting TRPA1 could offer a promising alternative treatment for pulmonary diseases. Therefore, this review delves into the current understanding of pulmonary fibrogenesis, analyzes TRPA1 biological properties and regulation of lung disease with a focus on pulmonary fibrosis, summarizes the TRPA1 molecular structure and its biological function, and summarizes TRPA1 natural ligand sources, anti-pulmonary fibrosis activity and potential mechanisms. The aim is to decipher the exact role of TRPA1 channels in the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis and to consider their potential in the development of new therapeutic strategies.

AB  - The artificial lung (AL) technology is one of the membrane-based artificial organs that partly augments lung functions, i.e. blood oxygenation and CO2 removal. It is generally employed as an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) device to treat acute and chronic lung-failure patients, and the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has re-emphasized the importance of this technology. The principal component in AL is the polymeric membrane oxygenator that facilitates the O2/CO2 exchange with the blood. Despite the considerable improvement in anti-thrombogenic biomaterials in other applications (e.g., stents), AL research has not advanced at the same rate. This is partly because AL research requires interdisciplinary knowledge in biomaterials and membrane technology. Some of the promising biomaterials with reasonable hemocompatibility — such as emerging fluoropolymers of extremely low surface energy - must first be fabricated into membranes to exhibit effective gas exchange performance. As AL membranes must also demonstrate high hemocompatibility in tandem, it is essential to test the membranes using in-vitro hemocompatibility experiments before in-vivo test. Hence, it is vital to have a reliable in-vitro experimental protocol that can be reasonably correlated with the in-vivo results. However, current in-vitro AL studies are unsystematic to allow a consistent comparison with in-vivo results. More specifically, current literature on AL biomaterial in-vitro hemocompatibility data are not quantitatively comparable due to the use of unstandardized and unreliable protocols. Such a wide gap has been the main bottleneck in the improvement of AL research, preventing promising biomaterials from reaching clinical trials. This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art and status of AL technology from membrane researcher perspectives. Particularly, most of the reported in-vitro experiments to assess AL membrane hemocompatibility are compiled and critically compared to suggest the most reliable method suitable for AL biomaterial research. Also, a brief review of current approaches to improve AL hemocompatibility is summarized.
Statement of significance
The importance of Artificial Lung (AL) technology has been re-emphasized in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The utmost bottleneck in the current AL technology is the poor hemocompatibility of the polymer membrane used for O2/CO2 gas exchange, limiting its use in the long-term. Unfortunately, most of the in-vitro AL experiments are unsystematic, irreproducible, and unreliable. There are no standardized in-vitro hemocompatibility characterization protocols for quantitative comparison between AL biomaterials. In this review, we tackled this bottleneck by compiling the scattered in-vitro data and suggesting the most suitable experimental protocol to obtain reliable and comparable hemocompatibility results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review paper focusing on the hemocompatibility challenge of AL technology.

AB  - Introduction
Emergency departments frequently care for patients at the end of life and should have robust processes for reviewing delivery of care. The aim of this scoping review is to examine and collate the chart audit tools available to assess the quality of end of life care of patients who die in the emergency department, or, in the subsequent hospital admission.
Methods
A scoping review of the literature using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, and the methodological framework outlined by Arksey and O'Malley was conducted. Primary and secondary research, along with grey literature were searched. Both adult and paediatric populations were included. Databases Ovid Emcare, CINAHL and Medline were searched from 1961 to December 2022; followed by screening and appraisal. Articles were compared and data synthesised into categories.
Results
Fifty-eight articles were included generating three categories; contexts for end of life audit use, development and evaluation of audit tools, and audit characteristics / components. Four tools focused on the emergency department, however, did not comprehensively review both end of life and emergency department specific data. A draft audit tool for the emergency department was developed that consisted of the common elements to evaluate end of life care as identified in this review, emergency department-specific quality of care measures and the integration of the Criteria for Screening and Triaging to Appropriate aLternative care (CriSTAL) tool.
Conclusion
No audit tool to comprehensively review end of life care provided for patients at the end of life in the emergency department was found. We developed an audit tool based on best available evidence that now needs testing for validity, feasibility, and usability to evaluate end of life in the emergency department setting is required.

AB  - Summary
The United States has a highly sophisticated pediatric healthcare system and spends more than any other country per capita on children’s healthcare. However, not all children have access to needed and affordable health care and the life expectancy and health outcomes of children in the country are worse than in any other industrialized nation. These nations typically offer universal healthcare for children as part of a robust recognition of a children’s rights framework. In 1989 the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child that recognizes the right of the child to the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health. Currently the United States is the only United Nations member country that has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This paper outlines the potential benefits of adopting a child rights approach based on the principles and provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The fact that countries who invest much less in healthcare compared to the United States can achieve better health outcomes provides the certainty that a solution is possible and within reach.

AB  - Existing assessment pathways for acute chest pain are often resource-intensive, prolonged, and expensive. In this review, the authors describe existing chest pain pathways and current issues at the patient and system level, and provide an overview of recent advances in chest pain research that could inform improved outcomes for both patients and health systems. There are multiple avenues to improve existing models of chest pain care, including novel risk stratification pathways incorporating highly sensitive point-of-care troponin assays; new devices available before first medical contact that could allow clinicians to access vital signs and electrocardiogram data; artificial intelligence and precision medicine tools that may guide indications for further testing; and strategies to improve hospital benchmarking and performance monitoring to standardize care. Improving the speed and accuracy of chest pain diagnosis and management should be a priority for researchers and is likely to translate to substantive benefits for patients and health systems.

Patients with blood disorders who are immune suppressed are at increased risk for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Sequelae of infection can include severe respiratory disease and/or prolonged duration of viral shedding. Cellular therapies may protect these vulnerable patients by providing antiviral cellular immunity and/or immune modulation. In this recent review of the field, phase 1/2 trials evaluating adoptive cellular therapies with virus-specific T cells or natural killer cells are described along with trials evaluating the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of immune modulating cellular therapies including regulatory T cells and mesenchymal stromal cells. In addition, the immunologic basis for these therapies is discussed.

AB  - Dysfunction of the endothelium, a monolayer of cells in the lumen of all vessels, is found near-universally in the context of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases (CVD). Because of its crucial role in regulating vascular tone, hemostatic functions, inflammation, adhesion, and platelet activity, normalizing endothelial function is an attractive target in therapeutic approaches to CVD with prognostic implications. We will review the mechanisms leading to endothelial dysfunction in response to traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors noise and air pollution with focus on oxidative stress and inflammation. A cardiac and vasoactive medication might attenuate vascular dysfunction based on the pathophysiology leading to the environment-induced endothelial dysfunction. The most promising approach, however, represents reductions of particulate matter with a diameter ≤2.5µm (PM2.5) concentrations via improvements in air quality and marked reductions in transportation noise day and night levels as indicated by the World Health Organization (WHO), thereby markedly reducing the cardiovascular burden induced by noise and air pollution.

AB  - Overnutrition is a poor dietary habit that has been correlated with increased health risks, especially in the developed world. This leads to an imbalance between energy storage and energy breakdown. Many biochemical processes involving hormones are involved in conveying the excess of energy into pathologic states, mainly atherosclerosis, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. Diverse modalities of regular exercise have been shown to be beneficial, to varying extents, in overcoming the overnutrition comorbidities. Cellular exercises and hormesis are triggered by dietary protocols that could underlie the cellular mechanisms involved in modulating the deleterious effects of overnutrition through activation of specific cellular signal pathways. Of interest are the oxidative stress signaling, nuclear factor erythroid-2, insulin-like growth factor-1, AMP-activated protein kinase as well as sirtuins and nuclear factor-κB. Therefore, the value of intermittent fasting diets as well as different diet regimens inducing hormesis are evaluated in terms of their beneficial effects on health and longevity. In parallel, important effects of diets on the immune system are explored as essential components that can undermine the overall health outcome. Additionally, the subtle but relevant relation between diet and sleep is investigated for its impact on the cardiovascular system and quality of life. The aim of this review is to focus on how calorie restriction triggers multiple molecular pathways that ultimately lead to hormetic effects resulting in cell longevity and resistance to cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are currently the first-choice therapy for the prevention of cardioembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation and for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to their more favorable efficacy to safety profile in comparison to vitamin K antagonists (VKA). DOACs did not show a clinical benefit when used for in stroke prevention in patients with mechanic or rheumatic valves or in those who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), in the treatment of VTE in patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and in prevention of VTE in medically ill patients. There are some concerns for bleeding excess at the gastrointestinal site for some, but not all, DOACs. In recent years, in order to overcome the limitations of the available DOACs and to explore the advantages of anticoagulation in additional clinical settings, the development of factor XI and factor XII inhibitors as anticoagulant agents has been proposed. Emerging data show that factor XI has a minor role in the physiological process of hemostasis and an important role in the development of thrombosis. Bleeding has been viewed for several years as an unavoidable side effect of anticoagulant therapy. The aim of factor XI inhibitors is to challenge this dogma by favoring the uncoupling between hemostasis and thrombosis. This paper provides an update on the rationale for the use of factor XI inhibitors, their pharmacological properties and the preliminary clinical findings.

AB  - Obesity contributes to reduced life expectancy because of its link with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Yet, targeting this poorly diagnosed, ill-defined, and underaddressed modifiable risk factor remains a challenge. In this review, we emphasize that the tendency among health care professionals to amalgam all forms of obesity altogether as a single entity may contribute to such difficulties and discrepancies. Obesity is a heterogeneous condition both in terms of causes and health consequences. Attention should be given to 2 prevalent subgroups of individuals: 1) patients who are overweight or moderately obese with excess visceral adipose tissue; and 2) patients with severe obesity, the latter group having distinct additional health issues related to their large body fat mass. The challenge of tackling high-cardiovascular-risk forms of obesity through a combination of personalized clinical approaches and population-based solutions is compounded by the current obesogenic environment and economy.

AB  - Background
The opioid-related overdose epidemic remains a persistent public health problem in the United States and has been accelerated by the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic. Existing, evidence-based treatment options for opioid use disorder (OUD) are broadly underutilized, particularly by people experiencing homelessness (PEH). PEH are also more likely to misuse and overdose on opioids. To better understand current gaps and disparities in OUD treatment experienced by PEH and efforts to address them, we synthesized the literature reporting on the intersection of housing status and OUD treatment.
Methods
We conducted a scoping review of the literature from the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science Core Collection. We included studies describing treatment-related outcomes specific to PEH and articles assessing OUD treatment interventions tailored to this population. Relevant findings were compiled via thematic analysis and narratively synthesized.
Results
60 articles met our inclusion criteria, including 43 descriptive and 17 intervention-focused studies. These studies demonstrated that PEH experience more barriers to OUD treatment than their housed counterparts and access inpatient and detoxification treatment more commonly than pharmacotherapy. However, the reviewed literature indicated that PEH have similar outcomes once engaged in pharmacotherapy. Efficacious interventions for PEH were low-barrier and targeted, with housing interventions also demonstrating benefit.
Conclusions
PEH have diminished access to evidence-based OUD treatment, particularly medications, and require targeted approaches to improve engagement and retention. To mitigate the disproportionate opioid-related morbidity and mortality PEH experience, innovative, flexible, and interdisciplinary OUD treatment models are necessary, with housing support playing an important role.

AB  - Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) has generally been described as a collection of clinical manifestations resulting from an overactivated immune system. Cytokine storms (CSs) are associated with various pathologies, as observed in infectious diseases, certain acquired or inherited immunodeficiencies and autoinflammatory diseases, or following therapeutic interventions. Despite the role of CS in tissue damage and multiorgan failure, a systematic understanding of its underlying molecular mechanisms is lacking. Recent studies demonstrate a positive feedback loop between cytokine release and cell death pathways; certain cytokines, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), can activate inflammatory cell death, leading to further cytokine secretion. Here, we discuss recent progress in innate immunity and inflammatory cell death, providing insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of CSs and therapeutics that might quell ensuing life-threatening effects.

AB  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a common comorbidity in patients with heart failure (HF). Prevalence of the most common subtypes of SDB, central sleep apnea (CSA) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is increasing, which is concerning due to the association of SDB with increased mortality in patients with HF. Despite an increasing burden of CSA in HF, it is difficult to detect using current diagnostic tools and the treatment modalities are limited by variable efficacy and patient adherence. Though positive airway pressure therapies remain the cornerstone of OSA treatment, the management of CSA in the setting of HF continues to evolve. The association of the presence of CSA with worse prognosis in HF patients warrants the need for routine screening for signs and symptoms of CSA in this population. In this review, we examine the connection between CSA and HF, and highlight advancements in timely diagnostics, treatment modalities, and strategies to promote facilitation of compliance in this high-risk cohort.

In its clinical trial component, WHI evaluated 3 randomized interventions (menopausal hormone therapy; diet modification; and calcium/vitamin D supplementation) for the primary prevention of major chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, in older women. In the WHI observational study, numerous clinical, behavioral, and social factors have been evaluated as predictors of incident chronic disease and mortality. Although the original interventions have been completed, the WHI data and biomarker resources continue to be leveraged and expanded through ancillary studies to yield novel insights regarding cardiovascular disease prevention and healthy aging in women.

AB  - Background
There is an increased consumer demand for products derived from natural sources or containing natural compounds used to preserve or improve food quality and/or human health. Carvacrol and thymol, two phenolic, monoterpene isomers, extracted from natural sources such as oregano and thyme, showed antioxidant, antimicrobial, antihypertensive, immunomodulatory and anticancer properties. They have also had applications in functional food formulations, influenced food quality and positively affected human health.
Scope and approach
This review aims to cover the most recent findings related to bioactivities of carvacrol and thymol along with their mode of impact on human health and food systems. It also covers the recent applications of carvacrol and thymol with food products, and as nutraceuticals. Their possible use against SARS-CoV-2 virus and on human health are also reviewed.
Key findings and conclusions
Recently, carvacrol and thymol have been successfully used in products, showing the potential to extend the shelf-life of various foods. Moreover, both compounds showed a positive impact on human health and are considered safe for consumption. Carvacrol has also been reported to have antiviral properties, while in silico analyses suggested they can be used as supportive drugs for combating the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

AB  - Summary
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an inflammatory syndrome that can occur with cancer (malignancy-associated HLH) or with immune-activating therapies for cancer. Patients with lymphoma appear to be at particularly high risk for malignancy-associated HLH. The familial form of HLH is characterised by uncontrolled activation of macrophages and cytotoxic T cells, which can be identified by genetics or specific immune markers. However, the pathophysiology of malignancy-associated HLH is not well understood, and distinguishing pathological immune activation from the laboratory and clinical abnormalities seen in cancer and cancer treatment is challenging. Emerging diagnostic tools, such as serum cytokine or chemokine concentrations, flow cytometry, and other functional measures, are discussed. Mortality remains high with current approaches. Targeted therapy, including blockade of specific cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and IFNγ, and inhibition of the JAK–STAT pathways might improve outcomes for some patients. Finally, we discuss a framework for thinking of malignancy-associated HLH within a larger umbrella concept of cytokine storm syndrome.

AB  - Aging is the primary risk factor for functional decline; thus, understanding and preventing disability among older adults has emerged as an important public health challenge of the 21st century. The science of gerontology – or geroscience - has the practical purpose of “adding life to the years.” The overall goal of geroscience is to increase healthspan, which refers to extending the portion of the lifespan in which the individual experiences enjoyment, satisfaction, and wellness. An important facet of this goal is preserving mobility, defined as the ability to move independently. Despite this clear purpose, this has proven to be a challenging endeavor as mobility and function in later life are influenced by a complex interaction of factors across multiple domains. Moreover, findings over the past decade have highlighted the complexity of walking and how targeting multiple systems, including the brain and sensory organs, as well as the environment in which a person lives, can have a dramatic effect on an older person's mobility and function. For these reasons, behavioral interventions that incorporate complex walking tasks and other activities of daily living appear to be especially helpful for improving mobility function. Other pharmaceutical interventions, such as oxytocin, and complementary and alternative interventions, such as massage therapy, may enhance physical function both through direct effects on biological mechanisms related to mobility, as well as indirectly through modulation of cognitive and socioemotional processes. Thus, the purpose of the present review is to describe evolving interventional approaches to enhance mobility and maintain healthspan in the growing population of older adults in the United States and countries throughout the world. Such interventions are likely to be greatly assisted by technological advances and the widespread adoption of virtual communications during and after the COVID-19 era.

AB  - Summary
Urban areas carry a large burden of acute (infectious) and chronic respiratory diseases due to environmental conditions such as high levels of air pollution and high population densities. Car-dominated cities often lack walkable areas, which reduces opportunities for physical activity that are fundamentally important for healthy lungs. The already restricted amount of green space available—with often poorly selected plants—could produce pollen and subsequently provoke or worsen allergic diseases. Less affluent neighbourhoods often carry a larger respiratory disease burden. A multisectoral approach with more diverse policy measures and urban innovations is needed to reduce air pollution (eg, low emission zones), to increase public space for walking and cycling (eg, low traffic neighbourhoods, superblocks, 15-minute cities, and car-free cities), and to develop green cities (eg, planting of low-allergy trees). Stricter EU air quality guidelines can push these transformations to improve the respiratory health of citizens. Advocacy by medical respiratory societies can also make an important contribution to such changes.

AB  - Summary
Diabetes is a serious chronic disease with high associated burden and disproportionate costs to communities based on socioeconomic, gender, racial, and ethnic status. Addressing the complex challenges of global inequity in diabetes will require intentional efforts to focus on broader social contexts and systems that supersede individual-level interventions. We codify and highlight best practice approaches to achieve equity in diabetes care and outcomes on a global scale. We outline action plans to target diabetes equity on the basis of the recommendations established by The Lancet Commission on Diabetes, organising interventions by their effect on changing the ecosystem, building capacity, or improving the clinical practice environment. We present international examples of how to address diabetes inequity in the real world to show that approaches addressing the individual within a larger social context, in addition to addressing structural inequity, hold the greatest promise for creating sustainable and equitable change that curbs the global diabetes crisis.

AB  - Summary
The UK, and other high-income countries, are experiencing substantial increases in living costs. Several overlapping and intersecting economic crises threaten physical and mental health in the immediate and longer term. Policy responses may buffer against the worst effects (e.g. welfare support) or further undermine health (e.g. austerity). We explore fundamental causes underpinning the cost-of-living crisis, examine potential pathways by which the crisis could impact population health and use a case study to model potential impacts of one aspect of the crisis on a specific health outcome. Our modelling illustrates how policy approaches can substantially protect health and avoid exacerbating health inequalities. Targeting support at vulnerable households is likely to protect health most effectively. The current crisis is likely to be the first of many in era of political and climate uncertainty. More refined integrated economic and health modelling has the potential to inform policy integration, or ‘health in all policies’.

AB  - Preface
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality that is both preventable and treatable. However, a major challenge in recognizing, preventing, and treating COPD is understanding its complexity. While COPD has historically been characterized as a disease defined by airflow limitation, we now understand it as a multi-component disease with many clinical phenotypes, systemic manifestations, and associated co-morbidities. Evidence is rapidly emerging in our understanding of the many factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD and the identification of “early” or “pre-COPD” which should provide exciting opportunities for early treatment and disease modification. In addition to breakthroughs in our understanding of the origins of COPD, we are optimizing treatment strategies and delivery of care that are showing impressive benefits in patient-centered outcomes and healthcare utilization. This special issue of Respiratory Medicine, “COPD: Providing the Right Treatment for the Right Patient at the Right Time” is a summary of the proceedings of a conference held in Stresa, Italy in April 2022 that brought together international experts to discuss emerging evidence in COPD and Pulmonary Rehabilitation in honor of a distinguished friend and colleague, Claudio Ferdinando Donor (1948–2021). Claudio was a true pioneer in the field of pulmonary rehabilitation and the comprehensive care of individuals with COPD. He held numerous leadership roles in in the field, provided editorial stewardship of several respiratory journals, authored numerous papers, statement and guidelines in COPD and pulmonary rehabilitation, and provided mentorship to many in our field. Claudio's most impressive talent was his ability to organize spectacular conferences and symposia that highlighted cutting edge science and clinical medicine. It is in this spirit that this conference was conceived and planned. These proceedings are divided into 4 sections which highlight crucial areas in the field of COPD: (1) New concepts in COPD pathogenesis; (2) Enhancing outcomes in COPD; (3) Non-pharmacologic management of COPD; and (4) Optimizing delivery of care for COPD. These presentations summarize the newest evidence in the field and capture lively discussion on the exciting future of treating this prevalent and impactful disease. We thank each of the authors for their participation and applaud their efforts toward pushing the envelope in our understanding of COPD and optimizing care for these patients. We believe that this edition is a most fitting tribute to a dear colleague and friend and will prove useful to students, clinicians, and researchers as they continually strive to provide the right treatment for the right patient at the right time. It has been our pleasure and a distinct honor to serve as editors and oversee such wonderful scholarly work. Enrico Clini, Jose Jardim, Linda Nici, Jonathan Raskin, Richard ZuWallack (editors).

AB  - Thyrotoxicosis refers to symptoms and signs that arise from excess quantities of circulating thyroid hormones. It can be caused by hyperthyroidism – hyperfunction of the thyroid gland – or by other mechanisms, such as the destruction of thyroid follicles with release of thyroid hormones (thyroiditis) or excessive ingestion of thyroid hormones (thyrotoxicosis factitia). There are several causes of thyrotoxicosis, the most common being Graves' disease, followed by toxic nodular thyroid disease (toxic multinodular goitre or toxic adenoma) and thyroiditis of any aetiology. Establishing the underlying cause of thyrotoxicosis is essential for its management. Diagnosis relies on clinical observation, sensitive hormonal and immunological assays and the occasional use of thyroid scintigraphy. Management of thyrotoxicosis includes the use of anti-thyroid medication, β-adrenoceptor blocking agents, radioiodine, thyroid surgery or a combination of these. Management of thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy and the postpartum period requires special attention and expertise as the correct diagnosis and treatment can significantly influence the outcome of pregnancy and the well-being of the mother and the fetus or newborn.

AB  - IVIg has been used for a long time as a replacement therapy for primary and secondary immunodeficiencies. Beside this supplementary role, when used at higher doses (i.e., 2 g/kg/monthly) it exerts an immunomodulatory role able to control multiple autoimmune and systemic inflammatory diseases. Several mechanisms of action have been described and hypothesized, nonetheless a synergistic action on the different component of the immune response seems to be crucial. The other side of the coin are the costs which showed an increase during the years due to the production of highly purified preparations which limit side reactions. This renders the product not easily accessible especially for low-income countries. Moreover, it is based on plasma donations that experienced a significant shrinkage after the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequences are still impactful. Due to the above-mentioned problems different authors tried to find out if a lower dosage of IVIg (< 2 g/kg/monthly) might exert an immunoregulatory role. In this review we aimed to summarize the current literature about a possible beneficial effect of a lower dosage of IVIg in multiple conditions that would help to treat a vast majority of patients. Even though in some cases (e.g., Kawasaki disease and immune thrombocytopenia) results are promising, for other conditions more research is needed.

AB  - Obesity is a chronic, multifactorial, and morbid disease. In the United States, 69% of adults are overweight or have obesity, and the global prevalence of obesity is increasing. Obesity is influenced by genetic, neurologic, metabolic, enteric, and behavioral processes. It remains a key modifiable risk factor for many comorbid diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. Whereas there are recent and significant advances in obesity therapy, including diets, lifestyle modifications, pharmacotherapies, endoscopic procedures, and bariatric surgeries, there is an immense need for a better understanding of the heterogeneity in the pathophysiologic process of obesity and outcomes. Here we review salient pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the development and morbidity of obesity as well as pathophysiologically based classification systems that inform current obesity management and may inform improved and individualized management in the future.

AB  - This review explores the role of transmembrane neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) in pregnancy, preeclampsia (PE), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Since these conditions are assessed independently, this review attempts to predict their comorbid clinical manifestations. Dysregulation of NRP-1 contributes to the pathogenesis of PE by (a) impairing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling for adequate spiral artery remodeling and placentation, (b) inducing syncytiotrophoblast (ST) cell apoptosis and increasing ST-derived microparticle circulation and (c) by decreasing regulatory T cell activity predisposing maternal immune intolerance. Although NRP-1 is upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 placentae, its exploitation for SARS-CoV-2 internalization and increased infectivity may alter angiogenesis through the competitive inhibition of VEGF. The anti-inflammatory nature of NRP-1 may aid its upregulation in HIV-1 infection; however, the HIV-accessory protein, tat, reduces NRP-1 expression. Upregulated NRP-1 in macrophages and dendritic cells also demonstrated HIV-1 resistance/reduced infectivity. Notably, HIV-1-infected pregnant women receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) to prevent vertical transmission may experience immune reconstitution, impaired decidualization, and elevated markers of endothelial injury. Since endothelial dysfunction and altered immune responses are central to PE, HIV-1 infection, ART usage and SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is plausible that an exacerbation of both features may prevail in the synergy of these events. Additionally, this review identifies microRNAs (miRNAs) mediating NRP-1 expression. MiR-320 and miR-141 are overexpressed in PE, while miR-206 and miR-124-3p showed increased expression in PE and HIV-1 infection. Additionally, miR-214 is overexpressed in PE, HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection, implicating treatment strategies to reduce these miRNAs to upregulate and normalize NRP-1 expression. However, inconsistencies in the data of the role and regulation of miRNAs in PE, HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infections require clarification. This review provides a platform for early diagnosis and potential therapeutic intervention of PE, HIV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 infections independently and as comorbidities.

AB  - Summary
Background & aims
Vitamin supplementations have increasingly been advertised on media and reported to be widely used by the general public to improve cardiovascular health. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people have become more interested in ways to improve and maintain their health. Increased awareness of people on healthy lifestyle is translating into inquisition regarding dietary supplements. Aim: First, focus on the most commonly used vitamin supplements and comprehensively review the evidence for and against recommending them to patients to improve and/or maintain cardiovascular health. Second, illustrate how the interest in studies shifted over time from Vitamin A, E, C, and B to Vitamin D and observational studies led to randomized controlled trials.
Methods
A thorough PubMed search with the phrase: “Vitamin supplements and cardiovascular health” was performed. In the present review, focus was maintained on the evidence for the use of vitamin supplements in the prevention of major cardiovascular events and/or the maintenance of cardiovascular health by comprehensively reviewing all previous studies indexed in PubMed. Studies with clinical ‘hard’ end-points were included only.
Results
A total of 87 studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in the present article. High-quality evidence suggesting benefits for the use of vitamin supplements to maintain or improve cardiovascular health in people is minimal to non-existent.
Conclusions
Vitamin supplementation does not improve clinical cardiovascular outcomes in general population. Counseling on the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle with adequate and nutritious food intake seems more appropriate to improve and maintain cardiovascular health.

AB  - Background
Seasonal trends in patient outcomes are an under-researched area in perioperative care. This systematic review evaluates the published literature on seasonal variation in surgical outcomes worldwide.
Methods
MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CINHAL, and Web of Science were searched for studies on major surgical procedures, examining mortality or other patient-relevant outcomes, across seasonal periods up to February 2019. Major surgery was defined as a procedure requiring an overnight stay in an inpatient medical facility. We included studies exploring variation according to calendar and meteorological seasons and recurring annual events including staff turnover. Quality was assessed using an adapted Downs and Black scoring system.
Results
The literature search identified 82 studies, including 22 210 299 patients from four continents. Because of the heterogeneity of reported outcomes and literature scope, a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Mass staff changeover was investigated in 37 studies; the majority (22) of these did not show strong evidence of worse outcomes. Of the 47 studies that examined outcomes across meteorological or calendar seasons, 33 found evidence of seasonal variation. Outcomes were often worse in winter (16 studies). This trend was particularly prominent amongst surgical procedures classed as an ‘emergency’ (five of nine studies). There was evidence for increased postoperative surgical site infections during summer (seven of 12 studies examining this concept).
Conclusion
This systematic review provides tentative evidence for an increased risk of postoperative surgical site infections in summer, and an increased risk of worse outcomes after emergency surgery in winter and during staff changeover times.

KW  - Leukocytoclastic vasculitis
AB  - Urticarial vasculitis is a rare clinicopathologic entity that is characterized by chronic or recurrent episodes of urticarial lesions. Skin findings of this disease can be difficult to distinguish visually from those of chronic idiopathic urticaria but are unique in that individual lesions persist for ≥24 hours and can leave behind dusky hyperpigmentation. This disease is most often idiopathic but has been linked to certain drugs, infections, autoimmune connective disease, myelodysplastic disorders, and malignancies. More recently, some authors have reported associations between urticarial vasculitis and COVID-19, as well as influenza A/H1N1 infection. Urticarial vasculitis can extend systemically as well, most often affecting the musculoskeletal, renal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and ocular systems. Features of leukocytoclastic vasculitis seen on histopathologic examination are diagnostic of this disease, but not always seen. In practice, antibiotics, dapsone, colchicine, and hydroxychloroquine are popular first-line therapies, especially for mild cutaneous disease. In more severe cases, immunosuppressives, including methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and cyclosporine, as well as corticosteroids, may be necessary for control. More recently, select biologic therapies, including rituximab, omalizumab, and interleukin-1 inhibitors have shown promise for the treatment of recalcitrant or refractory cases.

AB  - Oxygen supplementation has been a mainstay in the management of patients with acute cardiac disease. Although hypoxia is known to be detrimental, the adverse effects of artificially high oxygen levels (hyperoxia) have only recently been recognized. Hyperoxia may induce harmful hemodynamic effects, including peripheral and coronary vasoconstriction, and direct cellular toxicity through the production of reactive oxygen species. In addition, emerging evidence has shown that hyperoxia is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Thus, it is essential for the cardiac intensive care unit clinician to understand the available evidence and titrate oxygen therapies to specific goals. This review summarizes the pathophysiology of oxygen within the cardiovascular system and the association between supplemental oxygen and hyperoxia in patients with common cardiac intensive care unit diagnoses, including acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, shock, cardiac arrest, pulmonary hypertension, and respiratory failure. Finally, we highlight lessons learned from available trials, gaps in knowledge, and future directions.

AB  - Urologic cancers (UC) account for 13.1% of all new cancer cases and 7.9% of all cancer-related deaths. A growing body of evidence has indicated a potential causal link between obesity and UC. The aim of the present review is to appraise in a critical and integrative manner evidence from meta-analyses and mechanistic studies on the role of obesity in four prevalent UC (kidney-KC, prostate-PC, urinary bladder-UBC, and testicular cancer-TC). Special emphasis is given on Mendelian Randomization Studies (MRS) corroborating a genetic causal association between obesity and UC, as well as on the role of classical and novel adipocytokines. Furthermore, the molecular pathways that link obesity to the development and progression of these cancers are reviewed. Available evidence indicates that obesity confers increased risk for KC, UBC, and advanced PC (20–82%, 10–19%, and 6–14%, respectively), whereas for TC adult height (5-cm increase) may increase the risk by 13%. Obese females tend to be more susceptible to UBC and KC than obese males. MRS have shown that a higher genetic-predicted BMI may be causally linked to KC and UBC but not PC and TC. Biological mechanisms that are involved in the association between excess body weight and UC include the Insulin-like Growth Factor axis, altered availability of sex hormones, chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, abnormal secretion of adipocytokines, ectopic fat deposition, dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal and urinary tract microbiomes and circadian rhythm dysregulation. Anti-hyperglycemic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and adipokine receptor agonists/antagonists show potential as adjuvant cancer therapies. Identifying obesity as a modifiable risk factor for UC may have significant public health implications, allowing clinicians to tailor individualized prevention strategies for patients with excess body weight.

AB  - Summary: Kidney disease has disparate effects on racial and ethnic minority groups, who have higher rates of chronic kidney disease and generally poorer outcomes. These disparate rates and outcomes have been attributed to social determinants of health; however, these social determinants of health are related to governmental and societal structural barriers that have created inequities not only in kidney disease, but also in other chronic diseases and in maternal/fetal health outcomes. The societal barriers to health equity include income inequality, inadequate education, environmental injustice, mass incarceration, and the enduring effects of the legacy of slavery. The approach to reducing disparities in kidney outcomes must be viewed through the lens of social justice to address these societal barriers.

AB  - Objective
The study aimed to identify, appraise and update evidence on the association between cold temperatures (i.e. <18°C) within homes (i.e. dwellings) and health and well-being outcomes.
Study design
This study was a systematic review.
Methods
Seven databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, APA PsycInfo, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Coronavirus Research Database) were searched for studies published between 2014 and 2022, which explored the association between cold indoor temperatures and health and well-being outcomes. Studies were limited to those conducted in temperate and colder climates due to the increased risk of morbidity and mortality during winter in those climatic zones. Studies were independently quality assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies.
Results
Of 1209 studies, 20 were included for review. Study outcomes included cardiovascular (blood pressure, electrocardiogram abnormalities, blood platelet count), respiratory (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease symptoms, respiratory viral infection), sleep, physical performance and general health. Seventeen studies found exposure to cold indoor temperatures was associated with negative effects on health outcomes studied. Older individuals and those with chronic health problems were found to be more vulnerable to negative health outcomes.
Conclusion
Evidence suggests that indoor temperatures <18°C are associated with negative health effects. However, the evidence is insufficient to allow clear conclusions regarding outcomes from specific temperature thresholds for different population groups. Significant gaps in the current evidence base are identified, including research on the impacts of cold indoor temperatures on mental health and well-being, studies involving young children, and the long-term health effects of cold indoor temperatures.

AB  - Drug discoveries can, when used appropriately, save lives. Since 1970, cancer death rates among people aged under 65 have halved in countries such as the USA and the UK. Despite pharmaceutical market imperfections and fears about the prices of new treatments, further progress should be possible during the 2020s. Anticancer medicine outlays account for 0.1–0.2% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of developed countries. Total cancer service spending typically stands at ∼0.8% of GDP. The affordability of these sums is a political calculation. Improvements in the efficiency of drug development and global access to effective therapies are desirable. However, from a public interest perspective, these goals should not be pursued in ways that understate the value of better treatment outcomes and threaten the funding available for ongoing innovation.

AB  - Hypothesis
It is hypothesised that a combination of childhood and later life infections and excess food consumption, particularly of Western style food, initiates and contributes to atherosclerotic coronary heart disease. To consider this hypothesis we have conducted a brief review of the role of childhood infections, food, and their combined influence on atherosclerosis.
Evidence
(i) Studies of populations with high prevalence of infections and low “hunter gather” like food consumption, have extremely low prevalence of atherosclerosis, (ii) there are consistent associations between infections in childhood and adult atherosclerotic coronary heart disease, (iii) there is an association between increased body weight, (an indication of excess eating), and atherosclerotic heart disease, and (iv) there is evidence that a combination of increased body weight and infections influences the development of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease. Infections do not appear to act independently to cause atherosclerosis. A combination of both food and infection appears to be required to cause atheroma.
Conclusion
The hypothesis that infections when combined with excess eating initiates atherosclerosis, is plausible.
Action
Action aimed at prevention of atherosclerotic heart disease is possible. There are three safe approaches to prevention (i) encouragement of Mediterranean like diets, (ii) avoidance of overeating and (iii) vigorous control of infections among all age groups. There is a need to monitor patients with a history of serious childhood infections and poor nutrition. In addition, for high risk subjects, cholesterol lowering statins are of proven and safe value.

AB  - Purpose
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is common in patients with acute brain injury admitted to the ICU. We aimed to identify factors associated with ARDS in this population.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to January 14, 2022. Three reviewers independently screened articles and selected English-language studies reporting risk factors for ARDS in brain-injured adult patients. Data were extracted on ARDS incidence, adjusted and unadjusted risk factors, and clinical outcomes. Risk of bias was reported using the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool. Certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE.
Results
We selected 23 studies involving 6,961,284 patients with acute brain injury. The pooled cumulative incidence of ARDS after brain injury was 17.0% (95%CI 10.7–25.8). In adjusted analysis, factors associated with ARDS included sepsis (odds ratio (OR) 4.38, 95%CI 2.37–8.10; high certainty), history of hypertension (OR 3.11, 95%CI 2.31–4.19; high certainty), pneumonia (OR 2.69, 95%CI 2.35–3.10; high certainty), acute kidney injury (OR 1.44, 95%CI 1.30–1.59; moderate certainty), admission hypoxemia (OR 1.67, 95%CI 1.29–2.17; moderate certainty), male sex (OR 1.30, 95%CI 1.06–1.58; moderate certainty), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.27, 95%CI 1.13–1.44; moderate certainty). Development of ARDS was independently associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality (OR 3.12, 95% CI 1.39–7.00).
Conclusions
Multiple risk factors are associated with ARDS in brain-injured patients. These findings could be used to develop prognostic models for ARDS or as prognostic enrichment strategies for patient enrolment in future clinical trials.

AB  - Summary
Approximately 13% of the total UK workforce is employed in the health and care sector. Despite substantial workforce planning efforts, the effectiveness of this planning has been criticised. Education, training, and workforce plans have typically considered each health-care profession in isolation and have not adequately responded to changing health and care needs. The results are persistent vacancies, poor morale, and low retention. Areas of particular concern highlighted in this Health Policy paper include primary care, mental health, nursing, clinical and non-clinical support, and social care. Responses to workforce shortfalls have included a high reliance on foreign and temporary staff, small-scale changes in skill mix, and enhanced recruitment drives. Impending challenges for the UK health and care workforce include growing multimorbidity, an increasing shortfall in the supply of unpaid carers, and the relative decline of the attractiveness of the National Health Service (NHS) as an employer internationally. We argue that to secure a sustainable and fit-for-purpose health and care workforce, integrated workforce approaches need to be developed alongside reforms to education and training that reflect changes in roles and skill mix, as well as the trend towards multidisciplinary working. Enhancing career development opportunities, promoting staff wellbeing, and tackling discrimination in the NHS are all needed to improve recruitment, retention, and morale of staff. An urgent priority is to offer sufficient aftercare and support to staff who have been exposed to high-risk situations and traumatic experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to growing calls to recognise and reward health and care staff, growth in pay must at least keep pace with projected rises in average earnings, which in turn will require linking future NHS funding allocations to rises in pay. Through illustrative projections, we show that, to sustain annual growth in the workforce at approximately 2·4%, increases in NHS expenditure of 4% annually in real terms will be required. Above all, a radical long-term strategic vision is needed to ensure that the future NHS workforce is fit for purpose.

AB  - Adrenal incidentalomas (AI) may be associated with a mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS) in up to one third of cases. There is growing evidence that MACS patients actually present increased risk of cardiovascular disease and higher mortality rate, driven by increased prevalence of known cardiovascular risk factors, as well as accelerated cardiovascular remodelling. Adrenalectomy seems to have cardiometabolic beneficial effects in MACS patients but their management is still a debated topic due to the lack of high-quality studies. Several studies suggested that so called “non-functioning” AI may be actually “functioning” with an associated increased cardiovascular risk. Although the individual cortisol sensitivity and peripheral activation have been recently suggested to play a role in influencing the cardiovascular risk even in apparently eucortisolemic patients, to date the degree of cortisol secretion, as mirrored by the cortisol levels after dexamethasone suppression test remains the best predictor of an increased cardiovascular risk in AI patients. However, whether or not the currently used cut-off set at 50 nmol/L for cortisol levels after dexamethasone suppression could be considered completely reliable in ruling out hypercortisolism remains unclear.

AB  - Both communicable and non-communicable chronic respiratory conditions have accorded for suffering of millions of people of all ages and stated to be leading cause of death, morbidity, economic and social pressures, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide. These illnesses impair patient's health and negatively impacts families and society, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) affect different organs of respiratory system, involving airways, parenchyma, and pulmonary vasculature. As the number of respiratory diseases are exponentially escalating but still the stakeholders are not paying attention towards its serious complications. Currently, the treatment being used primarily focusses only on alleviating symptoms of these illness rather delivering the therapeutic agent at target site for optimal care and/or prevention. Lately, extensive research is being conducted on airways and systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, airway, or parenchymal rehabilitation. From which macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells, as well as structural cells as fibroblasts, epithelial, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells have been found to be active participants that are involved in these chronic respiratory diseases. The pathogenesis of all these chronic respiratory diseases gets caused differently via mediators and proteins, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and oxidants. Presently, the target of prescription therapies is to reduce the inflammation of airways and relieve the airway contraction. In all studies, cytokines have been found to play an imperative role in fostering chronic airway inflammation and remodelling. Owing to the limitations of conventional treatments, the current review aims to summarize the current knowledge about the chronic respiratory disease and discuss further about the various conventional methods that can be used for treating this ailment. Additionally, it also highlights and discusses about the advanced drug delivery system that are being used for targeting the interleukins for the treatment of CRDs.

AB  - Background
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are drugs with a long history of therapeutic use in the prevention of both rheumatologic and infectious diseases. However, the cardiotoxic potential of therapy with these medications, particularly in children, remains a noted concern.
Aim of review
This review aims to identify whether treatment with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine results in clinically meaningful QTc prolongation and increased risk of arrhythmia in comparison to baseline risk in the pediatric population.
Key scientific concepts of review
Out of the combined 65 children from the four included chloroquine studies with normal pre-treatment QTc intervals, 13 (20%) experienced clinically defined QTc prolongation (i.e., >440–500 ms). Of the combined 56 patients who were administered hydroxychloroquine across four studies, 5 (8.9%) patients experienced clinically defined QT or QTc prolongation. Such effects were found to be most prominent in the initial days of treatment. While QTc prolongation was reported in the majority of studies analyzed, the isolated medication effect is difficult to establish in the absence of placebo arms and randomization procedures. Although hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine may prolong the QT interval in children, there is little evidence to suggest that it commonly prolongs it to a clinically relevant or arrhythmogenic degree with short-term treatment.

Haemodynamic stabilization and correction of the underlying cause should be based on the pathophysiological processes that are occurring. Monitoring the patient's response to treatment depends on careful observation in a high-dependency area along with serial lactate measurements. By optimizing the treatment of circulatory shock, its significant morbidity and mortality can be improved. Here, we give an overview of circulatory shock, recognition of shocked patients and principles of treatment, and explore some of the underlying causes of shock and their management.

AB  - Summary
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common clinical syndrome of acute respiratory failure as a result of diffuse lung inflammation and oedema. ARDS can be precipitated by a variety of causes. The pathophysiology of ARDS is complex and involves the activation and dysregulation of multiple overlapping and interacting pathways of injury, inflammation, and coagulation, both in the lung and systemically. Mechanical ventilation can contribute to a cycle of lung injury and inflammation. Resolution of inflammation is a coordinated process that requires downregulation of proinflammatory pathways and upregulation of anti-inflammatory pathways. The heterogeneity of the clinical syndrome, along with its biology, physiology, and radiology, has increasingly been recognised and incorporated into identification of phenotypes. A precision-medicine approach that improves the identification of more homogeneous ARDS phenotypes should lead to an improved understanding of its pathophysiological mechanisms and how they differ from patient to patient.

AB  - Interleukin-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine regulating different tissues and organs in diverse and sometimes discrepant ways. The dual and sometime hermetic nature of IL-6 action has been highlighted in several contexts and can be explained by the concept of hormesis, in which beneficial or toxic effects can be induced by the same molecule depending on the intensity, persistence, and nature of the stimulation. According with hormesis, a low and/or controlled IL-6 release is associated with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and pro-myogenic actions, whereas increased systemic levels of IL-6 can induce pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant and pro-fibrotic responses. However, many aspects regarding the multifaceted action of IL-6 and the complex nature of its signal transduction remains to be fully elucidated. In this review we collect mechanistic insight into the molecular networks contributing to normal or pathologic changes during advancing age and in chronic diseases. We point out the involvement of IL-6 deregulation in aging-related diseases, dissecting the hormetic action of this key mediator in different tissues, with a special focus on skeletal muscle. Since IL-6 can act as an enhancer of detrimental factor associated with both aging and pathologic conditions, such as chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, this cytokine could represent a “Gerokine”, a determinant of the switch from physiologic aging to age-related diseases.

AB  - Hypertension (HYP) is the first cause of death and disability worldwide. In Spain, one in 3 adults was hypertensive in 2010 (62% in those >65 years in 2017). Despite improvement in HYP management over time, only half of treated hypertensive patients are adequately controlled, which translates in 30,000 annual cardiovascular deaths attributable to HYP. Among modifiable determinants of lack of blood pressure (BP) control in Spain are: (a) the white-coat phenomenon (accounting for 20–50% of apparent lack of control) due to not using ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM, use ≈20%) or self-measurement of home BP (HBPM, use ≈60%) for confirming HYP diagnosis; (b) insufficient patientś adherence to BP-lowering lifestyles (e.g., only 40% of hypertensive patients have a sodium intake <2.4g/day, or follow a weight reduction advice), and (c) use of drug monotherapy (≈50% currently), usually insufficient to achieve an optimal control. It is necessary to implement strategies to monitor the evolution of the proportion of subjects with HYP with reasonable national update, to promote population's knowledge of their BP figures and of other cardiovascular risk factors, to improve the degree of HYP control and vascular risk in Spain.
Resumen
La hipertensión arterial (HTA) sigue constituyendo la primera causa de mortalidad y discapacidad en el mundo. En España, el 33% de los adultos eran hipertensos en 2010 (62% en >65 años en 2017). Y, aunque ha habido mejora en su manejo, solo uno de cada 2 hipertensos adultos tratados está adecuadamente controlado; ello se traduce en unas 30.000 muertes cardiovasculares anuales atribuibles a la hipertensión. Entre los determinantes modificables de la falta de control de la presión arterial (PA) en España destacan: (a) el fenómeno de bata blanca (un 20-50% de los casos de aparente falta de control), en parte por la escasa utilización de monitorización ambulatoria de la PA (MAPA -uso, ≈20%) e incluso de automedida de la PA en el hogar (AMPA -uso, ≈60%) para confirmar el diagnóstico de HTA; (b) la insuficiente adherencia del paciente a estilos de vida reductores de la PA (p. ej., solo el 40% de los hipertensos siguen el consejo de ingesta no elevada de sodio, o el de reducir su excesivo peso); y c) el uso insuficiente de terapia farmacológica combinada (≈50% actualmente) para lograr un control óptimo. Es necesario implementar estrategias para monitorizar la evolución de la proporción de sujetos con HTA con una razonable y decorosa actualización en el contexto internacional, fomentar el conocimiento de la población de sus cifras de PA y de otros factores de riesgo cardiovascular, y mejorar el grado de control de la HTA y el riesgo cardiovascular en España.

AB  - Sustainable nutrition, equaling earth health, involves a personalized approach designed in terms of precision and avoidance of still cogent but unjustified dogmas, equaling public health. For instance, current dietary recommendations continue to dwell on the need to limit as much as possible the intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA), notwithstanding the mounting evidence that the effects of food on health cannot be predicted from the content of single nutrients without considering the overall macronutrient composition and the role of the food matrix. The traditional recommendation to restrict SFA ignores that their effects on health depend on the interaction between naturally occurring food components and those introduced by food processing. It is warranted to modify the still widely promoted dietary guidelines based upon such single nutrients as SFA and instead personalize dietary habits on the basis of the whole pattern of the food matrix. Accordingly, the double edge of malnutrition, that involves deficiency as well as excess and materializes in many individuals throughout their life course, might be tackled by implementing sustainability, with the additional effect of overcoming global inequalities. Within this context SFA may regain their position of tasty and cheap sources of energy to be adapted to each individual lifestyle.

AB  - Summary
A need exists to accurately estimate overdose risk and improve understanding of how to deliver treatments and interventions in people with opioid use disorder in a way that reduces such risk. We consider opportunities for predictive analytics and routinely collected administrative data to evaluate how overdose could be reduced among people with opioid use disorder. Specifically, we summarise global trends in opioid use and overdoses; describe the use of big data in research into opioid overdose; consider the potential for predictive modelling, including machine learning, for prevention and monitoring of opioid overdoses; and outline the challenges and risks relating to the use of big data and machine learning in reducing harms that are related to opioid use. Future research for improving the coverage and provision of existing interventions, treatments, and resources for opioid use disorder requires collaboration of multiple agencies. Predictive modelling could transport the concept of stratified medicine to public health through novel methods, such as predictive modelling and emulated trials for evaluating diagnoses and prognoses of opioid use disorder, predicting treatment response, and providing targeted treatment recommendations.

AB  - Climate change is a major risk factor for overall health, including reproductive health, and well-being. Increasing temperatures, due mostly to increased greenhouse gases trapping excess heat in the atmosphere, result in erratic weather patterns, wildfires, displacement of large communities, and stagnant water resulting in vector-borne diseases that, together, have set the stage for new and devastating health threats across the globe. These conditions disproportionately affect disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, including women, pregnant persons, young children, the elderly, and the disabled. This review reports on the evidence for the adverse impacts of air pollution, wildfires, heat stress, floods, toxic chemicals, and vector-borne diseases on male and female fertility, the developing fetus, and obstetric outcomes. Reproductive health care providers are uniquely positioned and have an unprecedented opportunity to educate patients and policy makers about mitigating the impact of climate change to assure reproductive health in this and future generations.

AB  - Cell death is a fundamental physiological process that occurs in all organisms and is crucial to each organism's evolution, ability to maintain a stable internal environment, and the development of multiple organ systems. Disulfidptosis is a new mode of cell death that is triggered when cells with high expression of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) are exposed to glucose starvation to initiate the process of cell death. The disulfidptosis mechanism is a programmed cell death mode that triggers cell death through reduction–oxidation (REDOX) reactions and disulfur bond formation. In disulfidptosis, disulfur bonds play a crucial role and cause the protein in the cell to undergo conformational changes, eventually leading to cell death. This mode of cell death has unique characteristics and regulatory mechanisms in comparison with other modes of cell death. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown that the disulfidptosis mechanism plays a key role in the occurrence and development of a variety of diseases. For example, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and liver diseases are all closely related to cell disulfidptosis mechanisms. Therefore, it is of paramount clinical significance to conduct in-depth research regarding this mechanism. This review summarizes the research progress on the disulfidptosis mechanism, including its discovery history, regulatory mechanism, related proteins, and signaling pathways. Potential applications of the disulfidptosis mechanism in disease therapy and future research directions are also discussed. This mechanism represents another subversive discovery after ferroptosis, and provides both a fresh perspective and an innovative strategy for the treatment of cancer, as well as inspiration for the treatment of other diseases.

AB  - Pit latrines are widely promoted to improve sanitation in low-income settings, but their pollution and health risks receive cursory attention. The present narrative review presents the pit latrine paradox; (1) the pit latrine is considered a sanitation technology of choice to safeguard human health, and (2) conversely, pit latrines are pollution and health risk hotspots. Evidence shows that the pit latrine is a ‘catch-all’ receptacle for household disposal of hazardous waste, including; (1) medical wastes (COVID-19 PPE, pharmaceuticals, placenta, used condoms), (2) pesticides and pesticide containers, (3) menstrual hygiene wastes (e.g., sanitary pads), and (4) electronic wastes (batteries). Pit latrines serve as hotspot reservoirs that receive, harbour, and then transmit the following into the environment; (1) conventional contaminants (nitrates, phosphates, pesticides), (2) emerging contaminants (pharmaceuticals and personal care products, antibiotic resistance), and (3) indicator organisms, and human bacterial and viral pathogens, and disease vectors (rodents, houseflies, bats). As greenhouse gas emission hotspots, pit latrines contribute 3.3 to 9.4 Tg/year of methane, but this could be an under-estimation. Contaminants in pit latrines may migrate into surface water, and groundwater systems serving as drinking water sources and pose human health risks. In turn, this culminates into the pit latrine-groundwater-human continuum or connectivity, mediated via water and contaminant migration. Human health risks of pit latrines, a critique of current evidence, and current and emerging mitigation measures are presented, including isolation distance, hydraulic liners/ barriers, ecological sanitation, and the concept of a circular bioeconomy. Finally, future research directions on the epidemiology and fate of contaminants in pit latrines are presented. The pit latrine paradox is not meant to downplay pit latrines' role or promote open defaecation. Rather, it seeks to stimulate discussion and research to refine the technology to enhance its functionality while mitigating pollution and health risks.

AB  - Influenza in pregnancy is a common condition that is associated with an increased risk of hospital admission. Women with comorbidities are at a greater risk of severe outcomes. There are substantial gaps in our knowledge of the impact of severe influenza on perinatal outcomes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, but preterm birth, fetal death, infant respiratory infection and hospital admission may be increased. Thus, influenza is a major burden on health services. Immunisation is cost-effective, safe and effective in preventing influenza in pregnant women and their infants but policies and uptake vary worldwide. Operational challenges and concern over the safety, efficacy and necessity of immunisation are common, and there is a lack of evidence on how to overcome these barriers. This review identifies learning points that are relevant to the current coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic through describing the epidemiology and impact of seasonal and A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza in pregnancy, alongside the effectiveness and use of immunisation.

AB  - In this narrative review we report the main relationships between trace metals and the hemostatic system since this aspect has seldom attracted the attention of the scientific community. A basic aspect to be considered is the importance of maintaining the fine control of all trace metals’ levels since they have an important impact on the pathophysiology of the hemostatic system. It is worth noting that poor diet habits are responsible for most trace metal deficiencies, while pollution is responsible for dangerous exposure to them with a consequent negative impact on the general population. This appears of paramount importance in planning the implementation of food and nutrient support to ameliorate the hidden hunger and the quality of life of people especially in developing countries and limiting poisons both in the air and food. As it often happens, when damage to certain mechanisms takes a very long time to appear, no attention is paid to the importance of a systematic prevention to avoid late negative outcomes.

AB  - ABSTRACT
In the aging population, the longitudinal decrease in the secretion of steroidal and polypeptides growth hormones is directly associated with accumulation of senescent cells in tissues and organs. The cellular hypo-replicative senescence state is caused by metabolic stress and persistent DNA damage, which lead to the activation of the p16INK4a cell-cycle inhibitor, retinoblastoma and p53 pathways. Aging increases the susceptibility to physical frailty, sarcopenia, diabetes, atherosclerosis, infectious disease and cancer in the older adults. As a consequence of immunosenescence and reduced immunoreactivity of the innate and adaptive systems, seniors have a weak response to vaccination. The high doses of vaccines have been recommended to boost growth and activation of memory T and B cells in non-responsive older individuals, but it is not sufficient for long-term protection. The treatment with recombinant human growth hormone has been shown to regenerate thymus and increase the repertoire of naive T cells CD4+ and CD8+ T cell and B cell subsets in people with age-related diseases, chronic viral infection and immunodeficiencies. This review presents an update on senescence biology and their clinical immunological manifestations in the elderly. We describe possible immune mechanisms by which personalized recombinant growth hormone therapy could act to prolong the effectiveness of the vaccines recommended to older adults.

AB  - The transition to virtual learning during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic marks a paradigm shift in graduate medical education (GME). From June to September 2021, we conducted a dual-center, multispecialty survey of residents, fellows, and faculty members to determine overall perceptions about virtual learning and assess its benefits, drawbacks, and future role in GME. We discovered a mainly positive view of virtual education among trainees (138/207, 0.67, 95% CI 0.59-0.73) and faculty (180/278, 0.65, 0.59-0.70). Large group sessions, such as didactic lectures, grand rounds, and national conferences, were ranked best-suited for the virtual environment, whereas small groups and procedural training were the lowest ranked. Major benefits and drawbacks to virtual learning was identified. A hybrid approach, combining in-person and virtual sessions, was the preferred format among trainees (167/207, 0.81, 0.75-0.86) and faculty (229/278, 0.82, 0.77-0.87). Virtual learning offers a valuable educational experience that should be retained in postpandemic GME curriculums.

AB  - Monocyte Distribution Width (MDW) is a new generation cell blood count parameter providing a measure of monocyte anisocytosis. In the last decades, it has emerged as a reliable biomarker of sepsis in the acute setting, especially emergency department, and intensive care unit. MDW has several advantages over commonly used sepsis biomarkers, including low-cost, ease and speed of measurement. The clinical usefulness of MDW has been established in several studies and some clinical laboratory medicines have already implemented it in their routine. In this article, we describe the analytical and clinical features of MDW to guide its appropriate use in clinical practice by integrating the research evidence with real-world laboratory experience. The proper use of a biomarker is critical for improving patients’ care and outcome as well as ensuring healthcare quality.

AB  - Abstract
More than 100 years ago, Duke transfused whole blood to a patient with thrombocytopenia to raise the platelet count and prevent bleeding. Since then, platelet transfusions have undergone numerous modifications from whole blood–derived platelet-rich plasma to apheresis-derived platelet concentrates. The storage time and temperature have also changed. The mandate to store platelets for a maximum of 5 to 7 days at room temperature has been challenged by recent clinical trial data, ongoing difficulties with transfusion-transmitted infections, and recurring periods of shortages that were further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Alternative platelet storage approaches are as old as the first platelet transfusions. Cold-stored platelets may offer increased storage times (days) and improved hemostatic potential at the expense of reduced circulation time. Frozen (cryopreserved) platelets extend the storage time to years but require storage at −80°C and thawing before transfusion. Lyophilized platelets can be powder-stored for years at room temperature and reconstituted within minutes in sterile water but are probably the least explored alternative platelet product to date. Finally, whole blood offers the hemostatic spectrum of all blood components but has challenges such as ABO incompatibility. We know more than ever before about the in vitro properties of these products, and clinical trial data are accumulating. The purpose of this review is to summarize the findings of recent preclinical and clinical studies on alternative, donor-derived platelet products.

AB  - Burnout refers to a syndrome of depersonalisation, emotional exhaustion and feelings of reduced achievement. Early studies suggested 40% of surgeons are affected by burnout. However, a post-pandemic GMC report demonstrates a significant increase in its incidence. Burnout is associated with direct adverse clinical outcomes, personal suffering and increased work-force attrition. There are several individual and organizational factors that contribute to burnout and, despite it being well recognized, its prevalence in healthcare is continuing to increase. We examine the reasons why surgeons may be particularly vulnerable to this syndrome, both as individuals and from the environment in which they practise. We discuss why burnout is so important in the current climate, review potential protective strategies and outline why this is imperative for the future of surgery.

AB  - Maresin-1 is one of the representative specialized pro-resolving mediators that has shown beneficial effects in inflammatory disease models. Recently, two distinct types of receptor molecules were discovered as the targets of maresin-1, further revealing the pro-resolution mechanism of maresin-1. One is retinoic acid-related orphan receptor α (RORα) and the another one is leucine-rich repeat domain-containing G protein-coupled receptor 6 (LGR6). In this review, we summarized the detailed role of maresin-1 and its two different receptors in respiratory diseases. RORα and LGR6 are potential targets for the treatment of respiratory diseases. Future basic research and clinical trials on MaR1 and its receptors should provide useful information for the treatment of respiratory diseases.

AB  - Background
An “obesity paradox” has been reported in patients with hypertension and heart failure, in which obese patients fare better than patients with normal-weight. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is an “obesity paradox” in patients with takotsubo syndrome (TTS).
Methods
The prevalence of obesity in databases/registries of patients with TTS was compared to the prevalence of obesity in world general populations. Obese patients with TTS were explored regarding the stress triggers precipitating the illness, hospital outcome, and post-discharge readmission. Finally, the literature on the “obesity paradox” was explored to understand how it could be applied to TTS.
Results
A prevalence of obesity of ∼10–11% has been reported in large cohorts of patients with TTS, which represents 1/3 to ¼ of the prevalence reported in worldwide general populations, suggesting that, normal-weight than obese individuals, are more predisposed to develop TTS, with the latter nevertheless also suffering TTS, when triggered by enormous physical stresses. Obese patients with TTS are likely to have milder hospital outcomes, lower mortality, and lower rate of early readmission. A greater sympathetic nervous system (SNS) response in a number of hyperadrenergic states in normal-weight than obese patients, may explain findings in patients with TTS.
Conclusions
An “obesity paradox” has been identified in patients with TTS. Reporting on body mass index and other markers of obesity in patients with TTS, and implementing some recommendations on monitoring noninvasively the SNS in patients with TTS, may solidify that obesity has a preventive/ameliorating effect for TTS development and its clinical course.

AB  - Summary
Viral respiratory infections (VRIs) cause seasonal epidemics and pandemics, with their transmission influenced by climate conditions. Despite the risks posed by novel VRIs, the relationships between climate change and VRIs remain poorly understood. In this review, we synthesized existing literature to explore the connections between changes in meteorological conditions, extreme weather events, long-term climate warming, and seasonal outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics of VRIs from an interdisciplinary perspective. We proposed a comprehensive conceptual framework highlighting the potential biological, socioeconomic, and ecological mechanisms underlying the impact of climate change on VRIs. Our findings suggested that climate change increases the risk of VRI emergence and transmission by affecting the biology of viruses, host susceptibility, human behavior, and environmental conditions of both society and ecosystems. Further interdisciplinary research is needed to address the dual challenge of climate change and pandemics.

AB  - Objective
to summarize the main updated evidence about the health effects of air pollution and to focus on Italian epidemiological experiences on the respiratory effects.
Results
the recent literature indicates that there is strong evidence for causal relationships between PM2.5 air pollution exposure and all-cause mortality as well as mortality from acute lower respiratory infections, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. A growing body of evidence also suggests causal relationships with type II diabetes and impacts on neonatal mortality from low birth weight and short gestation as well as neurologic effects in both children and adults. Italy, a Southern European country, faces a more threatening air pollution challenge because of the effects of both anthropogenic pollutants and natural dust (particulate matter, PM). The 2020 Report of the European Environment Agency highlighted the number of premature deaths in Italy attributable to main pollutants: 52,300 for PM2.5, 10,400 for NO2 and 3,000 for O3 in 2018. In Italy, original time series and analytical epidemiological studies showed increased cardio-respiratory hospital admissions and mortality and increased risk of respiratory diseases in people living in urban areas.
Conclusions
adverse health effects of air pollutants, even at low levels, have been confirmed by recent epidemiological studies. Further studies should focus on the potential link between air pollution exposure and respiratory infections. This topic has become particularly important in the current SARS-COV-2 pandemic. Based on strong scientific evidence, the Italian government, which hosts the Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD)-Italy at the Ministry of Health, the scientific respiratory societies and the patients’ associations, as well as others in the health sector and civil society, must increase their engagement in advocacy for clean air policies, especially in light of the new Air Quality Guidelines of the World Health Organization.

AB  - Sepsis can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, of which the most common is atrial fibrillation (AF). Sepsis is associated with up to a six-fold higher risk of developing AF, where it occurs most commonly in the first 3 days of hospital admission. In many patients, AF detected during sepsis is the first documented episode of AF, either as an unmasking of sub-clinical AF or as a newly developed arrhythmia. In the short term, sepsis that is complicated by AF leads to longer hospital stays and an increased risk of inpatient mortality. Sepsis-driven AF can also increase an individual's risk of inpatient stroke by nearly 3-fold, compared to sepsis patients without AF. In the long-term, it is estimated that up to 50% of patients have recurrent episodes of AF within 1-year of their episode of sepsis. The common perception that once the precipitating illness is treated or sinus rhythm is restored the risk of stroke is removed is incorrect. For clinicians, there is a paucity of evidence on how to reduce an individual's risk of stroke after developing AF during sepsis, including whether to start anticoagulation. This is pertinent when considering that more patients are surviving episodes of sepsis and are left with post-sepsis sequalae such as AF. This review provides a summary on the literature available surrounding sepsis-driven AF, focusing on AF recurrence and ischaemic stroke risk. Using this, pragmatic advice to clinicians on how to better detect and reduce an individual's stroke risk after developing AF during sepsis is discussed.

The Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease expanded ‘ABC's approach is used to highlight key findings in Preventive Cardiology from 2020 and further emphasize the importance of cardiovascular prevention. This simplified approach helps clinicians focus on the most relevant and up to date recommendations for optimizing cardiovascular disease risk through accurate risk assessment and appropriate implementation of lifestyle, behavioral and pharmacologic interventions. While 2020 not only provided practice changing updates by way of clinical guidelines and randomized controlled trials on topics related to antithrombotic and lipid lowering therapy, diabetes management and risk assessment, it also provided promising data on how to improve dietary and exercise adherence and manage genetic risk. By providing clinicians with a systematic approach to cardiovascular prevention and key highlights from the prior year, the goal of significantly reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease worldwide can be achieved.

AB  - Summary
Despite health gains over the past 30 years, children and adolescents are not reaching their health potential in many low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In addition to health systems, social systems, such as schools, communities, families, and digital platforms, can be used to promote health. We did a targeted literature review of how well health and social systems are meeting the needs of children in LMICs using the framework of The Lancet Global Health Commission on high-quality health systems and we reviewed evidence for structural reforms in health and social sectors. We found that quality of services for children is substandard across both health and social systems. Health systems have deficits in care competence (eg, diagnosis and management), system competence (eg, timeliness, continuity, and referral), user experience (eg, respect and usability), service provision for common and serious conditions (eg, cancer, trauma, and mental health), and service offerings for adolescents. Education and social services for child health are limited by low funding and poor coordination with other sectors. Structural reforms are more likely to improve service quality substantially and at scale than are micro-level efforts. Promising approaches include governing for quality (eg, leadership, expert management, and learning systems), redesigning service delivery to maximise outcomes, and empowering families to better care for children and to demand quality care from health and social systems. Additional research is needed on health needs across the life course, health system performance for children and families, and large-scale evaluation of promising health and social programmes.

AB  - Despite the great success of vaccines that protect against RNA virus infections, and the development and clinical use of a limited number of RNA virus-specific drugs, there is still an urgent need for new classes of antiviral drugs against circulating or emerging RNA viruses. To date, it has proved difficult to efficiently suppress RNA virus replication by targeting host cell functions, and there are no approved drugs of this type. This opinion article discusses the recent discovery of a pronounced and sustained antiviral activity of the plant-derived natural compound thapsigargin against enveloped RNA viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and influenza A virus. Based on its mechanisms of action, thapsigargin represents a new prototype of compounds with multimodal host-directed antiviral activity.

AB  - Summary
Peru celebrates 200 years of independence in 2021. Over this period of independent life, and despite the turbulent socio-political scenarios, from internal armed conflict to economic crisis to political instability over the last 40 years, Peru has experienced major changes on its epidemiological and population health profile. Major advancements in maternal and child health as well as in communicable diseases have been achieved in recent decades, and today Peru faces an increasing burden of non-communicable diseases including mental health conditions. In terms of the configuration of the public health system, Peru has also strived to secure country-wide optimal health care, struggling in particular to improve primary health care and intercultural services. The science and technology infrastructure has also evolved, although the need for substantial investments remains if advancing science is to be a national priority. Climate change will also bring significant challenges to population health given Peru's geographical and microclimates diversity. Looking back over the 200-years of independence, we present a summary of key advances in selected health-related fields, thus serving as the basis for reflections on pending agendas and future challenges, in order to look forward to ensuring the future health and wellbeing of the Peruvian population.
Resumen (translated abstract)
El Perú cumple 200 años de independencia en 2021. Durante estos dos siglos de vida independiente, junto con periodos sociales y políticos turbulentos, incluyendo un conflicto armado interno, hiperinflación y la inestabilidad política de los últimos 40 años, el Perú ha experimentado importantes cambios en su perfil epidemiológico con repercusiones directas en la salud de la población. En las últimas décadas, los indicadores de salud materno-infantil y de las enfermedades transmisibles muestran mejoría importante, pero el país se enfrenta de manera simultánea a una carga cada vez mayor de enfermedades no transmisibles y de salud mental. En cuanto a los sistemas de salud pública, se han realizado esfuerzos por aumentar la cobertura y calidad de la atención de salud en todo el país, apostándose en particular por mejorar la atención primaria. La ciencia y tecnología relacionadas con la salud también han mejorado, aunque si se quiere que la ciencia sea una prioridad nacional, son necesarias inversiones sustanciales. El cambio climático traerá importantes desafíos para la salud de la población, dada la diversidad geográfica y de microclimas del país. Para conmemorar los 200 años de vida independiente del Perú, presentamos un resumen de avances clave en diversas áreas y temas relacionados con la salud. Este repaso sirve como base para reflexionar sobre agendas y desafíos pendientes y futuros, con el fin de asegurar la salud y el bienestar de la población peruana en las próximas décadas.

AB  - Postpartum pyrexia complicates 5% of pregnancies, with an infective cause identified in 50% of cases. Sepsis occurs when an infective cause results in multi-organ dysfunction and this accounts for a significant proportion of maternal deaths. The most common site of sepsis is the genital tract. It is also important to consider non-infective causes amongst the differential diagnosis. In the following article infective and non-infective causes are discussed together with relevant investigations and management.

AB  - Zinc can play a pathophysiological role in several diseases and can interfere in key processes of microbial growth. This evidence justifies the efforts in applying Zinc ionophores to restore Zinc homeostasis and treat bacterial/viral infections such as coronavirus diseases. Zinc ionophores increase the intracellular concentration of Zinc ions causing significant biological effects. This review provides, for the first time, an overview of the applications of the main Zinc ionophores in Zinc deficiency, infectious diseases, and in cancer, discussing the pharmacological and coordination properties of the Zinc ionophores.

AB  - Patients with cancer are at greater risk of developing depression in comparison to the general population and this is associated with serious adverse effects, such as poorer quality of life, worse prognosis and higher mortality. Although the relationship between depression and cancer is now well established, a common underlying pathophysiological mechanism between the two conditions is yet to be elucidated. Existing theories of depression, based on monoamine neurotransmitter system dysfunction, are insufficient as explanations of the disorder. Recent advances have implicated neuroinflammatory mechanisms in the etiology of depression and it has been demonstrated that inflammation at a peripheral level may be mirrored centrally in astrocytes and microglia serving to promote chronic levels of inflammation in the brain. Three major routes to depression in cancer in which proinflammatory mediators are implicated, seem likely. Activation of the kynurenine pathway involving cytokines, increases tryptophan catabolism, resulting in diminished levels of serotonin which is widely acknowledged as being the hallmark of depression. It also results in neurotoxic effects on brain regions thought to be involved in the evolution of major depression. Proinflammatory mediators also play a crucial role in impairing regulatory glucocorticoid mediated feedback of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which is activated by stress and considered to be involved in both depression and cancer. The third route is via the glutamatergic pathway, whereby glutamate excitotoxicity may lead to depression associated with cancer. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these dysregulated and other newly emerging pathways may provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting, serving to improve the care of cancer patients.

AB  - Black women are disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease with an excess burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition, the racialized structure of the United States shapes cardiovascular disease research and health care delivery for Black women. Given the indisputable evidence of the disparities in health care delivery, research, and cardiovascular outcomes, there is an urgent need to develop and implement effective and sustainable solutions to advance cardiovascular health equity for Black women while considering their ethnic diversity, regions of origin, and acculturation. Innovative and culturally tailored strategies that consider the differential impact of social determinants of health and the unique challenges that shape their health-seeking behaviors should be implemented. A patient-centered framework that involves collaboration among clinicians, health care systems, professional societies, and government agencies is required to improve cardiovascular outcomes for Black women. The time is “now” to achieve health equity for all Black women.

AB  - The incidence of cancer continues to rise, with an estimated 1 in 2 of the UK population born after 1960 diagnosed with malignancy at some point during their lifetime. This is in the context of an ageing population with increasing multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Cancer patients are frequent users of emergency care services and have a high rate of ambulance conveyance and hospital admission after review in emergency departments. Presentations can be a consequence of the cancer, its treatment or coexistent morbidity. Given the expanding armamentarium of cancer therapies, acute and general physicians are faced with a myriad of complex issues and require a knowledge of the broad principles of initial assessment, initial management and timely access to the wider multi-professional cancer team.

AB  - After thirty years of intensive research shaping and optimizing the technology, the approval of the first mRNA-based formulation by the EMA and FDA in order to stop the COVID-19 pandemic was a breakthrough in mRNA research. The astonishing success of these vaccines have brought the mRNA platform into the spotlight of the scientific community. The remarkable persistence of the groundwork is mainly attributed to the exceptional benefits of mRNA application, including the biological origin, immediate but transitory mechanism of action, non-integrative properties, safe and relatively simple manufacturing as well as the flexibility to produce any desired protein. Based on these advantages, a practical implementation of in vitro transcribed mRNA has been considered in most areas of medicine. In this review, we discuss the key preconditions for the rise of the mRNA in the medical field, including the unique structural and functional features of the mRNA molecule and its vehicles, which are crucial aspects for a production of potent mRNA-based therapeutics. Further, we focus on the utility of mRNA tools particularly in the scope of regenerative medicine, i.e. cell reprogramming approaches or manipulation strategies for targeted tissue restoration. Finally, we highlight the strong clinical potential but also the remaining hurdles to overcome for the mRNA-based regenerative therapy, which is only a few steps away from becoming a reality.

AB  - Summary
Heatstroke is increasingly becoming a significant concern due to global warming. Systemic inflammation and coagulopathy are the two major factors that provoke life-threatening organ dysfunction in heatstroke. Dysregulated thermo-control induces cellular injury, damage-associated molecular patterns release, hyperinflammation, and hypercoagulation with suppressed fibrinolysis to produce heatstroke-induced coagulopathy (HSIC). HSIC can progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiorgan failure if severe enough. Platelet count, D-dimer, soluble thrombomodulin, and inflammation biomarkers such as interleukin-6 and histone H3 are promising markers for HSIC. In exertional heatstroke, the measurement of myoglobin is helpful to anticipate renal dysfunction. However, the optimal cutoff for each biomarker has not been determined. Except for initial cooling and hydration, effective therapy continues to be explored, and the use of antiinflammatory and anticoagulant therapies is under investigation. Despite the rapidly increasing risk, our knowledge is limited, and further study is warranted. In this review, we examine current information and what future efforts are needed to better understand and manage HSIC.
