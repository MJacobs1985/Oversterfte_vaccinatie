AB  - Obesity-related metabolic dysfunction, endothelium imbalance, chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and its comorbidities may all have a role in systemic inflammation, leading to the pulmonary fibrosis and cytokine storm, which leads to failure of lung function, which is a hallmark of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Obesity may also disrupt the function of mucociliary escalators and cooperation of epithelial cell’s motile cilia in the airway, limiting the clearance of the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). Adipose tissues in obese patients have a greater number of proteases and receptors for SARS-CoV-2 admittance, proposing that they could serve as an accelerator and reservoir for this virus, boosting immunological response and systemic inflammation. Lastly, anti-inflammatory cytokines such as anti-IL-6 and the infusion of mesenchymal stem cells could be used as a modulation therapy of immunity to help COVID-19 patients. Obesity, on the other hand, is linked to the progress of COVID-19 through a variety of molecular pathways, and obese people are part of the SARS-CoV-2 susceptible individuals, necessitating more protective measures.

AB  - Summary
High levels of cholesterol are generally considered to be associated with atherosclerosis. In the past two decades, however, a number of studies have shown that excess cholesterol accumulation in various tissues and organs plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases. Here, we summarize the effects of excess cholesterol on disease pathogenesis, including liver diseases, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, Alzheimer’s disease, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, pituitary-thyroid axis dysfunction, immune disorders, and COVID-19, while proposing that excess cholesterol-induced toxicity is ubiquitous. We believe this concept will help broaden the appreciation of the toxic effect of excess cholesterol, and thus potentially expand the therapeutic use of cholesterol-lowering medications.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic developed the severest public health event in recent history. The first stage for defence has already been documented. This paper moves forward to contribute to the second stage for offensive by assessing the energy and environmental impacts related to vaccination. The vaccination campaign is a multidisciplinary topic incorporating policies, population behaviour, planning, manufacturing, materials supporting, cold-chain logistics and waste treatment. The vaccination for pandemic control in the current phase is prioritised over other decisions, including energy and environmental issues. This study documents that vaccination should be implemented in maximum sustainable ways. The energy and related emissions of a single vaccination are not massive; however, the vast numbers related to the worldwide production, logistics, disinfection, implementation and waste treatment are reaching significant figures. The preliminary assessment indicates that the energy is at the scale of ~1.08 × 1010 kWh and related emissions of ~5.13 × 1012 gCO2eq when embedding for the envisaged 1.56 × 1010 vaccine doses. The cold supply chain is estimated to constitute 69.8% of energy consumption of the vaccination life cycle, with an interval of 26–99% depending on haul distance. A sustainable supply chain model that responds to an emergency arrangement, considering equality as well, should be emphasised to mitigate vaccination's environmental footprint. This effort plays a critical role in preparing for future pandemics, both environmentally and socially. Research in exploring sustainable single-use or reusable materials is also suggested to be a part of the plans. Diversified options could offer higher flexibility in mitigating environmental footprint even during the emergency and minimise the potential impact of material disruption or dependency.

AB  - The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges to global health. Although the majority of COVID-19 patients exhibit mild-to-no symptoms, many patients develop severe disease and need immediate hospitalization, with most severe infections associated with a dysregulated immune response attributed to a cytokine storm. Epidemiological studies suggest that overall COVID-19 severity and morbidity correlate with underlying comorbidities, including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and immunosuppressive conditions. Patients with such comorbidities exhibit elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress caused by an increased accumulation of angiotensin II and by activation of the NADPH oxidase pathway. Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that oxidative stress coupled with the cytokine storm contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis and immunopathogenesis by causing endotheliitis and endothelial cell dysfunction and by activating the blood clotting cascade that results in blood coagulation and microvascular thrombosis. In this review, we survey the mechanisms of how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces oxidative stress and the consequences of this stress on patient health. We further shed light on aspects of the host immunity that are crucial to prevent the disease during the early phase of infection. A better understanding of the disease pathophysiology as well as preventive measures aimed at lowering ROS levels may pave the way to mitigate SARS-CoV-2-induced complications and decrease mortality.

AB  - Pirfenidone (PFD) is a non-peptide synthetic chemical that inhibits the production of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), and collagen 1 (COL1A1), all of which have been linked to the prevention or removal of excessive scar tissue deposition in many organs. PFD has been demonstrated to decrease apoptosis, downregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) receptor expression, reduce inflammation through many routes, and alleviate oxidative stress in pneumocytes and other cells while protecting them from COVID-19 invasion and cytokine storm. Based on the mechanism of action of PFD and the known pathophysiology of COVID-19, it was recommended to treat COVID-19 patients. The use of PFD as a treatment for a range of disorders is currently being studied, with an emphasis on outcomes related to reduced inflammation and fibrogenesis. As a result, rather than exploring the molecule's chemical characteristics, this review focuses on innovative PFD efficacy data. Briefly, herein we tried to investigate, discuss, and illustrate the possible mechanisms of actions for PFD to be targeted as a promising anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-tumor, and/or anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidate.

AB  - On December 31, 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) the outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus that causes a serious disease in the city of Wuhan, China. This outbreak was classified as SARS-CoV2 and is the cause of the COVID-19 disease. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declares it a Pandemic and today it is considered the greatest challenge in global health that humanity has faced since World War II and it is estimated that between 40 and 60% of the population worldwide will catch the virus. This has caused enormous challenges in countries around the world in social, economic, environmental and obviously health issues. These challenges are mainly due to the effects of the established quarantines in almost all capitals and major cities around the world, from Asia, Europe to America. However, these lockdown which began worldwide from January 23, have had a significant impact on the environment and on the air quality of cities as recently reported by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (European Space Agency), with reductions according to them of up to 30% in some of the epicenters such as the case of Wuhan. Knowing that air pollution causes approximately 29% of lung cancer deaths, 43% of COPD deaths, and 25% of ischemic heart disease deaths, it is important to know the effects of quarantines in cities regarding air quality to take measures that favor populations and urban ecosystems when the emergency ends. Therefore, this paper describes the behavior of PM2.5 emissions particulate matter from the 50 most polluted capital cities in the world according to the WHO, measured before-after the start of the quarantine. Likewise, the impact at the local and global level of this emissions behavior, which averaged 12% of PM2.5 decrease in these cities.

Various drugs are under investigation for its treatment. The disease is known to have worse outcomes in patients who have underlying cardiovascular disease. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir are currently being studied in trials and show some promise. Conduction disorders, heart failure, and mortality have been reported with the use of these drugs. It is important to have knowledge of potential cardiotoxic effects of these drugs before using them for COVID-19 patients for better allocation of healthcare resources and improvement in clinical outcomes.

AB  - During a cytokine storm, dysregulated proinflammatory cytokines are produced in excess. Cytokine storms occur in multiple infectious diseases, including Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Thus, eliminating cytokine storms to enhance patient outcomes is crucial. Given the numerous cytokines involved, individual therapies might have little effect. Traditional cytokines might be less effective than medicines that target malfunctioning macrophages. Nanomedicine-based therapeutics reduce cytokine production in animal models of proinflammatory illnesses. The unique physicochemical features and controlled nano–bio interactions of nanotechnology show promise in healthcare and could be used to treat several stages of this virus-induced sickness, including cytokine storm mortality. Macrophage-oriented nanomedicines can minimize cytokine storms and associated harmful effects, enhancing patient outcomes. Here, we also discuss engineering possibilities for enhancing macrophage efficacy with nanodrug carriers.

AB  - SARS-Cov2 is currently causing a persistent Covid-19 pandemic, which poses a risk of causing long-term cardiovascular sequels in the population. The viral mechanism of cell infection through the angiotensin 2 converter enzyme receptor and the limited antiviral innate immune response are the suspected causes for a more frequent cardiovascular damage in SARS-Cov2 infection. Knowledge of: the appearance during acute infection of other cardiac conditions beyond the classical myocarditis and pericarditis), the long-term cardiac manifestations (persistent Covid-19), and the increased incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination; it is of special interest in order to offer our patients best practices based on current scientific evidence.
Resumen
El SARS-Cov2 está causando actualmente una pandemia sostenida de Covid-19, con el riesgo de causar secuelas cardíacas a largo plazo en la población. El temor que el SARS-Cov2 cause un daño miocárdico mayor que otros virus convencionales se basa en su mecanismo de infección de células humanas a través del receptor de la enzima convertidora de la angiotensina 2 y las defensas antivirales innatas hasta ahora reducidas contra un nuevo virus. El conocimiento de: la aparición durante la infección aguda de otras afectaciones cardiacas además de las clásicas miocarditis y pericarditis, las manifestaciones cardiacas observadas a largo plazo (Covid-19 persistente) y, la incidencia incrementada de miocarditis y pericarditis tras la vacunación; resulta de especial interés a fin de ofrecer a nuestros pacientes la mejor atención posible basada en la evidencia científica actual.

Critical care was established partially in response to a polio epidemic in the 1950s. In the intervening 70 yr, several epidemics and pandemics have placed critical care and allied services under extreme pressure. Pandemics cause wholesale changes to accepted standards of practice, require reallocation and retargeting of resources and goals of care. In addition to clinical acumen, mounting an effective critical care response to a pandemic requires local, national, and international coordination in a diverse array of fields from research collaboration and governance to organisation of critical care networks and applied biomedical ethics in the eventuality of triage situations. This review provides an introduction to an array of topics that pertain to different states of pandemic acuity: interpandemic preparedness, alert, surge activity, recovery and relapse through the literature and experience of recent pandemics including COVID-19, H1N1, Ebola, and SARS.

AB  - Purpose of the study
Currently no treatment has been proven to be efficacious for patients with early symptoms of COVID-19. Although most patients present mild or moderate symptoms, up to 5-10% may have a poor disease progression, so there is an urgent need for effective drugs, which can be administered even before the onset of severe symptoms, i.e. when the course of the disease is modifiable. Recently, promising results of several studies on oral ivermectin have been published, which has prompted us to conduct the present review of the scientific literature.
Methods
A narrative review has been carried out, focusing on the following four main topics: a) short-term efficacy in the treatment of the disease, b) long-term efficacy in the treatment of patients with post-acute symptoms of COVID-19, c) efficacy in the prophylaxis of the disease, and c) safety of ivermectin.
Results
The reviewed literature suggests that there seems to be sufficient evidence about the safety of oral ivermectin, as well as the efficacy of the drug in the early-treatment and the prophylaxis of COVID-19.
Conclusions
In the view of the available evidence, the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC) recommends the use of oral ivermectin for both prophylaxis and early-treatment of COVID-19. Further well-designed studies should be conducted in order to explore the efficacy and safety of invermectin at low and high doses, following different dosing schedules, in both, the short and long-term treatment.

To systematically review contemporary prediction models for hospital mortality developed or validated in general medical patients.
Methods
We screened articles in five databases, from January 1, 2010, through April 7, 2022, and the bibliography of articles selected for final inclusion. We assessed the quality for risk of bias and applicability using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) and extracted data using the Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS) checklist. Two investigators independently screened each article, assessed quality, and extracted data.
Results
From 20,424 unique articles, we identified 15 models in 8 studies across 10 countries. The studies included 280,793 general medical patients and 19,923 hospital deaths. Models included 7 early warning scores, 2 comorbidities indices, and 6 combination models. Ten models were studied in all general medical patients (general models) and 7 in general medical patients with infection (infection models). Of the 15 models, 13 were developed using logistic or Poisson regression and 2 using machine learning methods. Also, 4 of 15 models reported on handling of missing values. None of the infection models had high discrimination, whereas 4 of 10 general models had high discrimination (area under curve >0.8). Only 1 model appropriately assessed calibration. All models had high risk of bias; 4 of 10 general models and 5 of 7 infection models had low concern for applicability for general medical patients.
Conclusion
Mortality prediction models for general medical patients were sparse and differed in quality, applicability, and discrimination. These models require hospital-level validation and/or recalibration in general medical patients to guide mortality reduction interventions.

AB  - Objective
The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing health disparities. To provide a historical perspective on health disparities for pandemic acute respiratory viruses, we conducted a scoping review of the public health literature of health disparities in influenza outcomes during the 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 influenza pandemics.
Methods
We searched for articles examining socioeconomic or racial/ethnic disparities in any population, examining any influenza-related outcome (e.g., incidence, hospitalizations, mortality), during the 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 influenza pandemics. We conducted a structured search of English-written articles in PubMed supplemented by a snowball of articles meeting inclusion criteria.
Results
A total of 29 articles met inclusion criteria, all but one focusing exclusively on the 1918 or 2009 pandemics. Individuals of low socioeconomic status, or living in low socioeconomic status areas, experienced higher incidence, hospitalizations, and mortality in the 1918 and 2009 pandemics. There were conflicting results regarding racial/ethnic disparities during the 1918 pandemic, with differences in magnitude and direction by outcome, potentially due to issues in data quality by race/ethnicity. Racial/ethnic minorities had generally higher incidence, mortality, and hospitalization rates in the 1957 and 2009 pandemics.
Conclusion
Individuals of low socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic minorities have historically experienced worse influenza outcomes during pandemics. These historical patterns can inform current research to understand disparities in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of death worldwide, with 1.5 million deaths in 2020. While TB incidence and mortality had previously been on a downwards trend, in 2020, TB mortality actually rose for the first time in a decade, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Undernutrition is the leading risk factor for TB, with a population attributable fraction (PAF) of 15%, compared to 7.6% for HIV. Individuals who are undernourished are more likely to develop active TB compared to those with a healthy bodyweight. They are also more likely to have greater severity of TB, and less likely to have successful TB treatment outcomes. The likelihood of TB mortality significantly increases as weight decreases. Nutritional interventions are likely to improve both nutritional status and TB treatment success, thereby decreasing TB mortality. However, many previous studies focusing on nutritional interventions have provided insufficient calories or been underpowered.Nutritional supplementation will be particularly important as factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and political conflict further threaten food security. The global TB elimination effort can no longer afford to ignore undernutrition.

AB  - Summary
Antimicrobial resistance remains a significant global public health threat. Although development of novel antibiotics can be challenging, several new antibiotics with improved activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms have recently been commercialised. Expanding access to these antibiotics is a global public health priority that should be coupled with improving access to quality diagnostics, health care with adequately trained professionals, and functional antimicrobial stewardship programmes. This comprehensive approach is essential to ensure responsible use of these new antibiotics.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread across the world, testing each nation’s ability to understand the state of the pandemic in their country and control it. As we looked into the epidemiological data to uncover the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we discovered that critical metadata is missing which is meant to give context to epidemiological parameters. In this review, we identify key metadata for the COVID-19 fatality rate after a thorough analysis of mathematical models, serology-informed studies and determinants of causes of death for the COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, we find reasons to establish a set of standard-based guidelines to record and report the data from epidemiological studies. Additionally, we discuss why standardizing nomenclature is be a necessary component of these guidelines to improve communication and reproducibility. The goal of establishing these guidelines is to facilitate the interpretation of COVID-19 epidemiological findings and data by the general public, health officials, policymakers and fellow researchers. Our suggestions may not address all aspects of this issue; rather, they are meant to be the foundation for which experts can establish and encourage future guidelines throughout the appropriate communities.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Due to the immediate need for social distancing, as well as widespread disruption in clinical practices, brought on by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) pandemic, medical student education rapidly shifted to a virtual format, which resulted in a variety of innovative and remotely accessible practices to address new restrictions on face-to-face education. Educators approached curriculum design seeking to replicate as much of the in-person experience as possible, and were faced with overcoming the challenges of replacing the innately hands-on nature of surgery with virtual operative and skills experiences. Restrictions on in-person visiting electives expedited the role of virtual education as a notable opportunity for medical student education and recruitment, with a variety of approaches to engaging undergraduate medical learners, including the use of live-streaming operative cases, virtual didactic curricula, and a rise in podcasts; web-based conferences; and virtual journal clubs. In addition to education, virtual outreach to medical students has become an essential tool in trainee recruitment and selection, and ongoing application of novel educational platforms will allow for new opportunities in multi-institutional collaboration and exchange with a multitude of benefits to future vascular surgery trainees. Our aim was to outline the resources and practices used to virtually teach and recruit medical students and the benefits of virtual rotations to the program and students.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is a major public health concern, which has accounted for >1.7 million deaths across the world. A surge in the case fatality ratio as compared with the infection ratio has been observed in most of the countries. The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 shares the most common sequence with SARS-CoV, but it has a higher rate of transmission. The SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is initiated by the binding of viral spike protein with the target receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) facilitating virus internalization within host cells. SARS-CoV-2 mainly causes alveolar damage ranging from mild to severe clinical respiratory manifestations. Most of the cases have revealed the association of Coronavirus disease with patients having earlier comorbidities like Hypertension, Diabetes mellitus, and Cerebrovascular diseases. Pharmacological investigation of the SARS-Cov-2 patients has revealed the frequent use of drugs belongs to Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and/or Angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARBs). Interestingly, a significant increase in ACE2 expression was noticed in patients routinely treated with the above group of drugs were also reported. To date, the association of ACEi and/or ARBs with the up-regulation of ACE2 expression has not been defined distinctively. The proposed review will focus on the pathways which are responsible for the upregulation of ACE2 and its impact on gravity of SARS-CoV-2 disease.

AB  - Purpose
To review the scientific literature seeking lessons for the COVID-19 era that could be learned from previous health services interruptions that affected the delivery of cancer screening services.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted up to April 17, 2020, with no restrictions on language or dates and resulted in 385 articles. Two researchers independently assessed the list and discussed any disagreements. Once a consensus was achieved for each paper, those selected were included in the review.
Results
Eleven articles were included. Three studies were based in Japan, two in the United States, one in South Korea, one in Denmark, and the remaining four offered a global perspective on interruptions in health services due to natural or human-caused disasters. No articles covered an interruption due to a pandemic. The main themes identified in the reviewed studies were coordination, communication, resource availability and patient follow-up.
Conclusion
Lessons learned applied to the context of COVID-19 are that coordination involving partners across the health sector is essential to optimize resources and resume services, making them more resilient while preparing for future interruptions. Communication with the general population about how COVID-19 has affected cancer screening, measures taken to mitigate it and safely re-establish screening services is recommended. Use of mobile health systems to reach patients who are not accessing services and the application of resource-stratified guidelines are important considerations. More research is needed to explore best strategies for suspending, resuming and sustaining cancer screening programs, and preparedness for future disruptions, adapted to diverse health care systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) are anti-malarial drugs frequently used in the rheumatologic field. They were recently identified as potential therapeutic options for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). The present study aims to map and grade the diverse health outcomes associated with HCQ/CQ using an umbrella review approach.
METHODS
Umbrella review of systematic reviews of observational and intervention studies. For observational studies, random-effects summary effect size, 95% confidence interval, and 95% prediction interval were estimated. We also assessed heterogeneity, evidence for small-study effect, and evidence for excess significance bias. The quality of evidence was then graded using validated criteria from highly convincing to weak. The evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool.
RESULTS
From 313 articles returned in the literature search, six meta-analyses were included (n = 25 outcomes). Among meta-analyses (MAs) of observational studies, HCQ/CQ are weakly associated with a reduced risk for cardiovascular events and diabetes when used for autoimmune diseases and with spontaneous abortion; they are also associated with a higher risk of death in COVID-19 patients. Among MAs of RCTs, HCQ/CQ are associated with an improvement of articular manifestations of rheumatic diseases.
CONCLUSIONS
There is high evidence of the efficacy of HCQ/CQ in the rheumatologic field. The lack of evidence for efficacy and the risk of death associated with the use of HCQ/CQ for COVID-19 indicate the inappropriateness of their inclusion in recent COVID-19 therapy guidelines and the urgent need for RCTs to determine eventual appropriateness as a COVID-19 therapy.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease that causes hyperglycemia. In COVID-19 patients the severity of the disease depends on myriad factors but diabetes mellitus is the most important comorbidity. The current review was conducted to investigate the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and disease severity of COVID-19 in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and relevant treatment. The literature published in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was reviewed up to September 2021. The keywords including SARS-CoV-2, type 2 diabetes mellitus in COVID-19, hyperglycemia in COVID-19, opportunistic infections in type 2 diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 were used in different combinations. Hyperglycemic individuals over-express ACE-2 receptors in the lungs thus increasing the SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and replication. Although dipeptidyl peptidase-4 plays an important role in glucose homeostasis, additionally it also stimulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α creating a cytokine storm. Cytokine storm might be responsible for respiratory insufficiency in severe COVID-19 patients. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with immunosuppression and the patients are prone to get many opportunistic infections. Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with severe COVID-19 have lymphopenia. Moreover, in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients the neutrophils exhibit decreased chemotaxis, hydrogen peroxide production, and phagocytosis. Reduction in lymphocyte count and defective neutrophil capacity renders them with COVID-19 susceptible to opportunistic bacterial and fungal infections increasing the mortality rate. The opportunistic bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients were due to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia, and coagulase-negative Staphylococci, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella sp. In COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, mucormycosis was found to be the most common fungal infection with a higher predilection to males. Hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus enhances the SARS-CoV-2 replication with an adverse outcome. A strong correlation exists between the poor prognosis of COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Proper glycemic control in COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus might lessen the severity of the disease.

AB  - The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was first discovered in Wuhan (China) in December 2019 and belongs to the same family as that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Diagnosis of this disease is carried out by using special molecular tests. It is mandatory to identify the individual with COVID-19 symptoms, and isolation is necessary to prevent further transmission of this virus. This review highlights the formation, prodrome, transmission and survival mechanism of COVID-19 and shows that the pandemic circumstance fundamentally improves the air quality in various urban areas across the globe, decreases water contamination and commotion and diminishes the tension on the traveller objections, which may facilitate the reclamation of the natural framework. The worldwide effect of this new outbreak is still dubious.

AB  - Summary
Health-care workers are crucial to any health-care system. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, health-care workers are at a substantially increased risk of becoming infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and could come to considerable harm as a result. Depending on the phase of the pandemic, patients with COVID-19 might not be the main source of SARS-CoV-2 infection and health-care workers could be exposed to atypical patients, infected family members, contacts, and colleagues, or live in communities of active transmission. Clear strategies to support and appropriately manage exposed and infected health-care workers are essential to ensure effective staff management and to engender trust in the workplace. These management strategies should focus on risk stratification, suitable clinical monitoring, low-threshold access to diagnostics, and decision making about removal from and return to work. Policy makers need to support health-care facilities in interpreting guidance during a pandemic that will probably be characterised by fluctuating local incidence of SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the impact of this pandemic on their workforce.

These data along with an age-dependent disease susceptibility and mortality in the elderly suggest that sex hormones are the main factors in determining the clinical course of the infection. The differences in aging males versus females and the role of sex hormones in key phenotypes of COVID-19 infection are described in this review. Recommendations based on a dimorphic approach for males and females suggest a sex-specific management the disease.

AB  - Emergency management of the emerging infectious disease outbreak is critical for public health threats. Currently, control of the COVID-19 outbreak is an international concern and has become a crucial challenge in many countries. This article reviews significant information technologyIT) applications in emergency management of COVID-19 by considering the prevention/mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery phases of the crisis. This review was conducted using MEDLINE PubMed), Embase, IEEE, and Google Scholar. Expert opinions were collected to show existence gaps, useful technologies for each phase of emergency management, and future direction. Results indicated that various IT-based systems such as surveillance systems, artificial intelligence, computational methods, Internet of things, remote sensing sensor, online service, and GIS geographic information system) could have different outbreak management applications, especially in response phases. Information technology was applied in several aspects, such as increasing the accuracy of diagnosis, early detection, ensuring healthcare providers’ safety, decreasing workload, saving time and cost, and drug discovery. We categorized these applications into four core topics, including diagnosis and prediction, treatment, protection, and management goals, which were confirmed by five experts. Without applying IT, the control and management of the crisis could be difficult on a large scale. For reducing and improving the hazard effect of disaster situations, the role of IT is inevitable. In addition to the response phase, communities should be considered to use IT capabilities in prevention, preparedness, and recovery phases. It is expected that IT will have an influential role in the recovery phase of COVID-19. Providing IT infrastructure and financial support by the governments should be more considered in facilitating IT capabilities.

AB  - Throughout the past 2020, the pandemic COVID-19 has caused a big global shock, meanwhile it brought a great impact on the public health network. Trauma emergency system faced a giant challenge and how to manage trauma under the pandemic of COVID-19 was widely discussed. However, the trauma treatment of special population (geriatric patients and patients taking anticoagulant drugs) has received inadequate attention. Due to the high mortality following severe traumatic hemorrhage, hemostasis and trauma-induced coagulopathy are the important concerns in trauma treatment. Sepsis is another topic should not be ignored when we talking about trauma. COVID-19 itself is a special kind of sepsis, and it may even be called as serious systemic infection syndrome. Sepsis has been become a serious problem waiting to be solved urgently no matter in the fields of trauma, or in intensive care and infection, etc. This article reviewed the research progress in areas including trauma emergency care, trauma bleeding and coagulation, geriatric trauma and basic research of trauma within 2020.

The present Clinical Opinion represents a summary of the epidemiological evidence and possible pathophysiological mechanisms regarding PCOS and COVID-19. PCOS women could be more susceptible to infections compared to non-PCOS women. Insulin resistance and the associated hyperinsulinaemia are drivers for enhanced steroidogenesis in women with PCOS. Weight-gain and obesity, through their worsening effects on insulin resistance, thereby drive enhanced steroidogenesis and hyperandrogenism. All these features represent key points to provide an explanation for the possible association between PCOS and SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, androgens may drive clinical results in COVID-19, through the expression of TMPRSS2, a cellular co-receptor necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection and through androgen-mediated immune modulation. In women with PCOS the endocrine-immune axis leads to immune dysfunction with a state of chronic inflammation, and hyperandrogenism and IR with compensatory hyperglycaemia could play a determining role in the pathophysiogenesis of the infection. However, it is possible that only specific PCOS phenotypes may be more susceptible. In addition, vitamin D deficiency and gut dysbiosis are another important factor potentially involved in the increased risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 in PCOS women. Further scientific investigations are needed with the aim of understanding which women are most at risk of becoming infected or developing complications, what are the causal mechanisms on which it is possible to intervene with prophylactic and therapeutic measures and what the long-term consequences will be on the health of these patients.

AB  - Obesity is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19, yet there remains a lack of consensus on the mechanisms underlying this relationship. A hypothesis that has garnered considerable attention suggests that SARS-CoV-2 disrupts adipose tissue function, either through direct infection or by indirect mechanisms. Indeed, recent reports have begun to shed some light on the important role that the adipose tissue plays during the acute phase of infection, as well as mediating long-term sequelae. In this review, we examine the evidence of extrapulmonary dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 to the adipose tissue. We discuss the mechanisms, acute and long-term implications, and possible management strategies to limit or ameliorate severe disease and long-term metabolic disturbances.

AB  - Background
The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has disrupted the delivery of safe surgical care worldwide. One specific aspect of global surgical care that has been severely limited is the ability for physicians and trainees to participate in global surgical outreach programs in low- and middle-income countries.
Methods
A narrative review of the literature regarding global surgical outreach programs during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic was performed. Factors that must be considered in the reinstatement of global surgical outreach programs were identified, and suggestions to address them were provided based on the available literature and the experiences of the senior authors.
Results
As global surgical outreach programs were canceled at the start of the pandemic, many academic surgeons turned to digital solutions to continue to engage with low- and middle-income country partners. With the advent of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines and improved access to testing and treatment worldwide, the recommencement of global surgical outreach programs may begin to be considered. Important considerations before initiation include vaccine and testing availability for visiting providers, local staff, and patients, local hospital capacity, staff and equipment shortages, and the characteristics of the patient population and visiting providers. Region- and country-specific factors, including local infection rates and concomitant health crises, must also be taken into account. Expansion of digital collaborative efforts may further deepen international connections and promote sustainable models of care.
Conclusion
With careful consideration, global surgical outreach programs may begin to be safely restarted in the near future. The current article evaluates individual factors that must be considered to safely restart global surgical outreach programs as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is better controlled.

AB  - Like other infectious diseases, COVID-19 shows a clinical outcome enormously variable, ranging from asymptomatic to lethal. In Italy, like in other countries, old male individuals, with one or more comorbidity, are the most susceptible group, and show, consequently, the highest mortality, and morbidity, including lethal respiratory distress syndrome, as the most common complication. In addition, another extraordinary peculiarity, that is a surprising resistance to COVID-19, characterizes some Italian nonagenarians/centenarians. Despite having the typical COVID-19 signs and/or symptoms, such exceptional individuals show a surprising tendency to recover from illness and complications. On the other hand, long-lived people have an optimal performance of immune system related to an overexpression of anti-inflammatory variants in immune/inflammatory genes, as demonstrated by our and other groups. Consequently, we suggest long-lived people as an optimal model for detecting genetic profiles associated with the susceptibility and/or protection to COVID-19, to utilize as potential pharmacological targets for preventing or reducing viral infection in more vulnerable individuals.

AB  - This study analyzes the impact of malnutrition on infant mortality and life expectancy in a sample of 36 African countries during the 2003 to 2018 period. The economic implications of malnutrition are examined through the vicious cycle of poverty, malnutrition, low productivity, and further malnutrition. It was hypothesized that malnutrition at infancy contributes to high mortality and leads to lower labor productivity in adults through the reduction of their life span, because more and more skilled laborers leave sooner. The results of the two-way, fixed-effect panel model strongly showed that mild or moderate malnutrition reduces infant mortality, whereas severe malnutrition leads to an increase in deaths among children under 5 y. The results show a mitigated impact of malnutrition on life expectancy. Also, growth in the gross domestic product significantly reduced the infant mortality rate, but any increase in income per capita was not followed by a reduction of death in children. Thus, it is recommended 1) to strengthen the entire health system and infrastructure, 2) to promote nutritional training programs, and 3) to reinforce the fight against infectious diseases that mostly affect children.

AB  - Summary
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) inflicts significant mortality, morbidity and economic loss in the 11 countries in the WHO South-East Asia Region (SEAR). With technical assistance and advocacy from WHO, all countries have developed their respective National Action Plans on AMR that are aligned with the Global Action Plan. Historically, the WHO Regional Office has been proactive in advocacy at the highest political level. The past decade has seen an enhancement of the country’s capacity to combat AMR through national efforts catalyzed and supported through several WHO initiatives at all levels—global, regional and country levels. Several countries including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have observed a worrying trend of increasing drug resistance, despite heightened awareness and actions. Recent AMR data generated by the countries are indicative of fragmented progress. Lack of technical capacity, financial resources, weak regulatory apparatus, slow behavioural changes at all levels of the antimicrobial stewardship landscape and the COVID-19 pandemic have prevented the effective application of several interventions to minimize the impact of AMR.

AB  - The emergence of Mucorales infections is an urgent global public health threat rapidly disseminating during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Invasive mucormycosis carries significant morbidity and mortality; this is further compounded by the lack of newer effective antifungals on the horizon. Liposomal Amphotericin (L-AMB) is currently considered the cornerstone of antifungals therapy against mucormycosis; However, two decades later (since the introduction of L-AMB), the outcome remains dismal. Furthermore, adverse events related to therapeutic doses of L-AMB are also a hindrance. There is an imperative need for an alternative therapeutic approach to reduce the high mortality. One such approach is to combine the amphotericin with other agents (e.g., caspofungin, posaconazole, isavuconazole, and iron chelators) that can work synergistically or help in reducing the therapeutic doses of L-AMB. This review aims to highlight the various treatment approaches by gathering the clinical evidence from the literature and considering all potential pharmacological combinations that can provide the direction for future studies.

AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is largely the result of a dysregulated host response, followed by damage to alveolar cells and lung fibrosis. Exacerbated proinflammatory cytokines release (cytokine storm) and loss of T lymphocytes (leukopenia) characterize the most aggressive presentation. We propose that a multifaceted anti-inflammatory strategy based on pharmacological activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (NRF2) can be deployed against the virus. The strategy provides robust cytoprotection by restoring redox and protein homeostasis, promoting resolution of inflammation, and facilitating repair. NRF2 activators such as sulforaphane and bardoxolone methyl are already in clinical trials. The safety and efficacy information of these modulators in humans, together with their well-documented cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical models, highlight the potential of this armamentarium for deployment to the battlefield against COVID-19.

AB  - Background and aims
The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a systemic disease. Mounting evidence depict signs and symptoms involving multiple organs, most of which supported by pathological data. A plausible link to these manifestations is vascular and endothelial dysfunction/damage. However, much of the current knowledge relies on opinion and incipient evidence. We aim to objectively appraise current evidence on the association between COVID-19 and vascular disease, specifically endotheliitis and vasculitis.
Methods
Two researchers independently entered the search terms COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND vasculitis, endotheliitis OR endothelium in the following online platforms: MedRxiv and LitCovid (PubMed). The search period was set from November 1, 2019 to August 28, 2020. Manuscripts with unavailable full texts, not in English, mainly on pre-clinical data, presenting only study designs or not directly related to the topics of this review were excluded. Retrospective and prospective studies, especially longitudinal ones, were given priority to the purpose of this review. Since there was paucity of prospective controlled evidence, case reports/series were also considered.
Results
A total of 318 manuscripts were initially found. Sixty-seven (21%) were excluded: 59 (18.5%) met exclusion criteria and 8 (2.5%) were duplicates. One hundred and forty-two manuscripts (44,6%) did not provide original data and were also excluded: 35 (11%) were comments, 108 (33.9%) reviews; 1 (0.3%) position paper. One hundred and seven (33.6%) studies were considered for the present scoping review: 81 (25,5%) case reports/series; 18 (5.7%) prospective; 8 (2.5%) retrospective. Viral inclusions in endothelial cells, mononuclear cell infiltrates in the intima of small vessels and markers of endothelial cell apoptosis were demonstrated. Specificities of COVID-19 may lead to diverse vascular manifestations in different levels of the vascular bed.
Conclusions
Evidence indicates that COVID-19 targets vasculature and endothelium. However, high quality data is still lacking and studies with prospective designs and appropriately matched controls are needed.

AB  - Corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS CoV-2), a highly contagious single stranded RNA virus genetically related to SARS CoV. The lungs are the main organs affected leading to pneumonia and respiratory failure in severe cases that may need mechanical ventilation. Occasionally patient may present with gastro-intestinal, cardiac and neurologic symptoms with or without lung involvement. Pathologically, the lungs show either mild congestion and alveolar exudation or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with hyaline membrane or histopathology of acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia (AFOP) that parallels disease severity. Other organs like liver and kidneys may be involved secondarily. Currently the treatment is principally symptomatic and prevention by proper use of personal protective equipment and other measures is crucial to limit the spread. In the midst of pandemic there is paucity of literature on pathological features including pathogenesis, hence in this review we provide the current pathology centered understanding of COVID-19. Furthermore, the pathogenetic pathway is pivotal in the development of therapeutic targets.

AB  - In the 20th century, research focused on cholesterol and lipoproteins as the key mechanism in establishing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Given that some studies demonstrated subclinical atherosclerosis in subjects without conventional cardiovascular risk factors, the elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels alone cannot account for the entire burden of atherosclerosis. Hence, large-scale clinical trials demonstrated the operation of immune and inflammatory pathways in ASCVD. In this regard, the evidence establishes that cells of the immune system, both the innate (neutrophils, macrophages) and adaptive (T cell and other lymphocytes) limbs, contribute to atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis. Besides, basic science studies have identified proatherogenic cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-12, and IL-18. In this regard, some studies showed that antiinflammatory therapy targeting the immune system by modulating or blocking interleukins, also known as anti-cytokine therapy, can reduce the risk of major cardiovascular adverse events. The neutrophils play a key role in the innate immune system, representing the acute phase of an inflammatory response. In contrast, lymphocytes represent the adaptive immune system and promote the induction of autoimmune inflammation, especially in the chronic inflammatory response. Through the literature review, we will highlight the inflammatory pathway for the physiopathology of ASCVD, HF, and COVID-19. In this regard, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) integrates the innate immune and adaptive immune systems, making the NLR a biomarker of inflammation. In addition, we provided an update on the evidence showing that high NLR is associated with worse prognosis in heart failure (HF), ASCVD, and COVID-19, as well as their clinical applications showing that the normalization of NLR after anti-cytokine therapy is a potential predictor of therapy responsiveness and is associated with reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events.

AB  - Fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) are among the most commonly used tests for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs worldwide. However, no randomised controlled trials have been carried out evaluating the impact of FIT-based screening programs (FIT-progr) on CRC incidence and mortality rates. Italian FIT-progr represent one of the most widespread and established experience worldwide. This paper reviews the evidence on the impact of FIT-progr on CRC incidence, tumor stage at diagnosis, mortality and surgery rates, deriving from Italian routine programs, i.e., outside the research setting. Unfortunately, the application of FIT-progr in Italy can be considered as an unplanned experimental model, due to the differences between Regions, both in health system management and adherence of the target population to the screening programs. The analysis of the manuscripts considered in the review, confirms that FIT-progr are effective in reducing CRC incidence and mortality rates and in improving the rate of endoscopic treatment of early invasive lesions. The review also highlights that FIT-progr are less performing for proximal colon than for distal colon and rectum.

AB  - In 2019, the world faced a serious health challenge, the rapid spreading of a life-threatening viral pneumonia, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of January 2022 WHO statistics shows more than 5.6 million death and about 350 million infection by SARS-CoV-2. One of the life threatening aspects of COVID-19 is secondary infections and reduced efficacy of antibiotics against them. Since the beginning of COVID-19 many researches have been done on identification, treatment, and vaccine development. Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) could offer novel approaches to detect, treat and control COVID-19. Phage therapy and in particular using phage cocktails can be used to control or eliminate the bacterial pathogen as an alternative or complementary therapeutic agent. At the same time, phage interaction with the host immune system can regulate the inflammatory response. In addition, phage display and engineered synthetic phages can be utilized to develop new vaccines and antibodies, stimulate the immune system, and elicit a rapid and well-appropriate defense response. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 new variants like delta and omicron has proved the urgent need for precise, efficient and novel approaches for vaccine development and virus detection techniques in which bacteriophages may be one of the plausible solutions. Therefore, phages with similar morphology and/or genetic content to that of coronaviruses can be used for ecological and epidemiological modeling of SARS-CoV-2 behavior and future generations of coronavirus, and in general new viral pathogens. This article is a comprehensive review/perspective of potential applications of bacteriophages in the fight against the present pandemic and the post-COVID era.

AB  - In the last two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has undeniably changed everyday life and significantly reshaped the healthcare systems. Besides the direct effect on daily care leading to significant excess mortality, several collateral damages have been observed during the pandemic. The impact of the pandemic led to staff shortages, disrupted education, worse healthcare professional well-being, and a lack of proper clinical training and research. In this review we highlight the results of these important changes and how can the healthcare systems can adapt to prevent unprecedented events in case of future catastrophes.

AB  - Summary
Most countries have made little progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.4, which calls for a reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by a third from 2015 to 2030. In this Health Policy paper, we synthesise the evidence related to interventions that can reduce premature mortality from the major NCDs over the next decade and that are feasible to implement in countries at all levels of income. Our recommendations are intended as generic guidance to help 123 low-income and middle-income countries meet SDG target 3.4; country-level applications require additional analyses and consideration of the local implementation and utilisation context. Protecting current investments and scaling up these interventions is especially crucial in the context of COVID-19-related health system disruptions. We show how cost-effectiveness data and other information can be used to define locally tailored packages of interventions to accelerate rates of decline in NCD mortality. Under realistic implementation constraints, most countries could achieve (or almost achieve) the NCD target using a combination of these interventions; the greatest gains would be for cardiovascular disease mortality. Implementing the most efficient package of interventions in each world region would require, on average, an additional US$18 billion annually over 2023–30; this investment could avert 39 million deaths and generate an average net economic benefit of $2·7 trillion, or $390 per capita. Although specific clinical intervention pathways would vary across countries and regions, policies to reduce behavioural risks, such as tobacco smoking, harmful use of alcohol, and excess sodium intake, would be relevant in nearly every country, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the health gains of any locally tailored NCD package. By 2030, ministries of health would need to contribute about 20% of their budgets to high-priority NCD interventions. Our report concludes with a discussion of financing and health system implementation considerations and reflections on the NCD agenda beyond the SDG target 3.4 and beyond the SDG period.

AB  - The novel corona virus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread throughout the globe at a formidable speed, causing tens of millions of cases and more than one million deaths in less than a year of its report in December 2019. Since then, companies and research institutions have raced to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, ranging from conventional viral and protein-based vaccines to those that are more cutting edge, including DNA- and mRNA-based vaccines. Each vaccine exhibits a different potency and duration of efficacy, as determined by the antigen design, adjuvant molecules, vaccine delivery platforms, and immunization method. In this review, we will introduce a few of the leading non-viral vaccines that are under clinical stage development and discuss delivery strategies to improve vaccine efficacy, duration of protection, safety, and mass vaccination.

AB  - Whether non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a cardiovascular (CV) risk factor is debated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the CV morbidity and mortality related to NAFLD in the general population, and to determine whether CV risk is comparable between lean and non-lean NAFLD phenotypes. We searched multiple databases, including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, for observational studies published through 2022 that reported the risk of CV events and mortality. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality, CV mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF), and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were assessed through random-effect meta-analysis. We identified 33 studies and a total study population of 10,592,851 individuals (mean age 53±8; male sex 50%; NAFLD 2, 9%). Mean follow-up was 10±6 years. Pooled ORs for all-cause and CV mortality were respectively 1.14 (95% CI, 0.78-1.67) and 1.13 (95% CI, 0.57-2.23), indicating no significant association between NAFLD and mortality. NAFLD was associated with increased risk of MI (OR 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5-1.7), stroke (OR: 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1), atrial fibrillation (OR: 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.3), and MACCE (OR: 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2). Compared with non-lean NAFLD, lean NAFLD was associated with increased CV mortality (OR: 1.50; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0), but similar all-cause mortality and risk of MACCE. While NAFLD may not be a risk factor for total and CV mortality, it is associated with excess risk of non-fatal CV events. Lean and non-lean NAFLD phenotypes exhibit distinct prognostic profiles and should receive equitable clinical care.

AB  - With the emergence of COVID-19 vaccines, individuals with comorbidities and immunosuppression require particular attention and should be prioritized for vaccination. However, the majority of vaccine clinical trials excluded people with comorbidities, resulting in a lack of data regarding vaccine efficacy in this demographic. Along with more inclusivity in clinical trials, reaching a definitive conclusion regarding vaccine efficacy in these patients is also crucial. In our review, we highlight the BNT162b2 vaccine safety and efficacy based on the limited number of clinical trials which included this demographic. We also provide vaccine considerations for individuals with cancer, autoimmune diseases, HIV, obesity, diabetes, organ transplant recipients and those undergoing maintenance haemodialysis to help them govern their decision regarding vaccine administration. In conclusion, further studies are required to alleviate any insecurities in patients with comorbidities regarding vaccination and it is recommended that patients are monitored post-vaccination to make sure sufficient immunity is achieved.

AB  - Purpose
Owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, radiation oncology departments have adopted various strategies to deliver radiation therapy safely and efficiently while minimizing the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus–2 transmission among patients and health care providers. One practical strategy is to deliver stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in a single fraction, which has been well established for treating bone metastases, although it has been infrequently used for other extracranial sites.
Methods and Materials
A PubMed search of published articles in English related to single-fraction SBRT was performed. A critical review was performed of the articles that described clinical outcomes of single-fraction SBRT for treatment of primary extracranial cancers and oligometastatic extraspinal disease.
Results
Single-fraction SBRT for peripheral early-stage non-small cell lung cancer is supported by randomized data and is strongly endorsed during the COVID-19 pandemic by the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology-American Society for Radiation Oncology practice guidelines. Prospective and retrospective studies supporting a single-fraction regimen are limited, although outcomes are promising for renal cell carcinoma, liver metastases, and adrenal metastases. Data are immature for primary prostate cancer and demonstrate excess late toxicity in primary pancreatic cancer.
Conclusions
Single-fraction SBRT should be strongly considered for peripheral early-stage non-small cell lung cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate the potentially severe consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus–2 transmission. Although single-fraction SBRT is promising for the definitive treatment of other primary or oligometastatic cancers, multi-fraction SBRT should be the preferred regimen owing to the need for additional prospective evaluation to determine long-term efficacy and safety.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is complicated by significant coagulopathy, that manifests in the form of both pulmonary artery microthromboses and systemic venous thromboembolism (VTE) leading to excess mortality. Dysregulated innate immune response in the lung due to viral-entry mediated angiotensin-I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor downregulation causes endothelial injury in the pulmonary vasculature, inflammatory cytokine release, increased thrombin generation and impaired fibrinolysis. The inflammatory disease process, immobilization with prolonged hospital stay, hypoxia due to extensive lung injury and pre-existing comorbidities can contribute to thromboembolic episodes (TE). The observed risk for TE in COVID-19 is high despite anticoagulation, particularly in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A high level of clinical suspicion, lower threshold for diagnostic imaging and aggressive early and extended thromboprophylaxis is indicated. The available evidence on the optimal strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat VTE in patients with COVID-19 is heterogenous, but rapidly evolving. We propose an evidence-based, risk-stratified protocol in approaching the risk of TE episodes in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Summary
The increased prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk factors in people hospitalized with severe COVID-19 illness has engendered considerable interest in the metabolic aspects of SARS-CoV-2-induced pathophysiology. Here, I update concepts informing how metabolic disorders and their co-morbidities modify the susceptibility to, natural history, and potential treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a focus on human biology. New data informing genetic predisposition, epidemiology, immune responses, disease severity, and therapy of COVID-19 in people with obesity and diabetes are highlighted. The emerging relationships of metabolic disorders to viral-induced immune responses and viral persistence, and the putative importance of adipose and islet ACE2 expression, glycemic control, cholesterol metabolism, and glucose- and lipid-lowering drugs is reviewed, with attention to controversies and unresolved questions. Rapid progress in these areas informs our growing understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with diabetes and obesity, while refining the therapeutic strategies and research priorities in this vulnerable population.

AB  - The effects of obesity and smoking in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remain controversial. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), is the human cell receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. ACE2 expression increases on lung alveolar epithelial cells and adipose tissue due to obesity, smoking and air pollution. A significant relationship exists between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection, as more severe COVID-19 symptoms occur in smokers; comorbid conditions due to obesity or excess ectopic fat accumulation as underlying risk factors for severe COVID-19 strongly encourage the virus/ACE2 receptor-ligand interaction concept. Indeed, obesity, air pollution and smoking associated risk factors share underlying pathophysiologies that are related to the Renin-Angiotensin-System in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this review is to emphasize the mechanism of receptor-ligand interaction and its impact on the enhanced risk of death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Consumption of alcohol in excess leads to substantial medical, economic, and societal burdens. Approximately 5.3% of all global deaths may be attributed to alcohol consumption. Moreover, the burden of alcohol associated liver disease (ALD) accounts for 5.1% of all disease and injury worldwide. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects men more than women globally with significant years of life loss to disability in low, middle and well-developed countries. Precise data on global estimates of alcohol related steatosis, alcohol related hepatitis, and alcohol related cirrhosis have been challenging to obtain. In the United States (US), alcohol related steatosis has been estimated at 4.3% based on NHANES data which has remained stable over 14 years. However, alcohol-related fibrotic liver disease has increased over the same period. In those with AUD, the prevalence of alcohol related hepatitis has been estimated at 10–35%. Globally, the prevalence of alcohol-associated cirrhosis has been estimated at 23.6 million individuals for compensated cirrhosis and 2.46 million for those with decompensated cirrhosis. The contribution of ALD to global mortality and disease burden of liver related deaths is substantial. In 2016 liver disease related to AUD contributed to 50% of the estimated liver disease deaths for age groups 15 years and above. Data from the US report high cost burdens associated with those admitted with alcohol-related liver complications. Finally, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with marked increase in alcohol consumption worldwide and will likely increase the burden of ALD.

AB  - Background
In the general adult population, lymphopaenia is associated with an increased risk for hospitalisation with infection and infection-related death. The quality of evidence and strength of association between perioperative lymphopaenia across different surgical procedures and mortality/morbidity has not been examined by systematic review or meta-analysis.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases from their inception to June 29, 2020 for observational studies reporting lymphocyte count and in-hospital mortality rate in adults. We defined preoperative lymphopaenia as a lymphocyte count 1.0–1.5×109 L−1. Meta-analysis was performed using either fixed or random effects models. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. The I2 index was used to quantify heterogeneity. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality rate and mortality rate at 30 days.
Results
Eight studies met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis, comprising 4811 patients (age range, 46–91 yr; female, 20–79%). These studies examined preoperative lymphocyte count exclusively. Studies were of moderate to high quality overall, ranking >7 using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Preoperative lymphopaenia was associated with a threefold increase in mortality rate (risk ratio [RR]=3.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.19–4.72; P<0.01, I2=0%) and more frequent major postoperative complications (RR=1.33; 95% CI, 1.21–1.45; P<0.01, I2=6%), including cardiovascular morbidity (RR=1.77; 95% CI, 1.45–2.15; P<0.01, I2=0%), infections (RR=1.45; 95% CI, 1.19–1.76; P<0.01, I2=0%), and acute renal dysfunction (RR=2.66; 95% CI, 1.49–4.77; P<0.01, I2=1%).
Conclusion
Preoperative lymphopaenia is associated with death and complications more frequently, independent of the type of surgery.

AB  - Currently, the apparition of new SARS-CoV, known as SARS-CoV-2, affected more than 34 million people and causing high death rates worldwide. Recently, several studies reported SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in hospital wastewater. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted between humans via respiratory droplets, close contact and fomites. Fecal-oral transmission is considered also as a potential route of transmission since several scientists confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces of infected patients, therefore its transmission via feces in aquatic environment, particularly hospital wastewater. Hospitals are one of the important classes of polluting sectors around the world. It was identified that hospital wastewater contains hazardous elements and a wide variety of microbial pathogens and viruses. Therefore, this may potentially pose a significant risk of public health and environment infection. This study reported an introduction about the Physical-chemical and microbiological characterization of hospital wastewater, which can be a route to identify potential technology to reduce the impact of hospital contaminants before evacuation. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in aqueous environment was reviewed. The knowledge of the detection and survival of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and hospital wastewater were described to understand the different routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, which is also useful to avoid the outbreak of CoV-19. In addition, disinfection technologies used commonly for deactivation of SARS-CoV-2 were highlighted. It was revealed that, chlorine-containing disinfectants are the most commonly used disinfectants in this field of research. Meanwhile, other efficient technologies must be developed and improved to avoid another wave of the pandemic of COVID-19 infections.

AB  - Purpose
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, affecting over 523 million people globally. Atherosclerotic diseases, particularly ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, are the primary mediators of CVD burden and trends, with half of CVD deaths attributed to IHD, and another quarter to ischemic stroke. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of world-wide trends in the burden of atherosclerotic CVD.
Methods
A literature review of published studies reporting regional or global trends or burden of CVD was undertaken, with a specific focus on atherosclerotic-mediated CVDs.
Findings
While long-term trends in age-standardized rates of CVD mortality and incidence indicate substantial declines in disease burden, the impact of population growth and ageing has contributed to a continued increase in the absolute number of people living with CVD. Additionally, when data are restricted to the most recent decade, there are indications that even declines in age-standardized CVD rates may have attenuated. Trends are also heterogeneous across countries and regions, with a relative increase in CVD burden in developing countries and differing trends within countries. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in substantial short-term reductions in hospitalization rates for major atherosclerotic CVDs including acute coronary syndromes and heart failure in some countries.
Implications
Recent attenuation of declines in atherosclerotic CVDs with increasing absolute burden has significant implications for health systems and resource availability, with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on longer-term trends in CVD yet to be clearly established.

AB  - This review article summarizes the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and its receptors (EP1-EP4) as it relates to the inflammatory cardiomyopathy, myocarditis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the onset of myocarditis in a subset of patients prompted a debate on the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like ibuprofen, which act to inhibit the actions of prostaglandins. This review aims to further understanding of the role of PGE2 in the pathogenesis or protection of the myocardium in myocarditis. Inflammatory cardiomyopathies encompass a broad spectrum of disorders, all characterized by cardiac inflammation. Therefore, for the purpose of this review, the authors have placed particular emphasis on etiologies of myocarditis where effects of PGE2 have been documented.

AB  - Summary
This Review, in addressing the unacceptably high mortality of patients with liver disease admitted to acute hospitals, reinforces the need for integrated clinical services. The masterplan described is based on regional, geographically sited liver centres, each linked to four to six surrounding district general hospitals—a pattern of care similar to that successfully introduced for stroke services. The plan includes the establishment of a lead and deputy lead clinician in each acute hospital, preferably a hepatologist or gastroenterologist with a special interest in liver disease, who will have prime responsibility for organising the care of admitted patients with liver disease on a 24/7 basis. Essential for the plan is greater access to intensive care units and high-dependency units, in line with the reconfiguration of emergency care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This Review strongly recommends full implementation of alcohol care teams in hospitals and improved working links with acute medical services. We also endorse recommendations from paediatric liver services to improve overall survival figures by diagnosing biliary atresia earlier based on stool colour charts and better caring for patients with impaired cognitive ability and developmental mental health problems. Pilot studies of earlier diagnosis have shown encouraging progress, with 5–6% of previously undiagnosed cases of severe fibrosis or cirrhosis identified through use of a portable FibroScan in primary care. Similar approaches to the detection of early asymptomatic disease are described in accounts from the devolved nations, and the potential of digital technology in improving the value of clinical consultation and screening programmes in primary care is highlighted. The striking contribution of comorbidities, particularly obesity and diabetes (with excess alcohol consumption known to be a major factor in obesity), to mortality in COVID-19 reinforces the need for fiscal and other long delayed regulatory measures to reduce the prevalence of obesity. These measures include the food sugar levy and the introduction of the minimum unit price policy to reduce alcohol consumption. Improving public health, this Review emphasises, will not only mitigate the severity of further waves of COVID-19, but is crucial to reducing the unacceptable burden from liver disease in the UK.

AB  - Importance: Among COVID-19 cases, especially the (frail) elderly show a high number of severe infections, hospital admissions, complications, and death. The highest mortality is found between 80 and 89 years old. Why do these patients have a higher risk of severe COVID-19? In this narrative review we address potential mechanisms regarding viral transmission, physical reserve and the immune system, increasing the severity of this infection in elderly patients. Observations: First, the spread of COVID-19 may be enhanced in elderly patients. Viral shedding may be increased, and early identification may be complicated due to atypical disease presentation and limited testing capacity. Applying hygiene and quarantine measures, especially in patients with cognitive disorders including dementia, can be challenging. Additionally, elderly patients have a decreased cardiorespiratory reserve and are more likely to have co-morbidity including atherosclerosis, rendering them more susceptible to complications. The aging innate and adaptive immune system is weakened, while there is a pro-inflammatory tendency. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the immune system on cytokine production and T-cells, further seem to aggravate this pro-inflammatory tendency, especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidity, increasing disease severity. Conclusions and relevance: The combination of all factors mentioned above contribute to the disease severity of COVID-19 in the older patient. While larger studies of COVID-19 in elderly patients are needed, understanding the factors increasing disease severity may improve care and preventative measures to protect the elderly patient at risk for (severe) COVID-19 in the future.

AB  - COVID-19 is a severe respiratory illness that has emerged as a devasting health problem worldwide. The disease outcome is heterogeneous, which is most likely dependent on the immunity of an individual. Asymptomatic and mildly/moderate symptomatic (non-severe) patients likely develop an effective early immune response and clear the virus. However, severe symptoms dominate due to a failure in the generation of an effective and specific early immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, a late surge in pathogenic inflammation involves dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses leading to local and systemic tissue damage and the emergence of severe disease symptoms. In this review, we describe the potential mechanisms of protective and pathogenic immune responses in “mild/moderate” and “severe” symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected people, respectively, and discuss the immune components that are currently targeted for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is a serious global health threat caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable with common hyperactivity of immune responses known as a “cytokine storm”. In fact, this massive release of inflammatory cytokines into in the pulmonary alveolar structure is a main cause of mortality during COVID-19 infection. Current management of COVID-19 is supportive and there is no common clinical protocol applied to suppress this pathological state. Lactoferrin (LF), an iron binding protein, is a first line defense protein that is present in neutrophils and excretory fluids of all mammals, and is well recognized for its role in maturation and regulation of immune system function. Also, due to its ability to sequester free iron, LF is known to protect against insult-induced oxidative stress and subsequent “cytokine storm” that results in dramatic necrosis within the affected tissue. Review of the literature strongly suggests utility of LF to silence the “cytokine storm”, giving credence to both prophylactic and therapeutic approaches towards combating COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Background
Adjuvant and neoadjuvant breast cancer treatments can reduce breast cancer mortality but may increase mortality from other causes. Information regarding treatment benefits and risks is scattered widely through the literature. To inform clinical practice we collated and reviewed the highest quality evidence.
Methods
Guidelines were searched to identify adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment options recommended in early invasive breast cancer. For each option, systematic literature searches identified the highest-ranking evidence. For radiotherapy risks, searches for dose–response relationships and modern organ doses were also undertaken.
Results
Treatment options recommended in the USA and elsewhere included chemotherapy (anthracycline, taxane, platinum, capecitabine), anti-human epidermal growth factor 2 therapy (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, trastuzumab emtansine, neratinib), endocrine therapy (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitor, ovarian ablation/suppression) and bisphosphonates. Radiotherapy options were after breast conserving surgery (whole breast, partial breast, tumour bed boost, regional nodes) and after mastectomy (chest wall, regional nodes). Treatment options were supported by randomised evidence, including > 10,000 women for eight treatment comparisons, 1,000–10,000 for fifteen and < 1,000 for one. Most treatment comparisons reduced breast cancer mortality or recurrence by 10–25%, with no increase in non-breast-cancer death. Anthracycline chemotherapy and radiotherapy increased overall non-breast-cancer mortality. Anthracycline risk was from heart disease and leukaemia. Radiation-risks were mainly from heart disease, lung cancer and oesophageal cancer, and increased with increasing heart, lung and oesophagus radiation doses respectively. Taxanes increased leukaemia risk.
Conclusions
These benefits and risks inform treatment decisions for individuals and recommendations for groups of women.

Studies have shown that infection with SARS-CoV-2 in cancer patients has a higher mortality rate than in people without cancer. Here, we have reviewed the evidence showing that gut microbiota plays an important role in health and is linked to colorectal cancer development. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a change in gut microbiota, which modify intestinal inflammation and barrier permeability and affects tumor-suppressor or oncogene genes, proposing SARS-CoV-2 as a potential contributor to CRC pathogenesis

AB  - Summary
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute respiratory illness characterised by bilateral chest radiographical opacities with severe hypoxaemia due to non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in ARDS and highlighted challenges associated with this syndrome, including its unacceptably high mortality and the lack of effective pharmacotherapy. In this Seminar, we summarise current knowledge regarding ARDS epidemiology and risk factors, differential diagnosis, and evidence-based clinical management of both mechanical ventilation and supportive care, and discuss areas of controversy and ongoing research. Although the Seminar focuses on ARDS due to any cause, we also consider commonalities and distinctions of COVID-19-associated ARDS compared with ARDS from other causes.

AB  - The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has overwhelmed health care systems in many countries. The clinical presentation of the SARS-CoV-2 varies between a subclinical or flu-like syndrome to that of severe pneumonia with multi-organ failure and death. Initial reports have suggested that cancer patients may have a higher susceptibility to get infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus but current evidence remains poor as it is biased by important confounders. Patients with ongoing or recent cancer treatment for advanced active disease, metastatic solid tumors and hematological malignancies are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 respiratory disease that requires hospitalization and have a poorer disease outcome compared to individuals without cancer. However it is not clear whether these are independent risk factors, or mainly driven by male gender, age, obesity, performance status, uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular disease and various other medical conditions. These often have a greater influence on the probability to die due to SARS-CoV-2 then cancer. Delayed diagnosis and suboptimal cancer management due to the pandemic results in disease upstaging and has considerable impact cancer on specific death rates. Surgery during the peak of the pandemic seems to increase mortality, but there is no convincing evidence that adjuvant systemic cancer therapy and radiotherapy are contraindicated, implicating that cancer treatment can be provided safely after individual risk/benefit assessment and some adaptive measures. Underlying immunosuppression, elevated cytokine levels, altered expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) and TMPRSS2, and a prothrombotic status may fuel the effects of a SARS-CoV-2 in some cancer patients, but have the potential to be used as biomarkers for severe disease and therapeutic targets. The rapidly expanding literature on COVID-19 should be interpreted with care as it is often hampered by methodological and statistical flaws.

AB  - The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)–related disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) has spread rapidly to a pandemic proportion, increasing the demands on health systems for the containment and management of COVID-19. Cancer has been reported as a major risk factor for adverse outcomes of and death from COVID-19. We extracted data from the World Health Organization's progress reports and from the Italian Council of Medicine. In addition, we retrieved clinical data on patients with cancer and with confirmed COVID-19 in our institution. As of 2nd April 2020, 110,574 COVID-19 cases and 13,157 deaths have been reported in Italy, representing a global share of 5.1% and 28.9% for incidence and mortality, respectively. In Italy, we report the analysis of the Italian Medical Council on 909 patients who died from COVID-19; of whom, 16.5% were patients with cancer. The population was enriched with subjects with multiple comorbid non-communicable diseases, with less than 1% of the population presenting no comorbid conditions. At the patient level, we identified nine patients referred to our department in the last two months who were receiving standard-of-care or experimental medications in the curative and palliative settings. The median age was 68 years (range = 42–79 years), and patients carried a median of one comorbid condition (0–2); two of nine patients presented with severe COVID-19 and were receiving inpatient care. None of the patients receiving immunotherapy experienced severe adverse outcomes, and four patients were discharged with complete reversal of the clinical syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Learning from the experience of countries with a high burden, efforts must be made to assure the access of patients with cancer to treatments, prioritising the cancer health interventions based on their intrinsic value and limiting the exposure to an unacceptable risk of infection for both health providers and patients. Any significant work in the design and implementation of health system actions, including clinical care, must be framed as an initiative under the global response agenda and through a community approach, with the intention of pursuing common goals to tackle COVID-19 and cancer, as ‘One Community’ working for ‘One Health's.

AB  - Objective
Since January 2020, the highly contagious novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic. Severe COVID-19 leads to a massive release of proinflammatory mediators, leading to diffuse damage to the lung parenchyma, and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Treatment with the highly potent glucocorticoid (GC) dexamethasone was found to be effective in reducing mortality in severely affected patients.
Methods
To review the effects of glucocorticoids in the context of COVID-19 we performed a literature search in the PubMed database using the terms COVID-19 and glucocorticoid treatment. We identified 1429 article publications related to COVID-19 and glucocorticoid published from 1.1.2020 to the present including 238 review articles and 36 Randomized Controlled Trials. From these studies, we retrieved 13 Randomized Controlled Trials and 86 review articles that were relevant to our review topics. We focused on the recent literature dealing with glucocorticoid metabolism in critically ill patients and investigating the effects of glucocorticoid therapy on the immune system in COVID-19 patients with severe lung injury.
Results
In our review, we have discussed the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with critical illness, selection of a specific GC for critical illness-related GC insufficiency, and recent studies that investigated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysfunction in patients with COVID-19. We have also addressed the specific activation of the immune system with chronic endogenous glucocorticoid excess, as seen in patients with Cushing syndrome, and, finally, we have discussed immune activation due to coronavirus infection and the possible mechanisms leading to improved outcomes in patients with COVID-19 treated with GCs.
Conclusion
For clinical endocrinologists prescribing GCs for their patients, a precise understanding of both the molecular- and cellular-level mechanisms of endogenous and exogenous GCs is imperative, including timing of administration, dosage, duration of treatment, and specific formulations of GCs.

AB  - The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic urges researching possibilities for prevention and management of the effects of the virus. Carotenoids are natural phytochemicals of anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties and may exert potential in aiding in combatting the pandemic. This review presents the direct and indirect evidence of the health benefits of carotenoids and derivatives based on in vitro and in vivo studies, human clinical trials and epidemiological studies and proposes possible mechanisms of action via which carotenoids may have the capacity to protect against COVID-19 effects. The current evidence provides a rationale for considering carotenoids as natural supportive nutrients via antioxidant activities, including scavenging lipid-soluble radicals, reducing hypoxia-associated superoxide by activating antioxidant enzymes, or suppressing enzymes that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). Carotenoids may regulate COVID-19 induced over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, pro-inflammatory enzymes and adhesion molecules by nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) and interleukins-6- Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (IL-6-JAK/STAT) pathways and suppress the polarization of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage. Moreover, carotenoids may modulate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors γ by acting as agonists to alleviate COVID-19 symptoms. They also may potentially block the cellular receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). These activities may reduce the severity of COVID-19 and flu-like diseases. Thus, carotenoid supplementation may aid in combatting the pandemic, as well as seasonal flu. However, further in vitro, in vivo and in particular long-term clinical trials in COVID-19 patients are needed to evaluate this hypothesis.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to twin public health and economic crises around the world. Not only has it cost hundreds of thousands of lives but also severely impacted livelihoods and placed enormous strain on community healthcare and welfare services. In this review, we explore the events associated with SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and host immunopathological reactivity due to the clinical manifestations of this coronavirus infection. We discuss that the metallopeptidase enzyme ADAM17, also known as tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme, TACE, is responsible for shedding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and membrane-bound interleukin (IL)-6 receptor. This leads to elevated pro-inflammatory responses that result in cytokine storm syndrome. We argue that cytokine balance may be restored by recovering an IL-6 trans-signaling neutralizing buffer system through the mediation of recombinant soluble glycoprotein 130 and recombinant ADAM17/TACE prodomain inhibitor. This cytokine restoration, possibly combined with inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry as well as replication and coagulopathy, could be introduced as a novel approach to treat patients with severe COVID-19. In cases of co-morbidity, therapies related to the management of associated disease conditions could ameliorate those clinical manifestations.

In this review article, we discuss the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and its dual purpose in general and transplant hepatology. As the landscape of liver disease and transplantation has evolved considerably since the advent of the MELD score, we summarise emerging concepts, methodologies, and technologies that may improve mortality prognostication in the future. Finally, we explore how these novel concepts and technologies may be incorporated into clinical practice.

AB  - Summary
Several global efforts are underway to develop COVID-19 vaccines, and interim analyses from phase 3 clinical testing have been announced by nine organisations: Pfizer, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm Group, Sinovac Biotech, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, and CanSino Biologics. The US programme known as Operation Warp Speed provided US$18 billion in funding for development of vaccines that were intended for US populations. Depending on safety and efficacy, vaccines can become available through mechanisms for emergency use, expanded access with informed consent, or full licensure. An important question is: how will these Operation Warp Speed vaccines be used for COVID-19 prevention in global health settings? We address some key questions that arise in the transition from US to global vaccine prevention efforts and from ethical and logistical issues to those that are relevant to global vaccine security, justice, equity, and diplomacy.

AB  - Introduction
A novel coronavirus virus (2019-nCoV) emerged in China in December 2019 and achieved a high-risk category by the World Health Organization (WHO). The initial symptoms included fever, cough, dyspnea, and sore throat. The present review aims to evaluate the available evidence for the safety and efficacy of Unani herbal drugs and formulations in the prevention of Wabai Amraz (epidemic diseases) having resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
Sources of data for this paper are classical Unani textbooks, Unani pharmacopeia of India, Indian Medicinal Plants-An Illustrated Dictionary, and published articles in various reputed peer-reviewed journals. Collected information was then critically analyzed.
Results
Despite great efforts, no specific treatment has been discovered for coronavirus yet. The best choices, therefore, are prevention and management. The Unani system of medicine offers health protection during epidemics. Three important interventions practised during an outbreak are (i) purification of the environment by using certain herbal drugs as fumigants which include vinegar (acetic acid) alone or combined with Ferula foetida Regel; (ii) promotion of health and immune modulation by using the pharmacopoeial preparations Khamira-e-Khashkhash and Khamira-e-Marwareed.
Conclusion
Several single drugs, as well as compound formulations, have been recommended in Unani medicine for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. The pharmacopoeial preparation Tiryaq-e-Nazla has been used for respiratory catarrhal inflammations and influenza by Hakims of the medieval period. Scientific research on these drugs reveals the presence of many pharmacologically active substances possessing significant antiviral, antipyretic, anti-tussive, and immune-modulatory properties, which can give new insight into infection and epidemic management.

AB  - Summary
Objectives
“Long COVID”, a term coined by COVID-19 survivors, describes persistent or new symptoms in a subset of patients who have recovered from acute illness. Globally, the population of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to expand rapidly, necessitating the need for a more thorough understanding of the array of potential sequelae of COVID-19. The multisystemic aspects of acute COVID-19 have been the subject of intense investigation, but the long–term complications remain poorly understood. Emerging data from lay press, social media, commentaries, and emerging scientific reports suggest that some COVID-19 survivors experience organ impairment and/or debilitating chronic symptoms, at times protean in nature, which impact their quality of life.
Methods/Results
In this review, by addressing separately each body system, we describe the pleiotropic manifestations reported post COVID-19, their putative pathophysiology and risk factors, and attempt to offer guidance regarding work-up, follow-up and management strategies. Long term sequelae involve all systems with a negative impact on mental health, well-being and quality of life, while a subset of patients, report debilitating chronic fatigue, with or without other fluctuating or persistent symptoms, such as pain or cognitive dysfunction. Although the pathogenesis is unclear, residual damage from acute infection, persistent immune activation, mental factors, or unmasking of underlying co-morbidities are considered as drivers. Comparing long COVID with other post viral chronic syndromes may help to contextualize the complex somatic and emotional sequalae of acute COVID-19. The pace of recovery of different aspects of the syndrome remains unclear as the pandemic began only a year ago.
Conclusions
Early recognition of long-term effects and thorough follow-up through dedicated multidisciplinary outpatient clinics with a carefully integrated research agenda are essential for treating COVID-19 survivors holistically.

AB  - Historically, there has been a debate on the effects of recessions on population health, and especially on mortality and its distribution across different social groups. This paper contributes to this discussion by means of a critical review of the research on the impact of economic recessions on mortality inequalities in the period 1980–2020. We analyzed 19 studies according to their mortality outcomes, socioeconomic indicators, design, analysis, and main findings. Twelve studies focused on European countries or urban areas, two on Asian countries, two on Russia, one on Asia and Europe, one on the USA, and one in Somalia. Five articles included cross-country comparisons (four between European countries or cities and one between Asian and European countries). The Great Recession of 2008 was the most researched economic crisis, followed by country-specific crises in the 90s, the fall of the Soviet Union, and some crises during the 80s. Most studies (n = 15) showed an overall or partial increase in mortality inequalities after an economic recession. However, two papers found a decrease in mortality inequalities due to the worsening of the health of the upper and middle classes, one article found a decrease in inequalities due to a general improvement in population health, and a study found a “slow-down” effect of pre-existent mortality inequalities.

AB  - A novel infectious disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was detected in December 2019 and declared as a global pandemic by the World Health. Approximately 15% of patients with COVID-19 progress to severe pneumonia and eventually develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock and/or multiple organ failure with high morbidity and mortality. Evidence points towards a determinant pathogenic role of members of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) in mediating the susceptibility, infection, inflammatory response and parenchymal injury in lungs and other organs of COVID-19 patients. The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has important roles in pulmonary pathological states, including fibrosis, pneumonia and ARDS. RAGE overexpression/hyperactivation is essential to the deleterious effects of RAS in several pathological processes, including hypertension, chronic kidney and cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes, all of which are major comorbidities of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We propose RAGE as an additional molecular target in COVID-19 patients for ameliorating the multi-organ pathology induced by the virus and improving survival, also in the perspective of future infections by other coronaviruses.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes COVID-19 disease, characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome, bilateral pneumonia, and organ failure. The consequences of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection for the pregnant woman, fetus, and neonate are controversial. Thus, it is required to determine whether there is viral and non-viral vertical transmission in COVID-19. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 leads to functional alterations in asymptomatic and symptomatic pregnant women, the fetoplacental unit and the neonate. Several diseases of pregnancy, including COVID-19, affect the fetoplacental function, which causes in utero programming for young and adult diseases. A generalized inflammatory state and a higher risk of infection are seen in pregnant women with COVID-19. Obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension may increase the vulnerability of pregnant women to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 show specific mutations that seem to increase the capacity of the virus to infect the pregnant woman, likely due to increasing its interaction via the virus S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors. This review shows the literature addressing to what extent COVID-19 in pregnancy affects the pregnant woman, fetoplacental unit, and neonate. Prospective studies that are key in managing SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy are discussed.

AB  - Acute and chronic respiratory illnesses cause widespread morbidity and mortality, and this class of illness now includes the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome that is causing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The world is experiencing a major demographic shift toward an older, obese, and physically inactive populace. Risk factor assessments based on pandemic data indicate that those at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 include older males, and people of all ages with obesity and related comorbidities such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Aging in and of itself leads to negative changes in innate and adaptive immunity, a process termed immunosenescence. Obesity causes systemic inflammation and adversely impacts immune function and host defense in a way that patterns immunosenescence. Two primary prevention strategies to reduce the risk for COVID-19 at both the community and individual levels include mitigation activities and the adoption of lifestyle practices consistent with good immune health. Animal and human studies support the idea that, in contrast to high exercise workloads, regular moderate-intensity physical activity improves immunosurveillance against pathogens and reduces morbidity and mortality from viral infection and respiratory illnesses including the common cold, pneumonia, and influenza. The odds are high that infectious disease pandemics spawned by novel pathogens will continue to inflict morbidity and mortality as the world's population becomes older and more obese. COVID-19 is indeed a wake-up call, a tocsin, to the world that primary prevention countermeasures focused on health behaviors and hygiene demand our full attention and support.

AB  - Background
In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the New Zealand government instituted a 4-level alert system, which resulted in the rapid dissolution of nonurgent surgical services to minimize occupational exposure to both patients and staff, with the primary health sector bearing most of the diverted caseload. Consequently, the study authors sought to collate information around the establishment of a supportive nonacute surgical liaison role in a public hospital surgical department, with an interest in establishing this role in New Zealand.
Methods
The narrative review conducted systematically in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Databases searched included Pubmed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials. A deductive analysis was applied using a demand management model developed by the Institute for Innovation and Improvement at Waitematā District Health Board. All included studies were rated using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence tool.
Results
Collation of 19 studies resulted in 3 key findings: first, that a surgical liaison could be utilized at the primary care to specialist interface to improve communication and workflow between services. Second, a liaison could be utilized directly communicating with patients as a means of increasing engagement and self-management. Finally, this service can be offered through multiple modalities including a noncontact telehealth service.
Conclusion
Evidence of nonacute surgical liaisons both internationally and specifically within New Zealand has been collated to provide evidence for its application.

AB  - The latest global pandemic corona virus disease − 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 is still a matter of worrying concern both for the scientific communities and health care organizations. COVID-19 disease is proved to be a highly contagious disease transmitted through respiratory droplets and even close contact with affected individuals. COVID-19 disease is also understood to exhibit diverse symptoms of ranging severities i.e., from mild fatigue to death. Affected individuals' susceptibility to induce immunologic dysregulation phenomena termed ‘cytokine storm’ seems to be playing the damaging role of escalating the disease manifestation from mild to severe. Cytokine storm in patients with severe symptoms is understood to be characterized by enhanced serum levels of many cytokines including interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, IP-10/CXCL10, TNF, interferon-γ, MIP-1α, MIP-1β and VEGF. Since cytokine production in general is the most important antiviral defense response, understanding the COVID-19 associated cytokine storm in particular and differentiating it from the regular cytokine production response becomes crucial in developing an effective therapeutic strategy.This review focuses on the potential targeting of COVID-19 associated cytokine storm and its challenges.

Thyroid gland was one of them due to expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the protein facilitating viral binding to the host cells. Moreover, thyroid gland, important for regulation of hormonal network, is extremely sensitive to any changes in homeostasis and metabolism. It was shown, that COVID-19 was associated with induction of thyroid disease or increasing existing functional disturbances or autoimmune process. Thyroid diseases are mainly based on immunological pathomechanism although the relation between immune system and thyroid function is bidirectional e.g. thyroid hormones modulate specific immune responses, including cell-mediated immunity, NK cell activity, the production of antiviral interferon (IFN) and proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes. The effects of COVID-19 and mRNA vaccine on thyroid function and diseases are discussed.

AB  - The main reason for the growth of mucormycosis in people with Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is mainly produced by Rhizopus spp. The infective mechanisms and issues recognized in Rhizopus spp. are the cell wall, germination proteins, and enzymes assisted to iron sequestration, CotH protein, and positive regulation of the GRP78 cell receptor. Mucormycosis is mainly caused by the Rhizopus spp. such as R. oryzae, R. microsporus, R. arrhizus, R. homothallicus, etc. that are gifted to numerous host defense mechanisms and attribute to the endothelium via specific receptors, GRP78 simplifying their endocytosis and angio-invasion. Factors such as hyperglycemia, elevated iron concentrations, and ketoacidosis have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis in the tentative situation. The analytical data of ‘black fungus disease’ or ‘mucormycosis’, specify India reported for about 42.3% of published cases, followed by the USA about 16.9%, Iraq, Bangladesh, Iran, Paraguay, and 1 case each from Brazil, Mexico, Italy, UK, China, France, Uruguay, Turkey, and Austria. The COVID-19 infection is maybe a predisposing factor for mucormycosis and is related to a high mortality rate. Early recognition and restriction of hyperglycemia, liposomal amphotericin B, and surgical debridement are the bases in the successful managing of mucormycosis.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), elicited by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is a pandemic public health emergency of global concern. Other than the profound severe pulmonary damage, SARS-CoV-2 infection also leads to a series of cardiovascular abnormalities, including myocardial injury, myocarditis and pericarditis, arrhythmia and cardiac arrest, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and coagulation abnormalities. Meanwhile, COVID-19 patients with preexisting cardiovascular diseases are often at a much higher risk of increased morbidity and mortality. Up–to-date, a number of mechanisms have been postulated for COVID-19-associated cardiovascular damage including SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activation, cytokine storm, hypoxemia, stress and cardiotoxicity of antiviral drugs. In this context, special attention should be given towards COVID-19 patients with concurrent cardiovascular diseases, and special cardiovascular attention is warranted for treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - The incidence and severity of COVID-19 infections have been disproportionately high in Native American populations. Native Americans are a high-risk group for COVID-19 because of a variety of healthcare disparities. Historically, these populations suffered excessively during previous epidemics in the United States (US). Several epidemics occurred when disease-naïve indigenous peoples were exposed to European settlers with herd immunity. Native American populations had four times higher mortality in the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic. Deaths from H1N1 infections were higher in Native Americans and most cases and deaths from the Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) occurred in Native Americans. Other infectious diseases, including HIV, hepatitis A and hepatitis C are more also common. Diabetes, alcoholism and cardiovascular diseases, all risk factors for severity and mortality in COVID-19 infection, are also more common in this group. Addressing the root causes of enhanced risk in Native American populations will improve outcomes from COVID-19 and future pandemics.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 instigated by coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has delivered an unfathomable obstruction that has touched all sectors worldwide. Despite new vaccine technologies and mass administration of booster doses, the virus persists, and unknown the ending of the pandemic for new variants and sub-variants. Moreover, whether leaning on home medications or using plant extracts is sufficient often to combat the virus has generated tremendous interest in the scientific fraternity. Different databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar used to find published articles linked with related topics. Currently, COVID-19 third and fourth shots of vaccines are progressively administered worldwide, where some countries trail others by a significant margin. Many proteins related to viral activity have changed, possibly boosting the virus infectivity and making antibodies ineffective. This study will reminisce the viral genome, associated pathways for viral protein functions, variants, and their mutations. The current, comprehensive review will also provide information on vaccine technologies developed by several biotech companies and the efficacy of their doses, costs including boosters on a mass level. As no vaccine is working to protect fully against all the variants, the new proactive vaccine research needs to be conducted based on all variants, their sub-lineage, and mutations.

AB  - Contrary to the long-held belief that the effects of vaccines are specific for the disease they were created; compelling evidence has demonstrated that vaccines can exert positive or deleterious non-specific effects (NSEs). In this review, we compiled research reports from the last 40 years, which were found based on the PubMed search for the epidemiological and immunological studies on the non-specific effects (NSEs) of the most common human vaccines. Analysis of information showed that live vaccines induce positive NSEs, whereas non-live vaccines induce several negative NSEs, including increased female mortality associated with enhanced susceptibility to other infectious diseases, especially in developing countries. These negative NSEs are determined by the vaccination sequence, the antigen concentration in vaccines, the type of vaccine used (live vs. non-live), and also by repeated vaccination. We do not recommend stopping using non-live vaccines, as they have demonstrated to protect against their target disease, so the suggestion is that their detrimental NSEs can be minimized simply by changing the current vaccination sequence. High IgG4 antibody levels generated in response to repeated inoculation with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could be associated with a higher mortality rate from unrelated diseases and infections by suppressing the immune system. Since most COVID-19 vaccinated countries are reporting high percentages of excess mortality not directly attributable to deaths from such disease, the NSEs of mRNA vaccines on overall mortality should be studied in depth.

AB  - During severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, activated macrophages, dendritic cells (D.C.), neutrophils, and natural killer (N.K.) cells are the first defense against infection. These immune effectors trap and ingest the virus, kill infected epithelial cells, or produce anti-viral cytokines. Evidence suggests that aging, obesity, and mental illness can lead to weakened innate immunity and, thus, are all associated with elevated infection and severe disease progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Innate immune defense networks play a fundamental role in suppressing viral replication, infection establishment, and viral pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses.

AB  - Cytokine storms and extra-activated cytokine signaling pathways can lead to severe tissue damage and patient death. Activation of inflammatory signaling pathways during Cytokine storms are an important factor in the development of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), which is the major health problem today, causing systemic and local inflammation. Cytokine storms attract many inflammatory cells that attack the lungs and other organs and cause tissue damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are expressed in a different type of tissues. inhibition of ACE2 activity impairs renin-angiotensin (RAS) function, which is related to the severity of symptoms and mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. Different signaling cascades are activated, affecting various organs during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nowadays, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19, but scientists have recognized and proposed several treatment alternatives, including applying cytokine inhibitors, immunomodulators, and plasma therapy. Herein, we have provided the detailed mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine signaling and its connection with pathophysiological features in different organs. Possible treatment options to cope with the severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are also discussed.

AB  - Health disparity related to race/ethnicity has been cited as “the most serious and shameful health care issue of our time”(Peterson et al., 2018). A portion of the now recognized disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) communities is attributable to social determinants such as socioeconomic status (SES), physical living situation, health care access, and the psychosocial factors associated with socioenvironmental circumstances such as bias, victimization, trauma and toxic stress as well as structural factors that reduce the capacity to practice physical distancing (Agurs-Collins et al., 2019). In this paper, we hypothesize that, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, disproportionate socio-economic and environmental stressors in the BIPOC population promoted heightened stress-associated neurobiological activity (Stress-NbA). This chronic elevation in Stress-NbA results in down-stream complications of chronic stress including underactivation of anti-viral type I IFN pathway genes. This results in an increase in susceptibility to viral diseases, including coronavirus illnesses. Additionally, Stress-NbA chronically potentiates systemic inflammation (from hematopoietic system activation with myelopoiesis) increasing the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and setting the stage for stress-related chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This process was propelled by overactivation of immune cell gene expression in the nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) activation pathway and underactivation of gene expression in the anti-viral type I interferon (IFN) pathway. The higher prevalence of MetS and NCDs in minority populations turned out to be predictive of the elevated risk they would face in the presence of a highly contagious viral pandemic. The stress-related generation of a chronic non-pathogen associated molecular pattern (non-PAMP) immunoactivation state led to decreased viral immune defense and increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection with increased risk of severe illness induced by cytokine storm syndrome (CSS).

AB  - Summary
Measles vaccine (MV) has been observed to reduce all-cause mortality more than explained by prevention of measles infection. Recently, prevention of “measles-induced immune amnesia” (MIA) has been proposed as an explanation for this larger-than-anticipated beneficial effect of measles vaccine (MV). According to the “MIA hypothesis”, immune amnesia leads to excess non-measles morbidity and mortality, that may last up to five years after measles infection, but may be prevented by MV. However, the benefits of MV-vaccinated children could also be due to beneficial non-specific effects (NSEs) of MV, reducing the risk of non-measles infections (The “NSE hypothesis"). The epidemiological studies do provide some support for MIA, as exposure to measles infection before 6 months of age causes long-term MIA, and over 6 months of age for 2–3 months. However, in children over 6 months of age, the MIA hypothesis is contradicted by several epidemiological patterns: First, in community studies that adjusted for MV status, children surviving acute measles infection had lower mortality than uninfected controls (44%(95%CI: 0–69%)). Second, in six randomised trials and six observational studies comparing MV-vaccinated and MV-unvaccinated children, the benefit of MV changed minimally from 54%(43–63%) to 49%(37–59%) when measles cases were censored in the survival analysis, making it unlikely that prevention of measles and its long-term consequences explained much of the reduced mortality. Third, several studies conducted in measles-free contexts still showed significantly lower mortality after MV (55%(40–67%)). Fourth, administration of MV in the presence of maternal measles antibody (MatAb) is associated with much stronger beneficial effect for child survival than administration of MV in the absence of MatAb (55%(35–68%) lower mortality). The MIA hypothesis alone cannot explain the strongly beneficial effects of MV on child survival. Conversely, the hypothesis that MV has beneficial non-specific immune training effects is compatible with all available data. Consideration should be given to continuing MV even when measles has been eradicated.

AB  - Summary
Immunocompromised individuals and particularly those with hematologic malignancies are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity and mortality due to immunologic deficits that limit prevention, treatment, and clearance of the virus. Understanding the natural history of viral infections in people with impaired immunity due to underlying conditions, immunosuppressive therapy, or a combination thereof has emerged as a critical area of investigation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies focused on these individuals have provided key insights into aspects of innate and adaptive immunity underlying both the antiviral immune response and excess inflammation in the setting of COVID-19. This review presents what is known about distinct states of immunologic vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 and how this information can be harnessed to improve prevention and treatment strategies for immunologically high-risk populations.

AB  - A heightened risk of thrombosis noted early on with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection led to the widespread use of heparin anticoagulation in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. However, reports soon started appearing in the literature where an apparent failure of heparin to prevent thrombotic events was observed in hospitalized patients with this viral infection. In this review, we explore the likely mechanisms for heparin failure with particular relevance to COVID‐19. We also explore the role of anti‐Xa assays and global hemostatic tests in this context. The current controversy of dosing heparin in this disease is detailed with some possible mechanistic reasons for anticoagulant failure. We hope that lessons learnt from the use of heparin in COVID‐19 could assist us in the appropriate use of this anticoagulant in the future.
