AB  - Advances in neonatal medicine have progressively increased the survival of premature infants. Increased survival has however come at the cost of increased number of infants with prematurity-related complications. This is represented by high rates of respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), sepsis, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), cerebral palsy, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) and visual and hearing problems in survivors. In addition to prolonged hospital stay after birth, readmission to hospital in the first year of life is common if chronic lung disease exists. Around 3% of newborns have a congenital physical anomaly with 60% of congenital anomalies affecting the brain or heart and around 1% having multiple anomalies. Individual congenital conditions requiring surgical intervention in the neonatal period are rare. Neonates have a higher perioperative mortality risk largely due to the degree of prior illness, the complexity of their surgeries, and infant physiology. The maintenance of oxygenation and perfusion in the perioperative phase is critical as both affect cerebral perfusion and neurocognitive outcome but the triggers for intervention and the thresholds of physiological parameters during neonatal anaesthesia are not well described. After even minor surgical procedures, ex-premature infants are at higher risk for postoperative complications than infants born at term.

AB  - Introduction
Despite respiratory disease being a major cause of excess mortality in people with schizophrenia, the prevalence of respiratory conditions in this population is poorly defined. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to establish the prevalence and association of respiratory diseases in people with schizophrenia.
Material and methods
Major electronic databases were searched from inception to 27 April 2020 for articles reporting respiratory disease (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], pneumonia, and tuberculosis) in people with schizophrenia and, where possible, a control group. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018115137).
Results
Of 1569 citations, 21 studies consisting of 619,214 individuals with schizophrenia and 52,159,551 controls were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to the general population, people with schizophrenia had significantly higher rates of COPD (odds ratio [OR]: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.28–2.57), asthma (OR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.02–2.83), and pneumonia (OR: 2.62, 95% CI: 1.10–6.23). In people with schizophrenia, the prevalence of COPD was 7.7% (95% CI: 4.0–14.4), asthma 7.5% (95% CI: 4.9–11.3), pneumonia 10.3% (95% CI 5.4–18.6), and tuberculosis 0.3% (95% CI 0.1 –0.8). After adjusting for publication bias, the prevalence of COPD increased to 19.9% (95% CI: 9.6–36.7).
Discussion
All respiratory diseases examined were significantly more prevalent in people with schizophrenia compared with the general population. Future studies should focus on improving the prevention and management of respiratory disease in this group to reduce associated excess mortality.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic was officially declared on March 11th, 2020. Since the very beginning, the spread of the virus has been tracked nearly in real-time by worldwide genome sequencing efforts. As of March 2021, more than 830,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been uploaded in GISAID and this wealth of data allowed researchers to study the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during this first pandemic year. In parallel, nomenclatures systems, often with poor consistency among each other, have been developed to designate emerging viral lineages. Despite general fears that the virus might mutate to become more virulent or transmissible, SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity has remained relatively low during the first ~ 8 months of sustained human-to-human transmission. At the end of 2020/beginning of 2021, though, some alarming events started to raise concerns of possible changes in the evolutionary trajectory of the virus. Specifically, three new viral variants associated with extensive transmission have been described as variants of concern (VOC). These variants were first reported in the UK (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1). Their designation as VOCs was determined by an increase of local cases and by the high number of amino acid substitutions harboured by these lineages. This latter feature is reminiscent of viral sequences isolated from immunocompromised patients with long-term infection, suggesting a possible causal link. Here we review the events that led to the identification of these lineages, as well as emerging data concerning their possible implications for viral phenotypes, reinfection risk, vaccine efficiency and epidemic potential. Most of the available evidence is, to date, provisional, but still represents a starting point to uncover the potential threat posed by the VOCs. We also stress that genomic surveillance must be strengthened, especially in the wake of the vaccination campaigns.

AB  - The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) is one of the most complex hormonal regulatory systems, involving several organs that interact to regulate multiple body functions. The study of this system initially focused on investigating its role in the regulation of both cardiovascular function and related pathologies. From this approach, pharmacological strategies were developed for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, new findings in recent decades have suggested that the RAS is much more complex and comprises two subsystems, the classic RAS and an alternative RAS, with antagonistic effects that are usually in equilibrium. The classic system is involved in pathologies where inflammatory, hypertrophic and fibrotic phenomena are common and is related to the development of chronic diseases that affect various body systems. This understanding has been reinforced by the evidence that local renin–angiotensin systems exist in many tissue types and by the role of the RAS in the spread and severity of COVID-19 infection, where it was discovered that viral entry into cells of the respiratory system is accomplished through binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is present in the alveolar epithelium and is overexpressed in patients with chronic cardiometabolic diseases. In this narrative review, preclinical and clinical aspects of the RAS are presented and topics for future research are discussed some aspects are raised that should be clarified in the future and that call for further investigation of this system.

AB  - The innate immune system initiates cell death pathways in response to pathogens and cellular stress. Cell death can be either non-lytic (apoptosis) or lytic (PANoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis). PANoptosis has been identified as an inflammatory, lytic cell death pathway driven by caspases and RIPKs that is regulated by PANoptosome complexes, making it distinct from other cell death pathways. Several PANoptosome complexes (including ZBP1-, AIM2-, RIPK1-, and NLRP12-PANoptosomes) have been characterized to date. Furthermore, PANoptosis is implicated in infectious and inflammatory diseases, cancers, and homeostatic perturbations. Therefore, targeting its molecular components offers significant potential for therapeutic development. This review covers PANoptosomes and their assembly, PANoptosome-mediated cell death mechanisms, and ongoing progress in developing therapeutics that target PANoptosis.

AB  - Summary
Migrant populations are one of several underimmunised groups in the EU or European Economic Area (EU/EEA), yet little is known about their involvement in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. This information is vital to develop targeted strategies to improve the health of diverse migrant communities. We did a systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42019157473; Jan 1, 2000, to May 22, 2020) adhering to PRISMA guidelines, to identify studies on vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks (measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, hepatitis A, varicella, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae) involving migrants residing in the EU/EEA and Switzerland. We identified 45 studies, reporting on 47 distinct vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks across 13 countries. Most reported outbreaks involving migrants were of measles (n=24; 6496 cases), followed by varicella (n=11; 505 cases), hepatitis A (n=7; 1356 cases), rubella (n=3; 487 cases), and mumps (n=2; 293 cases). 19 (40%) outbreaks, predominantly varicella and measles, were reported in temporary refugee camps or shelters. Of 11 varicella outbreaks, nine (82%) were associated with adult migrants. Half of measles outbreaks (n=11) were associated with migrants from eastern European countries. In conclusion, migrants are involved in vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks in Europe, with adult and child refugees residing in shelters or temporary camps at particular risk, alongside specific nationality groups. Vulnerability varies by disease, setting, and demographics, highlighting the importance of tailoring catch-up vaccination interventions to specific groups in order to meet regional and global vaccination targets as recommended by the new Immunisation Agenda 2030 framework for action. A better understanding of vaccine access and intent in migrant groups and a greater focus on co-designing interventions is urgently needed, with direct implications for COVID-19 vaccine delivery.

AB  - The menace of antibiotic resistance is on the rise, and one critical reason for that is the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Detection, severity assessment, and differentiation of bacterial infection from other causes of similar symptoms remain the key to guide antibiotic therapy. Unlike other acute phase reactants, procalcitonin (PCT) has evolved as a promising biomarker that can help distinguish between bacterial infections and other infections caused by virus, fungus or any other inflammatory condition. In the normal physiological state, it is produced mainly from parafollicular C cells of the thyroid gland and in minute quantities from the neuroendocrine cells of the lungs and the intestine and gets converted to calcitonin, the calcium regulating hormone. It is produced from extra thyroid tissues during bacterial infections, mediated by interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). PCT is an excellent biomarker for sepsis detection in an institutional setting and has been included in many diagnostic algorithms and scoring systems. Apart from that, it is used for the monitoring of response and discontinuation time of antimicrobial agents. Recent evidence supports the use of procalcitonin estimation in primary care settings and monitoring of COVID-19 cases also. A low cost, rapid, quantitative point of care sensor with desired sensitivity is needed for that to be possible. Several sensitive optical and electrochemical biosensors have been designed to quantify serum PCT. Some have been translated to laboratory settings, but not much progress has happened in terms of rapid point-of-care detection, which is essential considering the clinical relevance. In this article, the progress in the last decade has been reviewed, both in terms of clinical evidence and the sensor development for procalcitonin. Discussion regarding possible advancements has also been carried out.

Background
Early childhood is a vital period for development and growth. Promoting beneficial lifestyle behaviours in early childhood can help optimise children's health, development and learning, shape their behaviours in adulthood and offer the best protection against future non-communicable diseases (NCDs). In the Asia–Pacific region, NCDs are significant causes of healthcare burden and mortality. Furthermore, there is also a high prevalence of adverse metabolic risk factors and unhealthy lifestyle behaviours among these children.
Method
Representatives from 19 Asia–Pacific nations and/or jurisdictions developed a consensus statement on integrated 24-hour activity guidelines for the early years using the GRADE-ADOLOPMENT framework.
Findings
These guidelines apply to all infants, toddlers and pre-schoolers below 5 years of age. The guidelines aim to provide a holistic and practical approach to lifestyle activities by framing physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep within a 24-hour period. Dietary patterns were included as they play an integral role in metabolic health and energy balance.
Interpretation
Aligned with the World Health Organization's Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs through health promotion interventions in early life, through cultivating healthy lifestyle behaviours in the children's early years, we aim to provide children with the best start in life and reduce the burden of future NCDs in the Asia–Pacific region.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the most rapidly increasing form of HF, occurs primarily in older women, and is associated with high rates of morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures. In the highest age decile (≥90 years old), nearly all patients with HFpEF. As our understanding of the disease has grown in the last few years, we now know that HFpEF is a systemic disorder influenced by aging processes. The involvement of this broad collection of abnormalities in HFpEF, the recognition of the high frequency and impact of noncardiac comorbidities, and systemic, multiorgan involvement, and its nearly exclusive existence in older persons, has led to the recognition of HFpEF as a true geriatric syndrome. Most of the conventional therapeutics used in other cardiac diseases have failed to improve HFpEF patient outcomes significantly. Several recent studies have evaluated exercise training (ET) as a therapeutic management strategy in patients with HFpEF. Although these studies were not designed to address clinical endpoints, such as HF hospitalizations and mortality, they have shown that ET is a safe and effective intervention to improve peak oxygen consumption, physical function, and quality of life in clinically stable HF patients. Recently, a progressive, multidomain physical rehabilitation study among older adults showed that it is feasible in older patients with acute decompensated HF who have high frailty and comorbidities and showed improvement in physical function. However, the lack of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services coverage can be a major barrier to formal cardiac rehabilitation in older HFpEF patients. Unfortunately, insistence upon demonstration of mortality improvement before approving reimbursement overlooks the valuable and demonstrated benefits of physical function and life quality.

AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are two major atmospheric pollutants that significantly threaten human health, the environment, and ecosystems worldwide. Despite this, only some studies have investigated the spatiotemporal hotspots of NO2 and SO2, their trends, production, and sources in Asia. Our study presents a literature review covering the production, trends, and sources of NO2 and SO2 across Asian countries (e.g., Bangladesh, China, India, Iran, Japan, Pakistan, Malaysia, Kuwait, and Nepal). Based on the findings of the review, NO2 and SO2 pollution are increasing due to industrial activity, fossil fuel burning, biomass burning, heavy traffic movement, electricity generation, and power plants. There is significant concern about health risks associated with NO2 and SO2 emissions in Bangladesh, China, India, Malaysia, and Iran, as they pay less attention to managing and controlling pollution. Even though the lack of quality datasets and adequate research in most Asian countries further complicates the management and control of NO2 and SO2 pollution. This study has NO2 and SO2 pollution scenarios, including hotspots, trends, sources, and their influences on Asian countries. This study highlights the existing research gaps and recommends new research on identifying integrated sources, their variations, spatiotemporal trends, emission characteristics, and pollution level. Finally, the present study suggests a framework for controlling and monitoring these two pollutants' emissions.

In this meta-analysis, we aimed to compare short- versus prolonged-course antibiotic regimens for VAP.
Methods
We searched several databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness of a short- versus long-course of antibiotic treatment in patients with VAP. Data analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4.
Results
Our pooled analysis consisted of six RCTs. For 28-day mortality, no significant difference was found between the prolonged course and the short course. Administration of a short course of antibiotics increased the risk of recurrence of pneumonia in patients with VAP due to NF-GNB (RR 1.73; 95% CI: 1.17–2.54). Secondary outcomes, such as clinical resolution, duration of ICU stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation, revealed no significant difference between the two regimens. The quality of evidence was low for most outcomes.
Conclusions
Low-quality evidence suggests that a short course of antibiotics is associated with a higher recurrence of pneumonia in NF-GNB VAP with no difference in mortality as compared to a prolonged course. For definitive conclusions, large-scale and blinded RCTs are required.

AB  - Hypertension is the leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality globally. In the United States, the prevalence of hypertension (blood pressure ≥130/80 mm Hg) among adults is approximately 45%. Racial/ethnic disparities in hypertension prevalence are well documented, especially among Black adults who are disproportionately affected and have one of the highest rates of hypertension globally. Hypertension control remains a persistent public health crisis. Recently published data indicate suboptimal hypertension control rates, particularly for racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States. This requires urgent action because of the significant health care burden from cardiovascular- and stroke–related morbidity and mortality. This clinical review delineates racial/ethnic disparities in the epidemiology of hypertension, and the impact of social determinants of health on the quality of cardiovascular care and outcomes. Clinical practice guideline recommendations and various national programs targeted toward hypertension control and proposed solutions to eliminate these disparities are discussed.

AB  - Bacteria, viruses, and parasites are harmful microorganisms that cause infectious diseases. Early detection of diseases is critical to prevent disease transmission and provide epidemic preparedness, as these can cause widespread deaths and public health crises, particularly in resource-limited countries. Lateral flow assay (LFA) systems are simple-to-use, disposable, inexpensive diagnostic devices to test biomarkers in blood and urine samples. Thus, LFA has recently received significant attention, especially during the pandemic. Here, first of all, the design principles and working mechanisms of existing LFA methods are examined. Then, current LFA implementation strategies are presented for communicable disease diagnoses, including COVID-19, zika and dengue, HIV, hepatitis, influenza, malaria, and other pathogens. Furthermore, this review focuses on an overview of current problems and accessible solutions in detecting infectious agents and diseases by LFA, focusing on increasing sensitivity with various detection methods. In addition, future trends in LFA-based diagnostics are envisioned.

AB  - Mutations in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occur spontaneously during replication. Thousands of mutations have accumulated and continue to since the emergence of the virus. As novel mutations continue appearing at the scene, naturally, new variants are increasingly observed. Since the first occurrence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, a wide variety of drug compounds affecting the binding sites of the virus have begun to be studied. As the drug and vaccine trials are continuing, it is of utmost importance to take into consideration the SARS-CoV-2 mutations and their respective frequencies since these data could lead the way to multi-drug combinations. The lack of effective therapeutic and preventive strategies against human coronaviruses (hCoVs) necessitates research that is of interest to the clinical applications. The reason why the mutations in glycoprotein S lead to vaccine escape is related to the location of the mutation and the affinity of the protein. At the same time, it can be said that variations should occur in areas such as the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and vaccines and antiviral drugs should be formulated by targeting more than one viral protein. In this review, a literature survey in the scope of the increasing SARS-CoV-2 mutations and the viral variations is conducted. In the light of current knowledge, the various disguises of the mutant SARS-CoV-2 forms and their apparent differences from the original strain are examined as they could possibly aid in finding the most appropriate therapeutic approaches.

Sex disparities in cancer exist along the cancer spectrum, ranging from genomic predisposition and behavioral risk factors to access to screening, diagnostics, treatment, and survivorship care. A growing body of research is studying the biological underpinnings of these differences, from cancer risk to tumor biology to treatment response. It is well known, however, that the social determinants of health play a large role across the cancer disease continuum, which encompasses risk, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, rehabilitation, and palliative care. Less literature focuses on the gendered disparities that are epidemiologic in nature, especially in Southeast Asia (SEA), a diverse region that is home to nearly 670 million people, where most are lower middle income countries, and where socioeconomic and cultural factors increase cancer risk for women. In this review, we highlight the social drivers of gendered disparities, namely the geographic, environmental, sociocultural, economic, and political forces that contribute to the increased mortality and poorer health outcomes in the region.

AB  - In recent years, the clinician has a more diverse approach to immunosuppression. Now, for many conditions, such as solid organ transplantation or treatment of some autoimmune diseases, the consequences of immunosuppression becomes a greater risk than organ failure from immune-mediated disease. Some of the consequences of immunosuppression can be prevented by prophylaxis, immunisation, surveillance and pharmacological intervention. Infections and malignancy are major causes of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed. Screening for evidence of latent infection and immunisation prior to introduction of immunosuppression (where possible and appropriate) will help reduce the risk of infection. Surveillance for those cancers that are increased in association with immunosuppression (especially skin cancers, melanoma, anal canal, Kaposi, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease) will allow early detection and intervention and, where appropriate, alteration of agent.

AB  - Heterocyclic compounds have gained a lot of attention because of their numerous significant medical and biological uses. Research interest on heterocyclic compounds is rapidly increasing due to the extensive synthetic study and functional utility. They are found in more than 90% of novel drugs, and span the gap between biology and chemistry, where so much scientific discovery and application occurs. Heterocycles also play a role in different fields, inclusive of medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, and others. Pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and veterinary items are the main applications of heterocyclic compounds. In our review, we cover the majority of bio-active heterocycles that have recently been synthesized and introduced a new phase of possible antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, anticonvulsant, anthelmintics, anthelmintic antipyretics, anti-allergic, anti-histamine, herbicidal, anticancer, antihypertensive and anti-leprosy therapeutics.

AB  - Abdominal obesity may be defined as excess deposits of fat in the abdominal region. It is a common health condition seen in South Asians and is positively related to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). It is independent of body mass index and measured by raised waist circumference for men≥90 cm and women≥80 cm. The reason for its prevalence being common in Indians finds its root from pregnancy, during fetal period and has emerged as a concept of ‘Thin Fat Indian’. Malnutrition in such a critical period of growth has consequences in the form of reduced basal metabolic rate (BMR), reduced blood flow to growing tissues, reduced functional ability of vital organs, endocrine changes and reduced capacity of primary adipose tissue. However, excess of visceral fat facilitates high dosage of adipokines in the portal vein to liver and other body tissues having serious implications seen in the form NCDs like diabetes, hypertension, heart diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, kidney disorders, cancer and other health problems. Abdominal obesity should be addressed before it has progressed further to defined health issues by exercise and diet, so that people can live a quality life.

AB  - Summary
13 years after the first Lancet Series on maternal and child undernutrition, we reviewed the progress achieved on the basis of global estimates and new analyses of 50 low-income and middle-income countries with national surveys from around 2000 and 2015. The prevalence of childhood stunting has fallen, and linear growth faltering in early life has become less pronounced over time, markedly in middle-income countries but less so in low-income countries. Stunting and wasting remain public health problems in low-income countries, where 4·7% of children are simultaneously affected by both, a condition associated with a 4·8-times increase in mortality. New evidence shows that stunting and wasting might already be present at birth, and that the incidence of both conditions peaks in the first 6 months of life. Global low birthweight prevalence declined slowly at about 1·0% a year. Knowledge has accumulated on the short-term and long-term consequences of child undernutrition and on its adverse effect on adult human capital. Existing data on vitamin A deficiency among children suggest persisting high prevalence in Africa and south Asia. Zinc deficiency affects close to half of all children in the few countries with data. New evidence on the causes of poor growth points towards subclinical inflammation and environmental enteric dysfunction. Among women of reproductive age, the prevalence of low body-mass index has been reduced by half in middle-income countries, but trends in short stature prevalence are less evident. Both conditions are associated with poor outcomes for mothers and their children, whereas data on gestational weight gain are scarce. Data on the micronutrient status of women are conspicuously scarce, which constitutes an unacceptable data gap. Prevalence of anaemia in women remains high and unabated in many countries. Social inequalities are evident for many forms of undernutrition in women and children, suggesting a key role for poverty and low education, and reinforcing the need for multisectoral actions to accelerate progress. Despite little progress in some areas, maternal and child undernutrition remains a major global health concern, particularly as improvements since 2000 might be offset by the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Albumin, the most abundant circulating protein in blood, is an essential protein which binds and transports various drugs and substances, maintains the oncotic pressure of blood and influences the physiological function of the circulatory system. Albumin also has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antithrombotic properties. Evidence supports albumin's role as a strong predictor of cardiovascular (CV) risk in several patient groups. Its protective role extends to those with coronary artery disease, heart failure, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, peripheral artery disease or ischemic stroke, as well as those undergoing revascularization procedures or with aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and patients with congenital heart disease and/or endocarditis. Hypoalbuminemia is a strong prognosticator of increased all-cause and CV mortality according to several cohort studies and meta-analyses in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with or without comorbidities. Normalization of albumin levels before discharge lowers mortality risk, compared with hypoalbuminemia before discharge. Modified forms of albumin, such as ischemia modified albumin, also has prognostic value in patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease. When albumin is combined with other risk factors, such as uric acid or C-reactive protein, the prognostic value is enhanced. Although albumin supplementation may be a plausible approach, its efficacy has not been established and in patients with hypoalbuminemia, priority is focused on diagnosing and managing the underlying condition. The CV effects of hypoalbuminemia and relevant issues are considered in this review. Large cohort studies and meta-analyses are tabulated and the physiologic effects of albumin and the deleterious effects of low albumin are pictorially illustrated.

AB  - The region of Campania, South Italy rose to prominence in the mid-2000s due to the illegal disposal of waste by the Camorra during the local waste management crisis. Several lines of evidence have identified a link between exposure to toxic waste and adverse health outcomes in the local populations. Critically, studies since 2017 have strongly suggested that this link is causal in nature. The uncertainty of evidence polarised the Italian epidemiological community and partly undermined the precautionary principle in public health policy, leading to years of delay in the deployment of appropriate interventions. The crisis also sparked concerns about pollution of soil, water, and agricultural products. The contrast between political responses and protests from local communities shows analogies with environmental emergencies of a larger scale. Beyond law enforcement actions to prosecute illegal waste disposal activity, future mitigation of risks for affected populations will require coordinated efforts in environmental policy (land reclamation, improved waste management) and public health (i.e. extensive epidemiological surveillance, screening and prevention programs). By summarising evidence over the last two decades, this review aims to construct a cohesive interdisciplinary narrative of the events in the Campanian waste crisis.

AB  - Progress in improving cardiogenic shock (CS) outcomes may have been limited by failure to embrace the heterogeneity of pathophysiologic processes driving the underlying syndrome. To better understand the variability inherent to CS populations, recent algorithms for describing underlying CS disease subphenotypes have been described and validated. These strategies hope to identify specific patient subgroups with more favorable responses to standard therapies, as well as those who require novel treatment approaches. This paper is part 2 of a 2-part state-of-the-art review. In this second article, we present machine learning-based statistical approaches to identifying subphenotypes and discuss their strengths and limitations, as well as evidence from other critical illness syndromes and emerging applications in CS. We then discuss how staging and stratification may be considered in CS clinical trials and finally consider future directions for this emerging area of research.

Despite the long-term use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, the infection is often difficult to manage. The latest diagnostic modalities for IE are discussed in this study. Blood culture use in pathogen identification can lead to loss of precious time as well as generation of false negative reports. The first steps in diagnosis are blood cultures and echocardiography, but molecular techniques can be extremely useful and may be used for an accurate and early diagnosis.

AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor therapy is well suited for initiation during the heart failure hospitalization, owing to clinical benefits that accrue rapidly within days to weeks, a strong safety and tolerability profile, minimal to no effects on blood pressure, and no excess risk of adverse kidney events. There is no evidence to suggest that deferring initiation to the outpatient setting accomplishes anything beneficial. Instead, there is compelling evidence that deferring in-hospital initiation exposes patients to excess risk of early postdischarge clinical worsening and death. Lessons from other heart failure with reduced ejection fraction therapies highlight that deferring initiation of guideline-recommended medications to the U.S. outpatient setting carries a >75% chance they will not be initiated within the next year. Recognizing that 1 in 4 patients hospitalized for worsening heart failure die or are readmitted within 30 days, clinicians should embrace the in-hospital period as an optimal time to initiate sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor therapy and treat this population with the urgency it deserves.

AB  - Although stool-based organized colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs increase screening rates and reduce CRC mortality, there remain barriers to adoption and challenges to successful implementation. Health policies, incentives, and data fragmentation influence the adoption of organized screening programs. Organized outreach programs can uniformly deliver fecal immunochemical tests to nearly all health system members who are due and eligible, but the next level of organized intervention will be to leverage disaggregated data to identify individual members and subgroups that could benefit from additional or tailored services. There is an urgent need for policies to drive more widespread implementation of organized CRC screening programs and for continued innovation in health services delivery so that organized screening programs, when implemented, can achieve their full potential.

AB  - Summary: Despite immense global effort, the maternal mortality rate in low-resource settings remains unacceptably high. Globally, this reflects the grave inequalities in access to health and reproductive services. Pregnancy-associated acute kidney injury (PRAKI) is an independent risk factor for mortality. The reported incidence of PRAKI in low- and middle-income countries is higher than that of high-income countries (4%-26% versus 1%-2.8%, respectively). Hypertensive disorders are now the leading cause of PRAKI in many regions, followed by hemorrhage and sepsis. PRAKI in low-resource settings carries a high mortality for both mother and child. Outcome studies suggest that PRAKI is associated with residual kidney dysfunction and may lead to dialysis dependence. This can be a death sentence in many regions with limited kidney replacement therapy. This review will summarize data on PRAKI on the African, Latin American, and Asian continents over the past decade. It will include the progress in published data, mortality, and treatment interventions and provide recommendations for the next decade.

AB  - RNA viruses always have been a serious concern for human health by causing several outbreaks, often pandemics. The excessive mortality and deaths associated with the outbreaks caused by these viruses were due to the excessive induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to cytokine storm. Cytokines are important for cell-to-cell communication to maintain cell homeostasis. Disturbances of this homeostasis can lead to intricate chain reactions resulting in a massive release of cytokines. This could lead to a severe self-reinforcement of several feedback processes, which could eventually cause systemic harm, multiple organ failure, or death. Multiple inflammation-associated pathways were involved in the cytokine production and its regulation. Different RNA viruses induce these pathways through the interplay with their viral factors and host proteins and miRNAs regulating these pathways. This review will discuss the interplay of host proteins and miRNAs that can play an important role in the regulation of cytokine storm and the possible therapeutic potential of these molecules for the treatment and the challenges associated with the clinical translation.

AB  - Despite remarkable advances in drug therapy for heart failure (HF), the residual HF-related morbidity, mortality, and hospitalizations remain substantial across all HF phenotypes, and significant proportions of patients with HF remain symptomatic despite optimal drug therapy. Driven by these unmet clinical needs, the exponential growth of transcatheter interventions, and a recent shift in the regulatory landscape of device-based therapies, novel device-based interventions have emerged as a potential therapy for various phenotypes of HF. Device-based interventions can overcome some of the limitations of drug therapy (eg, intolerance, nonadherence, inconsistent delivery, and recurrent and long-term cost) and can target some HF-related pathophysiologic pathways more effectively than drug therapy. This paper reviews the current evolving landscape of device-based interventions in HF and highlights critical points related to implementation of these therapies in the current workflow of HF management.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the ability of people globally to consistently engage in their typical physical activity and exercise behaviour, contributing to the rising number of people living with overweight and obesity. The imposed government lockdowns and quarantine periods saw an increase in social media influencers delivering their own home-based exercise programmes, but these are unlikely to be an evidence-based, efficacious, long-term solution to tackle sedentary behaviour and increase physical activity. This rapid review aims to conceptualise home-based exercise and physical activity programmes, by extracting relevant programme characteristics regarding the availability of evidence and effectiveness of home-based exercise programmes. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria, of which there were varied reports of significant positive effects of the exercise programme on weight management and related outcomes. The two most common measures were Body Mass Index and body mass, as of which almost all reported a trend of post intervention reduction. Some programmes reported qualitative data, identifying barriers to physical activity and preferred programme components, highlighting a need to consider factors outside of physiological measures. The findings provide guidance and direction for the development of future home-based physical activity and exercise programmes for adults living with overweight and obesity.

AB  - The occurrence of obesity has increased across the whole world. Many epidemiological studies have indicated that obesity strongly contributes to the development of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, liver diseases and other disorders, accounting for a heavy burden on the public and on health-care systems every year. Excess energy uptake induces adipocyte hypertrophy, hyperplasia and formation of visceral fat in other non-adipose tissues to evoke cardiovascular disease, liver diseases. Adipose tissue can also secrete adipokines and inflammatory cytokines to affect the local microenvironment, induce insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and activate associated inflammatory signaling pathways. This further exacerbates the development and progression of obesity-associated diseases. Although some progress in the treatment of obesity has been achieved in preclinical and clinical studies, the progression and pathogenesis of obesity-induced diseases are complex and unclear. We still need to understand their links to better guide the treatment of obesity and associated diseases. In this review, we review the links between obesity and other diseases, with a view to improve the future management and treatment of obesity and its co-morbidities.

AB  - Nowadays, aging is understood as a dynamic and multifaceted dysregulation process that spares almost no human organ or cell. The immune system being among the most affected, it has been shown predominantly that its integrity determines the tightrope walk between the difference of escaping or suffering from age-related diseases. Next to drug-based anti-aging strategies, micronutrient intervention may represent an emerging but less radical way to slow immune aging. While a sufficient supply of a variety of micronutrients is undeniably important, adequate intake of the trace element zinc appears to tower over others in terms of reaching old age. Inconveniently, zinc deficiency prevalence among the elderly is high, which in turn contributes to increased susceptibility to infection, decreased anti-tumor immunity as well as attenuated response to vaccination. Driven by this research, this review aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the various rebalancing capabilities of zinc in the unbalanced immune system of the elderly. This includes an in-depth and cell type-centered discussion on the role of zinc in immunosenescence and inflammaging. We further address upcoming translational aspects e.g. how zinc deficiency promotes the flourishing of certain pathogenic taxa of the gut microbiome and how zinc supply counteracts such alterations in a manner that may contribute to longevity. In the light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we also briefly review current knowledge on the interdependency between age, zinc status, and respiratory infections. Based on two concrete examples and considering the latest findings in the field we conclude our remarks by outlining tremendous parallels between suboptimal zinc status and accelerated aging on the one hand and an optimized zinc status and successful aging on the other hand.

AB  - Alcohol-associated liver disease is one of the main causes of chronic liver disease. It comprises a clinical-histologic spectrum of presentations, from steatosis, steatohepatitis, to different degrees of fibrosis, including cirrhosis and severe necroinflammatory disease, called alcohol-associated hepatitis. In this focused update, we aim to present specific therapeutic interventions and strategies for the management of alcohol-associated liver disease. Current evidence for management in all spectra of manifestations is derived from general chronic liver disease recommendations, but with a higher emphasis on abstinence and nutritional support. Abstinence should comprise the treatment of alcohol use disorder as well as withdrawal syndrome. Nutritional assessment should also consider the presence of sarcopenia and its clinical manifestation, frailty. The degree of compensation of the disease should be evaluated, and complications, actively sought. The most severe acute form of this disease is alcohol-associated hepatitis, which has high mortality and morbidity. Current treatment is based on corticosteroids that act by reducing immune activation and blocking cytotoxicity and inflammation pathways. Other aspects of treatment include preventing and treating hepatorenal syndrome as well as preventing infections although there is no clear evidence as to the benefit of probiotics and antibiotics in prophylaxis. Novel therapies for alcohol-associated hepatitis include metadoxine, interleukin-22 analogs, and interleukin-1-beta antagonists. Finally, granulocyte colony–stimulating factor, microbiota transplantation, and gut–liver axis modulation have shown promising results. We also discuss palliative care in advanced alcohol-associated liver disease.

AB  - Summary
Extracorporeal haemoadsorption is increasingly being used for the removal of endotoxin or inflammatory cytokines in patients with septic shock or other severe inflammatory states. A reduction in excessively high levels of inflammatory mediators—and mitigation of the devastating clinical impact of severe inflammation—might be a sound rationale for extracorporeal haemoadsorption in critical care, but the evidence for beneficial effects is uncertain. Few randomised controlled trials have been undertaken, and they have not provided reliable evidence for routine use in clinical practice. No study has shown a survival benefit, and only a few studies have shown a significant effect on patients' blood cytokine concentrations. Nonetheless, some clinicians have encouraged the use of haemoadsorption devices, largely on the basis of incomplete data or contentious interpretations of the available data. Further research is required, particularly well designed, prospective clinical trials assessing relevant patient-centred outcomes, including mortality, before widespread adoption of this technology can be recommended.

AB  - Summary
Introduction
Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is one of the new minimally invasive endoscopic treatments aimed at inducing weight loss. Its effectiveness in terms of weight loss is proven. Gastric volume reduction and delayed gastric emptying are the mechanisms that drive weight loss. However, potential benefits for co-morbidities in relation to weight loss after ESG are still being investigated. This study aims to evaluate the effect of ESG procedures on major obesity-associated co-morbidities, and on some biological parameters.
Patients and methods
This is a series of consecutive cases from a prospective observational study carried out in a specialized center that follows a standardized care pathway for the multimodal management of obesity. Patients who have undergone ESG with endoscopic and laboratory follow-up at six and twelve months after this intervention were included in the study. Prospectively recorded data on weight loss, co-morbidities and laboratory parameters at six and twelve months after surgery was analyzed retrospectively. Changes in body mass index (BMI), absolute weight loss (AWL), percent of excess weight loss (%EWL) and percent total weight loss (%TWL) were assessed at six and twelve months. Reduction in various obesity-related co-morbidities (arterial hypertension [AHT], type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM], gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD], obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [OSAS] and dyslipidemia was also evaluated at six and twelve months. Changes in blood glucose, liver function tests and lipid blood tests were also analyzed at six and twelve months.
Results
From October 2016 to July 2021, 99 of the 227 patients who underwent ESG in our unit (43.6%) subsequently underwent a complete endoscopic and laboratory follow-up at six and twelve months. The initial BMI was 42.7±7.8kg/m2 and age was 45±12.7 years. Seventy-four patients (74.8%) were female. Total weight loss (%TWL) and excess weight loss (%EWL) were 16.6±7.4% and 43.3±21.2%, respectively, at six months, 16.6±9.6% and 42.9±25.6%, respectively, at one year. At six and twelve month follow-up, a statistically significant reduction was observed for the rates of T2DM (30.8 and 32.7%), hypertension (18.4 and 22.1%), GERD (28 and 25.7%), OSAS (15.8 and 25.5%) and dyslipidemia (69.2 and 77.2%) (P<0.001). A statistically significant difference was found in the reduction in blood glucose between the pre-operative period and six months post-operatively (P<0.01) and between the pre-operative period and twelve months post-operatively (P<0.01). The reduction in triglycerides and total cholesterol between the pre-operative values and at six months was statistically significant (P<0.01) as was the reduction at twelve months (P<0.01) (P=0.017). For liver function tests, the reduction in AST was statistically significant at six and twelve months after ESG (P=0.048) (P=0.048) as was ALT (P<0.01) (P<0.01) respectively. From October 2016 to July 2021, of the 227 patients who underwent ESG, 99 (43.6%) had follow-up gastro-duodenoscopy at 6 and 12 months. %TWL and %EWL were respectively 16.6±7.4% and 43.3%±21.2 at 6 months, 16.6±9.6% and 42.9±25.6% at one year. Statistically significant reduction rates at 6 and 12 months were observed in T2DM (30.8 and 32.7%), AHT (18.4 and 22.1%), GERD (28 and 25.7%), OSAS (15.8 and 25.5%) and dyslipidemia (69.2 and 77.2%) (P<0.001). Moreover, glycemic levels were statistically significantly reduced between the pre-operative period and 6 months post-operative (1.11±0.22mg/L vs. 1.01±0.17mg/L, P<0.01), and between the pre-operative period and 12 months post-operative (1.11±0.22mg/L vs. 1.06±0.32mg/L, P<0.01). A statistically significant reduction was also observed in triglycerides and total cholesterol levels at 6 months (1.52±0.74mmol/L vs. 1.14±0.52mmol/L, P<0.01) (1.94±0.4mmol/L vs. 1.85±0.36mmol/L, P<0.01) and at 12 months (1.52±0.74mmol/L vs. 1.18±0.67mmol/L, P<0.01) (1.94±0.4mmol/L vs. 1.82±0.39mmol/L, P=0.017) and in AST (27.2±11.7 IU/L vs. 23.7 IU/L; P=0.048) (27.2±11.7 IU/L vs. 24.7±14.65 IU/L, P=0.048) and ALAT levels (34±21.32 IU/L vs. 22.3±10.4 IU/L, P<0.01 and 34±21.32 IU/L vs. 27.07±25 IU/L, P<0.01) at 6 and 12 months after ESG, respectively.
Conclusion
ESG is a well-tolerated and safe surgical procedure that is effective in terms of weight loss and reduction of obesity-related co-morbidities at six months and one year. This procedure could thus be adopted on a broader clinical scale and be more widely promoted as an effective treatment for morbid obesity.

AB  - Over the past few years, antiviral drugs against influenza are considered emerging contaminants since they cause environmental toxicity even at low concentrations. They have been found in environmental matrices all around the world, showing that conventional treatment methods fail to remove them from water and wastewater. In addition, the metabolites and transformation products of these drugs can be more persistent than original in the environment. Several techniques to degrade/remove antiviral drugs against influenza have been investigated to prevent this contamination. In this study, the characteristics of antiviral drugs against influenza, their measurement by analytical methods, and their removal in both water and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were presented. Different treatment methods, such as traditional procedures (biological processes, filtration, coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation), advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), adsorption and combined methods, were assessed. Ecotoxicological effects of both the antiviral drug and its metabolites as well as the transformation products formed as a result of treatment were evaluated. In addition, future perspectives for improving the removal of antiviral drugs against influenza, their metabolites and transformation products were further discussed. The research indicated that the main tested techniques in this study were ozonation, photolysis and photocatalysis. Combined methods, particularly those that use renewable energy and waste materials, appear to be the optimum approach for the treatment of effluents containing antiviral drugs against influenza. In light of high concentrations or probable antiviral resistance, this comprehensive assessment suggests that antiviral drug monitoring is required, and some of those substances may cause toxicological effects.

AB  - Recent decades witness an enormous increase in concentrations of environmental contaminants of human health concern. The research efforts attempt to develop synthetic (chemicals) and natural (biological) adsorbents for remediation of hazardous heavy metals, pesticides, mycotoxins, antibiotics, and other emerging pollutants. However, application of potential adsorbents in remediation lack selectivity and sustainability prospects. Present review aims to provide a critical discussion on adsorption potential of synthetic and natural adsorbents in sustainability framework. The synthetic adsorbents are discussed in terms of recipes and underlying sorption mechanisms. Herein, pragmatic analysis on novel synthetic adsorbents like ferrate, following green chemistry principles and engineered nanoparticles (NPs) is elucidated. In natural biosorbents (both live and dead biomass), the phyto-technologies, biosorption, natural/engineered biochar, clay, and chitosan are comprehensively reviewed. This panoramic review revealed that phytoremediation and biosorption can be preferred as ‘sustainable bioresource eco-technologies’ for remediation of chemical pollution. The interrelationship between adsorbents and United Nations- Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) is established. Eco-friendly and cost-effective biosorbents tend to follow the sustainability paradigm unlike traditional chemical adsorbents. In conclusion, the ‘biorefinery’, ‘Water-Energy-Food Nexus’ and ‘biocircular economy’ co-benefits of biosorbents can augment the sustainability indicators to help achieve salient SDGs.

AB  - Hypertension is the primary cause of cardiovascular diseases and is responsible for nearly 9 million deaths worldwide annually. Increasing evidence indicates that in addition to pathophysiologic processes, numerous environmental factors, such as geographic location, lifestyle choices, socioeconomic status, and cultural practices, influence the risk, progression, and severity of hypertension, even in the absence of genetic risk factors. In this review, we discuss the impact of some environmental determinants on hypertension. We focus on clinical data from large population studies and discuss some potential molecular and cellular mechanisms. We highlight how these environmental determinants are interconnected, as small changes in one factor might affect others, and further affect cardiovascular health. In addition, we discuss the crucial impact of socioeconomic factors and how these determinants influence diverse communities with economic disparities. Finally, we address opportunities and challenges for new research to address gaps in knowledge on understanding molecular mechanisms whereby environmental factors influence development of hypertension and associated cardiovascular disease.
Résumé
L’hypertension qui est la principale cause des maladies cardiovasculaires (MCV) est responsable de près de neuf millions de morts par année dans le monde. De plus en plus de données probantes montrent qu’en plus des processus physiopathologiques, de nombreux facteurs environnementaux tels que la situation géographique, les choix relatifs au mode de vie, le statut socioéconomique et les pratiques culturelles influencent le risque, la progression et la gravité de l’hypertension, même en l’absence de facteurs de risque génétiques. Dans le présent article, nous traitons des répercussions de certains déterminants environnementaux sur l’hypertension. Nous portons notre attention sur les données cliniques de vastes études de population et examinons certains mécanismes moléculaires et cellulaires potentiels. Nous décrivons comment ces déterminants environnementaux sont interreliés, et comment de petits changements dans l’un des facteurs pourraient avoir des répercussions sur les autres, et nuire davantage à la santé cardiovasculaire. De plus, nous traitons des importantes répercussions des facteurs socioéconomiques et de la façon dont ces déterminants influencent les diverses communautés marquées par des disparités économiques. Finalement, nous nous penchons sur les possibilités et les enjeux des nouvelles recherches à combler les lacunes dans les connaissances en matière de compréhension des mécanismes moléculaires par lesquelles les facteurs environnementaux influencent l’apparition de l’hypertension et des maladies cardiovasculaires associées.

AB  - Aerosolization of immunotherapies poses incredible potential for manipulating the local mucosal-specific microenvironment, engaging specialized pulmonary cellular defenders, and accessing mucosal associated lymphoid tissue to redirect systemic adaptive and memory responses. In this review, we breakdown key inhalable immunoengineering strategies for chronic, genetic, and infection-based inflammatory pulmonary disorders, encompassing the historic use of immunomodulatory agents, the transition to biological inspired or derived treatments, and novel approaches of complexing these materials into drug delivery vehicles for enhanced release outcomes. Alongside a brief description of key immune targets, fundamentals of aerosol drug delivery, and preclinical pulmonary models for immune response, we survey recent advances of inhaled immunotherapy platforms, ranging from small molecules and biologics to particulates and cell therapies, as well as prophylactic vaccines. In each section, we address the formulation design constraints for aerosol delivery as well as advantages for each platform in driving desirable immune modifications. Finally, prospects of clinical translation and outlook for inhaled immune engineering are discussed.

AB  - Heparinases are enzymes that selectively cleave heparin and heparan sulfate chains, via cleavage of the glycosidic linkage between hexosamines and uronic acids, producing disaccharide and oligosaccharide products. While heparin is well known as an anti-coagulant drug, heparin and heparan sulfate are also involved in biological processes such as inflammation, cancer and angiogenesis and viral and bacterial infections and are of growing interest for their therapeutic potential. Recently, potential roles of heparin and heparan sulfate in relation to COVID-19 infection have been highlighted. The ability of heparinases to selectively cleave heparin chains has been exploited industrially to produce low molecular weight heparin, which has replaced heparin in several clinical applications. Other applications of heparinases include heparin and heparan sulfate structural analysis, neutralisation of heparin in blood and removal of the inhibitory effect of heparin on various enzymes. Heparinases are known to inhibit neovascularization and heparinase III is of interest for treating cancer and inhibiting tumour cell growth. Heparinase activity, first isolated from Pedobacter heparinus, has since been reported from several other microorganisms. Significant progress has been made in the production, characterisation and improvement of microbial heparinases in response to application demands in terms of heparinase yield and purity, which is likely to extend their usefulness in various applications. This review focuses on recent developments in the identification, characterisation and improvement of microbial heparinases and their established and emerging industrial, clinical and therapeutic applications.

AB  - Chitosan-loaded nanomedicines provide a greater opportunity for the treatment of respiratory diseases. Natural biopolymer chitosan and its derivatives have a large number of proven pharmacological actions like antioxidant, wound healing, immuno-stimulant, hypocholesterolemic, antimicrobial, obesity treatment, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, bone tissue engineering, antifungal, regenerative medicine, anti-diabetic and mucosal adjuvant, etc. which attracted its use in the pharmaceutical industry. As compared to other polysaccharides, chitosan has excellent mucoadhesive characteristics, less viscous, easily modified into the chemical and biological molecule and gel-forming property due to which the drugs retain in the respiratory tract for a longer period of time providing enhanced therapeutic action of the drug. Chitosan-based nanomedicines would have the greatest effect when used to transport poor water soluble drugs, macromolecules like proteins, and peptides through the lungs. In this review, we highlight and discuss the role of chitosan and its nanomedicines in the treatment of chronic respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, asthma, COPD, lung cancer, tuberculosis, and COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
Cancer screening has the potential to decrease mortality from several common cancer types. The first cancer screening programme in China was initiated in 1958 and the Cancer High Incidence Fields established in the 1970s have provided an extensive source of information for national cancer screening programmes. From 2012 onwards, four ongoing national cancer screening programmes have targeted eight cancer types: cervical, breast, colorectal, lung, oesophageal, stomach, liver, and nasopharyngeal cancers. By synthesising evidence from pilot screening programmes and population-based studies for various screening tests, China has developed a series of cancer screening guidelines. Nevertheless, challenges remain for the implementation of a fully successful population-based programme. The aim of this Review is to highlight the key milestones and the current status of cancer screening in China, describe what has been achieved to date, and identify the barriers in transitioning from evidence to implementation. We also make a set of implementation recommendations on the basis of the Chinese experience, which might be useful in the establishment of cancer screening programmes in other countries.

AB  - Background
Respiratory microbiome composition depends on an intricate balance between host characteristics, diet, and environmental factors. Some studies indicate a bidirectional relationship between respiratory microbiota and disease. Air pollution is consistently associated with increased respiratory morbidity and mortality in different populations and across different ages. The aim of this review was to report a summary of the evidence regarding the impact of air pollution on the upper and lower respiratory tract microbiome.
Methods
A literature search from interaction between air pollution and respiratory microbiome was performed (2010–2022).
Results
Sixteen studies demonstrated changes in microbiome with both environmental and household air pollution. Increasing levels of air pollutants are associated with lower relative abundance of Corynebacterium and increasing levels of pathogen colonization, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, altering the incidence and clinical course of respiratory infections. This ultimately leads to an excess of morbidity and mortality due to antimicrobial resistance.
Conclusion
Changes of air pollution on the respiratory microbiome may influence respiratory infections in critical care. Use of probiotics may restore the diversity of baseline microbiome, preventing infections by resistant organisms in the critical care setting. Using protective equipment decreased the effect of air pollutants on increasing potentially pathogenic microorganisms.

AB  - It is widely held that schizophrenia involves an active process of peripheral inflammation that induces or reflects brain inflammation with activation of microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells. However, recent in vivo radioligand binding studies and large-scale transcriptomics in post-mortem brain report reduced markers of microglial inflammation. The findings suggest a contrary hypothesis; that microglia are diverted into their non-inflammatory synaptic remodelling phenotype that interferes with neurodevelopment and perhaps contributes to the relapsing nature of schizophrenia. Recent discoveries on the regulatory interactions between micro- and astroglial cells and immune regulatory T cells (Tregs) cohere with clinical omics data to suggest that: i) disinhibited astrocytes mediate the shift in microglial phenotype via the production of transforming growth factor-beta, which also contributes to the disturbances of dopamine and GABA function in schizophrenia, and ii) systemically impaired functioning of Treg cells contributes to the dysregulation of glial function, the low-grade peripheral inflammation, and the hitherto unexplained predisposition to auto-immunity and reduced life-expectancy in schizophrenia, including greater COVID-19 mortality.

AB  - Estimating the contribution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to global mortality and healthcare costs enables evaluation of interventions, informs policy decisions on resource allocation, and drives research priorities. However assembling the high quality, patient-level data required for global estimates is challenging. Capacity for accurate microbiology culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is woefully neglected in low and middle-income countries, and further surveillance and research on community antimicrobial usage, bias in blood culture sampling, and the contribution of co-morbidities such as diabetes is essential. International collaboration between governments, policy makers, academics, microbiologists, front-line clinicians, veterinarians, the food and agriculture industry and the public is critical to understand and tackle AMR.

AB  - Summary
Climate change has a broad range of health impacts and tackling climate change could be the greatest opportunity for improving global health this century. Yet conversations on climate change and health are often incomplete, giving little attention to structural discrimination and the need for racial justice. Racism kills, and climate change kills. Together, racism and climate change interact and have disproportionate effects on the lives of minoritised people both within countries and between the Global North and the Global South. This paper has three main aims. First, to survey the literature on the unequal health impacts of climate change due to racism, xenophobia, and discrimination through a scoping review. We found that racially minoritised groups, migrants, and Indigenous communities face a disproportionate burden of illness and mortality due to climate change in different contexts. Second, this paper aims to highlight inequalities in responsibility for climate change and the effects thereof. A geographical visualisation of responsibility for climate change and projected mortality and disease risk attributable to climate change per 100 000 people in 2050 was conducted. These maps visualise the disproportionate burden of illness and mortality due to climate change faced by the Global South. Our third aim is to highlight the pathways through which climate change, discrimination, and health interact in most affected areas. Case studies, testimony, and policy analysis drawn from multidisciplinary perspectives are presented throughout the paper to elucidate these pathways. The health community must urgently examine and repair the structural discrimination that drives the unequal impacts of climate change to achieve rapid and equitable action.

AB  - The current widespread of COVID-19 all over the world, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, has again emphasized the importance of development of point-of-care (POC) diagnostics for timely prevention and control of the pandemic. Compared with labor- and time-consuming traditional diagnostic methods, POC diagnostics exhibit several advantages such as faster diagnostic speed, better sensitivity and specificity, lower cost, higher efficiency and ability of on-site detection. To achieve POC diagnostics, developing POC detection methods and correlated POC devices is the key and should be given top priority. The fast development of microfluidics, micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, nanotechnology and materials science, have benefited the production of a series of portable, miniaturized, low cost and highly integrated POC devices for POC diagnostics of various infectious diseases. In this review, various POC detection methods for the diagnosis of infectious diseases, including electrochemical biosensors, fluorescence biosensors, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based biosensors, colorimetric biosensors, chemiluminiscence biosensors, surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensors, and magnetic biosensors, were first summarized. Then, recent progresses in the development of POC devices including lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices, lab-on-a-disc (LOAD) devices, microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs), lateral flow devices, miniaturized PCR devices, and isothermal nucleic acid amplification (INAA) devices, were systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives for the design and development of POC detection methods and correlated devices were presented. The ultimate goal of this review is to provide new insights and directions for the future development of POC diagnostics for the management of infectious diseases and contribute to the prevention and control of infectious pandemics like COVID-19.

AB  - Road dust pollution is a complex atmospheric issue that poses a significant ecotoxicological threat to human health and the environment. The presence of viruses in road dust can put humans at risk of infection, as airborne viral particles are a potential synergist to respiratory infirmities, leading to widespread mortality and morbidity. This corroborates the increasing number of desk-based studies on the effects of road dust. However, the role of road dust in the spread and pathogenicity of viruses has scarcely been explored, and there is still no certainty regarding whether road dust participates in viral transmission or causes infectious diseases. Therefore, the current knowledge and mechanisms of road-dust-associated viruses and other pathogenic microorganisms are critically reviewed, highlighting the importance of keeping an eye out for road-dust-associated viruses, as they represent hotspots for viral transmission. In this overview, we evaluate the emissions, associated contaminants, and public health implications of exposure to road-dust-associated viruses. A summary of potential mitigation measures is also presented, highlighting critical knowledge gaps, challenges, and future research directions that require urgent draconian measures. This overview is intended to serve as a seminal reference and management pivot for enhancing global pollution mitigation policies, development of analytical models/methods, periodic monitoring of road dust-associated viruses, and the transport of other pathogenic microorganisms.

AB  - Hypertension is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases worldwide. However, in the population of resistant hypertension, blood pressure is difficult to control effectively. Moreover, antihypertensive drugs may have adverse effect currently. Hence, new therapeutic targets and treatments are needed to uncovered and exploited to control hypertension and its comorbidities. In the past, classical drug targets, such as the aldosterone receptor, aldosterone synthase, and ACE2/angiotensin 1–7/Mas receptor axis, have been investigated. Recently, vaccines and drugs targeting the gastrointestinal microbiome, which represent drug classes, have also been investigated for the management of blood pressure. In this review, we summarized current knowledge on classical and new drug targets and discussed the potential utility of new drugs in the treatment of hypertension.

AB  - The author, the journal, Computers in Biology and Medicine (CBM), and Elsevier Press more generally, played a helpful very early role in responding to COVID-19. Within a few days of the appearance of the “Wuhan Seafood isolate” genome on GenBank, a bioinformatics study was posted by the present author in ResearchGate in January 2020, “Preliminary Bioinformatics Studies on the Design of Synthetic Vaccines and Preventative Peptidomimetic Antagonists against the Wuhan Seafood Market Coronavirus. Possible Importance of the KRSFIEDLLFNKV Motif” DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.18275.09761. On February 2nd, 2020, a more thorough analysis was submitted to CBM, e-published on February 26, and formally published in April 2020, at about the same time as the virus named as 2019n-CoV was identified as essentially SARS and renames SARS-COV-2. This was followed by four further papers describing in more detail some previously unreported aspects of the early investigation. The speed of research and writing of the papers was made possible by knowledge-gathering tools. Based on this and earlier experiences with fast responses to emerging epidemics such as HIV and Mad Cow Disease, it is possible to envisage the nature of a speedier response to emerging epidemics and new variants of concern in established epidemics.

AB  - There are a growing number of studies investigating how grounding (earthing) the body may benefit biological performance and aid the treatment of non-communicable diseases. Research also indicates how biological grounding initiatives can sometimes be compromised, or inappropriate, and the need to take additional factors into account as potential contributory factors, or confounders, to expected results. It is proposed that expanding electromagnetic hygiene measures beyond biological grounding alone may help reduce spread of communicable diseases, incidence of respiratory conditions, neurodegenerative disease and all-cause mortality. Identifying potential synergies that exist could enable multilevel interventions to further increase the efficacy of measures. It is hoped that this review will help act as a catalyst to inspire and inform multi-disciplinary research within these topic areas, best practices and policies to help drive medical innovation, reduce health burdens, improve bioelectromagnetic-based therapies, and influence the general design of the built environment and next-generation technologies.

AB  - Monocyte Distribution Width (MDW) is a new generation cell blood count parameter providing a measure of monocyte anisocytosis. In the last decades, it has emerged as a reliable biomarker of sepsis in the acute setting, especially emergency department, and intensive care unit. MDW has several advantages over commonly used sepsis biomarkers, including low-cost, ease and speed of measurement. The clinical usefulness of MDW has been established in several studies and some clinical laboratory medicines have already implemented it in their routine. In this article, we describe the analytical and clinical features of MDW to guide its appropriate use in clinical practice by integrating the research evidence with real-world laboratory experience. The proper use of a biomarker is critical for improving patients’ care and outcome as well as ensuring healthcare quality.

AB  - Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated fungal pathogen that causes infection in immunocompromised individuals such as HIV patients, organ transplant patients, hematological malignancies, diabetes patients, etc. The most common invasive fungal pathogens are Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., and Cryptococcus spp. Cryptococcal meningitis has become increasingly common in immunocompromised patients resulting in a death rate of up to 90%. In low-income and middle-income countries, C. neoformans is a neglected killer in most parts of the world. It has unique and complicated virulence factors that facilitate its intracellular survival and dissemination. The initial infection, latency, or dissemination of the pathogen is determined by its specific morphological features such as capsule size, melanin pigment, biofilm development, etc. In this review, we discussed the worldwide distribution, classification of Cryptococcus spp., and a major focus on the pathogen's strategies that allow it to survive, proliferate subsequently disseminate resulting in cellular damage and treatment.

AB  - Introduction
The COVID-19 crisis has exposed inadequacy to deal with such health emergencies. The state of healthcare facilities in India is shambolic, which is further exacerbated by the exclusivity of modern health systems. The authors argue for vertical and horizontal expansion of the existing system to include traditional medicine systems, in favor of an urgently needed holistic and more inclusive healthcare system.
Methods
Secondary data were collected from free online resources, including preprints, reprints and databases, J-gate Plus, PubMed and Web of Science, using keywords such as, “folk medicine”, “folk medicine AND India”, “traditional Indian medicines”, “indigenous Indian medicines AND India”, “Indian ethnomedicines”, “Indian AND folk AND medicine”, “indigenous Indian medicine”.
Results and conclusions
Insufficiently robust public healthcare infrastructure, lack of enough qualified health professionals, and poor use of its traditional medicinal systems, are limiting the access of basic healthcare facilities to a large section of the Indian population. Despite vehement opposition and criticism from modern health system practitioners, indigenous and local healing traditions do offer benefits and share a common global goal of health and healing. The objectives of Universal Health Coverage and Health for All as enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cannot be achieved without their involvement, especially in remote and economically disadvantaged regions of the country. Even a sub-optimal utilization of its biological and human resources and related traditional knowledge can not only profoundly change the health, but also the economic landscape of India. Here, we have nuanced the constrains posed by the emerging health challenges, status and prospects of the great and little traditions of the Indian System of Medicines in fulfilling the urgent healthcare needs of the country. The authors based their arguments on the available evidence, rather than emotive ideas or, as a fan of Indian traditional medicines, and suggest for the purposeful inclusion of traditional health systems and practitioners more actively in India’s health care delivery systems. The country must not squander the opportunities offered by its traditional medicinal systems.

AB  - The innate immune response provides the first line of defense against infection and disease. Regulated cell death (RCD) is a key component of innate immune activation, and RCD must be tightly controlled to clear pathogens while preventing excess inflammation. Recent studies have highlighted a central role for the innate immune sensor Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) as an activator of a form of inflammatory RCD called PANoptosis, which is regulated by a multifaceted cell death complex called the PANoptosome. In response to influenza A virus infection, ZBP1 activates the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which then acts as an integral component of the ZBP1-PANoptosome to drive inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis. In this context, the NLRP3 inflammasome is critical for caspase-1 activation and proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 maturation, but dispensable for cell death due to functional redundancies between PANoptosome molecules. Similarly, ZBP1 is also central to the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-PANoptosome; this PANoptosome forms in response to Francisella novicida and herpes simplex virus 1 infection and incorporates the AIM2 inflammasome as an integral component. In this review, we will discuss the critical roles of ZBP1 in mediating innate immune responses through inflammasomes, PANoptosomes, and PANoptosis during infection. An improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of innate immunity and cell death will be essential for the development of targeted modalities that can improve patient outcomes by mitigating severe disease.

AB  - The simultaneous maturation of multiple digital and telecommunications technologies in 2020 has created an unprecedented opportunity for ophthalmology to adapt to new models of care using tele-health supported by digital innovations. These digital innovations include artificial intelligence (AI), 5th generation (5G) telecommunication networks and the Internet of Things (IoT), creating an inter-dependent ecosystem offering opportunities to develop new models of eye care addressing the challenges of COVID-19 and beyond. Ophthalmology has thrived in some of these areas partly due to its many image-based investigations. Tele-health and AI provide synchronous solutions to challenges facing ophthalmologists and healthcare providers worldwide. This article reviews how countries across the world have utilised these digital innovations to tackle diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, refractive error correction, cataract and other anterior segment disorders. The review summarises the digital strategies that countries are developing and discusses technologies that may increasingly enter the clinical workflow and processes of ophthalmologists. Furthermore as countries around the world have initiated a series of escalating containment and mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of eye care services globally has been significantly impacted. As ophthalmic services adapt and form a “new normal”, the rapid adoption of some of telehealth and digital innovation during the pandemic is also discussed. Finally, challenges for validation and clinical implementation are considered, as well as recommendations on future directions.

AB  - The main role of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is the transfer of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. There is a long history of investigations regarding the inhibition of CETP as a target for reducing major adverse cardiovascular events. Initially, the potential effect on cardiovascular events of CETP inhibitors was hypothesized to be mediated by their ability to increase HDL cholesterol, but, based on evidence from anacetrapib and the newest CETP inhibitor, obicetrapib, it is now understood to be primarily due to reducing LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. Nevertheless, evidence is also mounting that other roles of HDL, including its promotion of cholesterol efflux, as well as its apolipoprotein composition and anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-diabetic properties, may play important roles in several diseases beyond cardiovascular disease, including, but not limited to, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, and sepsis. Furthermore, although Mendelian randomization analyses suggested that higher HDL cholesterol is associated with increased risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), excess risk of AMD was absent in all CETP inhibitor randomized controlled trial data comprising over 70,000 patients. In fact, certain HDL subclasses may, in contrast, be beneficial for treating the retinal cholesterol accumulation that occurs with AMD. This review describes the latest biological evidence regarding the relationship between HDL and CETP inhibition for Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, sepsis, and AMD.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) has caused major public health crises. There have been more than 4,400,000 reported cases of COVID-2019 and more than 300,000 reported deaths to date (16/05/2020). SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have attracted widespread global attention due to their high infectivity and pathogenicity. To date, there is no specific treatment proven effective against these viral infectious diseases. Vaccination is considered one of the most effective strategies to prevent viral infections. Therefore, the development of effective vaccines against highly pathogenic coronaviruses is essential. In this review, we will briefly describe coronavirus vaccine design targets, summarize recent advances in the development of coronavirus vaccines, and highlight current adjuvants for improving the efficacy of coronavirus vaccines.

AB  - Infectious diseases, once believed to be an eradicable public health threat, still represent a leading cause of death worldwide. Environmental and social changes continuously favor the emergence of new pathogens and rapid dissemination around the world. The limited availability of anti-viral therapies and increased antibiotic resistance has made the therapeutic management of infectious disease a major challenge. Inflammation is a primordial defense to protect the host against invading microorganisms. However, dysfunctional inflammatory responses contribute to disease severity and mortality during infections. In recent years, a few studies have examined the relevance of resolution of inflammation in the context of infections. Inflammation resolution is an active integrated process transduced by several pro-resolving mediators, including Annexin A1 and Angiotensin-(1-7). Here, we examine some of the cellular and molecular circuits triggered by pro-resolving molecules and that may be beneficial in the context of infectious diseases.

SARS-CoV-2, which causes the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), presents high rates of morbidity and mortality around the world. The search to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing and urgent. This systematic review seeks to assess whether photodynamic therapy (PDT) could be effective in SARS-CoV-2 inactivation.
Methods
The focus question was: Can photodynamic therapy be used as potential guidance for dealing with SARS-CoV-2?”. A literature search, according to PRISMA statements, was conducted in the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, LILACS, and Google Scholar. Studies published from January 2004 to June 2020 were analyzed. In vitro and in vivo studies were included that evaluated the effect of PDT mediated by several photosensitizers on RNA and DNA enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.
Results
From 27 selected manuscripts, 26 publications used in vitro studies, 24 were exclusively in vitro, and two had in vitro/in vivo parts. Only one analyzed publication was exclusively in vivo. Meta-analysis studies were unfeasible due to heterogeneity of the data. The risk of bias was analyzed in all studies.
Conclusion
The in vitro and in vivo studies selected in this systematic review indicated that PDT is capable of photoinactivating enveloped and non-enveloped DNA and RNA viruses, suggesting that PDT can potentially photoinactivate SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Summary
Chronic kidney disease is a progressive disease with no cure and high morbidity and mortality that occurs commonly in the general adult population, especially in people with diabetes and hypertension. Preservation of kidney function can improve outcomes and can be achieved through non-pharmacological strategies (eg, dietary and lifestyle adjustments) and chronic kidney disease-targeted and kidney disease-specific pharmacological interventions. A plant-dominant, low-protein, and low-salt diet might help to mitigate glomerular hyperfiltration and preserve renal function for longer, possibly while also leading to favourable alterations in acid-base homoeostasis and in the gut microbiome. Pharmacotherapies that alter intrarenal haemodynamics (eg, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone pathway modulators and SGLT2 [SLC5A2] inhibitors) can preserve kidney function by reducing intraglomerular pressure independently of blood pressure and glucose control, whereas other novel agents (eg, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) might protect the kidney through anti-inflammatory or antifibrotic mechanisms. Some glomerular and cystic kidney diseases might benefit from disease-specific therapies. Managing chronic kidney disease-associated cardiovascular risk, minimising the risk of infection, and preventing acute kidney injury are crucial interventions for these patients, given the high burden of complications, associated morbidity and mortality, and the role of non-conventional risk factors in chronic kidney disease. When renal replacement therapy becomes inevitable, an incremental transition to dialysis can be considered and has been proposed to possibly preserve residual kidney function longer. There are similarities and distinctions between kidney-preserving care and supportive care. Additional studies of dietary and pharmacological interventions and development of innovative strategies are necessary to ensure optimal kidney-preserving care and to achieve greater longevity and better health-related quality of life for these patients.

AB  - Background
Respiratory diseases are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and are exacerbated by air pollution and temperature.
Aim
To assess published literature on the effect of air pollution modified by temperature on respiratory mortality and hospital admissions.
Methods
We identified 26,656 papers in PubMed and Web of Science, up to March 2021, and selected for analysis; inclusion criteria included observational studies, short-term air pollution, and temperature exposure. Air pollutants considered were particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 μg/m3, and 10 μg/m3 (PM2.5, and PM10), ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). A random-effects model was used for our meta-analysis.
Results
For respiratory mortality we found that when the effect PM10 is modified by high temperatures there is an increased pooled Odds Ratio [OR, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)] of 1.021 (1.008 to 1.034) and for the effect of O3 the pooled OR is 1.006 (1.001–1.012) during the warm season. For hospital admissions, the effects of PM10 and O3 respectively, during the warm season found an increased pooled OR of 1.011 (0.999–1.024), and 1.015 (0.995–1.036). In our analysis for low temperatures, results were inconsistent.
Conclusions
Exposure to air pollution when modified by high temperature is likely to increase the odds of respiratory mortality and hospital admissions. Analysis on the interaction effect of air pollution and temperature on health outcomes is a relatively new research field and results are largely inconsistent; therefore, further research is encouraged to establish a more conclusive conclusion on the strength and direction of this effect.

AB  - Hypoxia is the main cause and effect of a large number of diseases, including the most recent one facing the world, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Hypoxia is divided into short-term, long-term, and periodic, it can be the result of diseases, climate change, or living and traveling in the high mountain regions of the world. Since each type of hypoxia can be a cause and a consequence of various physiological changes, the methods for modeling these hypoxias are also different. There are many techniques for modeling hypoxia under experimental conditions. The most common animal for modeling hypoxia is a rat. Hypoxia models (hypoxia simulations) in rats are a tool to study the effect of various conditions on the oxygen supply of the body. These models can provide a necessary information to understand hypoxia and also provide effective treatment, highlighting the importance of various reactions of the body to hypoxia. The main parameters when choosing a model should be reproducibility and the goal that the scientist wants to achieve. Hypoxia in rats can be reproduced both ways exogenously and endogenously. The reason for writing this review was the aim to systematize the models of rats available in the literature in order to facilitate their selection by scientists. The relative strengths and limitations of each model need to be identified and understood in order to evaluate the information obtained from these models and extrapolate these results to humans to develop the necessary generalizations. Despite these problems, animal models have been and remain vital to understanding the mechanisms involved in the development and progression of hypoxia. The eligibility criteria for the selected studies was a comprehensive review of the methods and results obtained from the studies. This made it possible to make generalizations and give recommendations on the application of these methods. The review will assist scientists in choosing an appropriate hypoxia simulation method, as well as assist in interpreting the results obtained with these methods.

AB  - The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the second of three zoonotic coronaviruses to infect humans since 2002, causing severe pneumonia. Unlike SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, the causes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Covid-19, respectively, MERS-CoV is enzootic in dromedary camels, a domestic/companion animal present across Africa, the Middle East and Central or South Asia and is sporadically transmitted to humans. However, it does not transmit readily from human to human except in hospital and household settings. Human MERS disease is reported only from the Arabian Peninsula (and only since 2012 even though the virus was detected in camels from at least the early 1990’s) and in travelers from this region. Remarkably, no zoonotic MERS disease has been detected in Africa or Asia, even in areas of high density of MERS-CoV infected dromedaries. Here, we review aspects of MERS biology and epidemiology that might contribute to this lack of correlation between sites of camel infection and human zoonotic disease. Since MERS-CoV or MERS-like CoV have pandemic potential, further investigations into this disparity is critical, to forestall pandemics caused by this virus.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Hemodynamic complications frequently affect vascular access and are important causes of morbidity and mortality. We present a review of acute complications affecting vascular accesses, focusing on classical and new treatments. Acute complications in hemodialysis vascular access are often underestimated and undertreated, and can present a challenge for both vascular surgeons and anesthesiologists. Accordingly, we considered different anesthesiologic approaches to both hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic patients. A strict collaboration among nephrologists, surgeons, and anesthesiologists can potentially improve prevention and management of acute complications and quality of life.

AB  - Resting heart rate is a determinant of cardiac output and physiological homeostasis. Although a simple, but critical, parameter, this vital sign predicts adverse outcomes, including mortality, and development of diseases in otherwise normal and healthy individuals. Temporal changes in heart rate can have valuable predictive capabilities. Heart rate can reflect disease severity in patients with various medical conditions. While heart rate represents a compilation of physiological inputs, including sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, aside from the underlying intrinsic sinus rate, how resting heart rate affects outcomes is uncertain. Mechanisms relating resting heart rate to outcomes may be disease-dependent but why resting heart rate in otherwise healthy, normal individuals affects outcomes remains obscure. For specific conditions, physiologically appropriate heart rate reductions may improve outcomes. However, to date, in the normal population, evidence that interventions aimed at reducing heart rate improves outcomes remains undefined. Emerging data suggest that reduction in heart rate via vagal activation and/or sympathetic inhibition is propitious.

AB  - Despite substantial progress in long-term follow-up strategies for lung transplant recipients, morbidity and mortality remain high, mostly because of the elevated infectious risk and the development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction. The high immunosuppressive levels necessary to prevent acute rejection and the graft’s constant exposure to the environment come at the high price of frequent infectious complications. Moreover, some infectious agents have been shown to trigger acute rejection or chronic allograft dysfunction. A rapid diagnostic approach followed by an early treatment and follow-up strategy are of paramount importance. However, these are challenging endeavors because of the vast spectrum of possible pathogens and the discrete clinical features resulting form transplant recipients’ impaired immune responses. This review proposes a stratified diagnostic strategy and discusses the most relevant pathogens and the corresponding therapeutic approaches, while also offering insight on infection prevention strategies: vaccination, prophylaxis, pre-emptive therapy, and antibiotic stewardship.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterised by acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, which is not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. ARDS is defined by the Berlin criteria. In this Series paper the diagnosis, management, outcomes, and long-term sequelae of ARDS are reviewed. Potential limitations of the ARDS definition and evidence that could inform future revisions are considered. Guideline recommendations, evidence, and uncertainties in relation to ARDS management are discussed. The future of ARDS strives towards a precision medicine approach, and the framework of treatable traits in ARDS diagnosis and management is explored.

AB  - Background
The viral infections can be highly contagious and easily transmissible, which even can lead to a pandemic, like the recent COVID-19 outbreak, causing massive deaths worldwide. While, still the best practical way to prevent the transmission of viruses is to practice self-sanitation and follow social distancing principles, enhancing the individual's immunity through the consumption of proper foods containing balanced nutrients can have significant result against viral infections. Foods containing nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, few polysaccharides, and some non-nutrients (i.e. polyphenols) have shown therapeutic potential against the function of viruses and can increase the immunity of people.
Scope and approach
The results of conducted works aiming for studying the potential antiviral characteristics of diverse groups of foods and food's nutrients (in terms of polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, vitamins, and minerals) are critically discussed.
Key findings and conclusion
Nutrients, besides playing an important role in maintaining normal physiology of human's body and healthiness, are also required for enhancing the immunity of the body and can be effective against viral infections. They can present antiviral capacity either by entering into the defensive mechanism directly through interfering with the target viruses, or indirectly through activating the cells associated with the adaptive immune system. During the current situation of COVID-19 pandemic (the lack of proper curative viral drug), enhancing the immunity of individual's body through proposing the appropriate diet (rich in both macro and micro-nutrients) is one of few practical preventive measures available in fighting against Coronaviruses, this significant health-threatening virus, as well as other viruses in general.

AB  - The interleukin (IL)-1 family member IL-1α is a ubiquitous and pivotal pro-inflammatory cytokine. The IL-1α precursor is constitutively present in nearly all cell types in health, but is released upon necrotic cell death as a bioactive mediator. IL-1α is also expressed by infiltrating myeloid cells within injured tissues. The cytokine binds the IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1), as does IL-1β, and induces the same pro-inflammatory effects. Being a bioactive precursor released upon tissue damage and necrotic cell death, IL-1α is central to the pathogenesis of numerous conditions characterized by organ or tissue inflammation. These include conditions affecting the lung and respiratory tract, dermatoses and inflammatory skin disorders, systemic sclerosis, myocarditis, pericarditis, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, inflammatory thrombosis, as well as complex multifactorial conditions such as COVID-19, vasculitis and Kawasaki disease, Behcet’s syndrome, Sjogren Syndrome, and cancer. This review illustrates the clinical relevance of IL-1α to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, as well as the rationale for the targeted inhibition of this cytokine for treatment of these conditions. Three biologics are available to reduce the activities of IL-1α; the monoclonal antibody bermekimab, the IL-1 soluble receptor rilonacept, and the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra. These advances in mechanistic understanding and therapeutic management make it incumbent on physicians to be aware of IL-1α and of the opportunity for therapeutic inhibition of this cytokine in a broad spectrum of diseases.

AB  - Summary
Diabetes is pervasive, exponentially growing in prevalence, and outpacing most diseases globally. In this Series paper, we use new theoretical frameworks and a narrative review of existing literature to show how structural inequity (structural racism and geographical inequity) has accelerated rates of diabetes disease, morbidity, and mortality globally. We discuss how structural inequity leads to large, fixed differences in key, upstream social determinants of health, which influence downstream social determinants of health and resultant diabetes outcomes in a cascade of widening inequity. We review categories of social determinants of health with known effects on diabetes outcomes, including public awareness and policy, economic development, access to high-quality care, innovations in diabetes management, and sociocultural norms. We also provide regional perspectives, grounded in our theoretical framework, to highlight prominent, real-world challenges.

AB  - Cardiac rehabilitation(CR) has known proven benefits in reducing mortality related to cardiovascular disease (CVD), improving quality of life (QoL), and preventing CVD-related readmissions. Despite these known benefits, CR remains underutilized among women relative to men. Disparities exist at the level of referral, enrollment, and program completion. Much is left to be understood regarding the utility of CR in female-predominant CVD such as postpartum cardiomyopathy and Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection. This review identifies the benefits of CR for specific populations of women and elucidates on the barriers to CR. We also describe current recommendations to overcome barriers to CR in women.

AB  - Background
Guidelines provide class I recommendations for aortic valve intervention for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) or reduced ejection fraction, but the cornerstone of management for asymptomatic patients has been watchful waiting. This is based on historical nonrandomized data, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have now been performed of early surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for asymptomatic severe AS. We performed a meta-analysis of RCTs comparing early SAVR to watchful waiting for asymptomatic severe AS, focusing on individual end points of death and heart failure (HF) hospitalization.
Methods
We systematically identified all RCTs comparing early SAVR to watchful waiting in patients with asymptomatic severe AS and synthesized the data in a random-effects meta-analysis. The prespecified primary end point was all-cause mortality.
Results
Two trials randomizing 302 patients were included. Early SAVR lead to a 55% reduction in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.85; P = .014). There was no heterogeneity (I2 = 0.0%). Early SAVR also lead to a 79% reduction in HF hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.96; P = .044).
Conclusions:
In patients with severe asymptomatic AS and normal ejection fraction, early SAVR reduces death and HF hospitalization compared to initial conservative management. This challenges current treatment standards and has implications for the clinical care of these patients and for guidelines.

AB  - Summary
Despite health gains over the past 30 years, children and adolescents are not reaching their health potential in many low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In addition to health systems, social systems, such as schools, communities, families, and digital platforms, can be used to promote health. We did a targeted literature review of how well health and social systems are meeting the needs of children in LMICs using the framework of The Lancet Global Health Commission on high-quality health systems and we reviewed evidence for structural reforms in health and social sectors. We found that quality of services for children is substandard across both health and social systems. Health systems have deficits in care competence (eg, diagnosis and management), system competence (eg, timeliness, continuity, and referral), user experience (eg, respect and usability), service provision for common and serious conditions (eg, cancer, trauma, and mental health), and service offerings for adolescents. Education and social services for child health are limited by low funding and poor coordination with other sectors. Structural reforms are more likely to improve service quality substantially and at scale than are micro-level efforts. Promising approaches include governing for quality (eg, leadership, expert management, and learning systems), redesigning service delivery to maximise outcomes, and empowering families to better care for children and to demand quality care from health and social systems. Additional research is needed on health needs across the life course, health system performance for children and families, and large-scale evaluation of promising health and social programmes.

AB  - Aim
To establish whether nurses are well prepared to provide nutrition care by identifying studies that evaluated undergraduate (baccalaureate) student nurses’ nutrition knowledge, practices and selfcare and to identify areas for improvement.
Background
The importance of nutrition care in health is well recognised, with poor nutrition behaviour contributing to many million deaths annually and to less resilience to COVID 19. Nurses as the largest health professional group are ideally positioned to provide basic nutrition care.
Design
Integrative Review
Methods
Whittemore & Knafl’s integrative review methodology guided this review. Appropriate search terms were used in seven databases (PubMed, Medline, Embase, ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health, the Royal College of Nursing Journals, Scopus) for Undergraduate nurses’ nutrition knowledge during the period 2010–2020. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool.
Results
Of the 250 studies identified, ten studies met the inclusion criteria: seven studies also investigated nurses’ eating patterns and health habits. Two themes emerged from data synthesis and analysis. Nursing students lack sufficient nutrition knowledge to develop the professional capacity to provide effective nutrition care to patients; nursing students’ eating patterns and health habits suggest insufficient nutrition knowledge for appropriate selfcare.
Conclusion
Improvements in undergraduate nutrition care are required. Consideration should be given to the inclusion of nutrition experts to guide nurse educators to develop and implement innovative nutrition care programmes.

AB  - The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro) from SARS-CoV-2 play crucial roles in the viral life cycle and are considered the most promising targets for drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, FDA-approved drugs were screened to identify the probable anti-RdRp and 3CLpro inhibitors by molecular docking approach. The number of ligands selected from the PubChem database of NCBI for screening was 1760. Ligands were energy minimized using Open Babel. The RdRp and 3CLpro protein sequences were retrieved from the NCBI database. For Homology Modeling predictions, we used the Swiss model server. Their structure was then energetically minimized using SPDB viewer software and visualized in the CHIMERA UCSF software. Molecular dockings were performed using AutoDock Vina, and candidate drugs were selected based on binding affinity (∆G). Hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between ligands and proteins were visualized using Ligplot and the Discovery Studio Visualizer v3.0 software. Our results showed 58 drugs against RdRp, which had binding energy of − 8.5 or less, and 69 drugs to inhibit the 3CLpro enzyme with a binding energy of − 8.1 or less. Six drugs based on binding energy and number of hydrogen bonds were chosen for the next step of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate drug-protein interactions (including Nilotinib, Imatinib and dihydroergotamine for 3clpro and Lapatinib, Dexasone and Relategravir for RdRp). Except for Lapatinib, other drugs-complexes were stable during MD simulation. Raltegravir, an anti-HIV drug, was observed to be the best compound against RdRp based on docking binding energy (−9.5 kcal/mole) and MD results. According to the MD results and binding energy, dihydroergotamine is a suitable candidate for 3clpro inhibition (−9.6 kcal/mol). These drugs were classified into several categories, including antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, cardiovascular, anticoagulant, BPH and impotence, antipsychotic, antimigraine, anticancer, and so on. The common prescription-indications for some of these medication categories appeared somewhat in line with manifestations of COVID-19. We hope that they can be beneficial for patients with certain specific symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they can also probably inhibit viral enzymes. We recommend further experimental evaluations in vitro and in vivo on these FDA-approved drugs to assess their potential antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Respiratory viruses represent a severe public health risk worldwide, and the research contribution to tackle the current pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 is one of the main targets among the scientific community. In this regard, experts from different fields have gathered to confront this catastrophic pandemic. This review illustrates how nanotechnology intervention could be valuable in solving this difficult situation, and the state of the art of Zn-based nanostructures are discussed in detail. For virus detection, learning from the experience of other respiratory viruses such as influenza, the potential use of Zn nanomaterials as suitable sensing platforms to recognize the S1 spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 are shown. Furthermore, a discussion about the antiviral mechanisms reported for ZnO nanostructures is included, which can help develop surface disinfectants and protective coatings. At the same time, the properties of Zn-based materials as supplements for reducing viral activity and the recovery of infected patients are illustrated. Within the scope of noble adjuvants to improve the immune response, the ZnO NPs properties as immunomodulators are explained, and potential prototypes of nanoengineered particles with metallic cations (like Zn2+) are suggested. Therefore, using Zn-associated nanomaterials from detection to disinfection, supplementation, and immunomodulation opens a wide area of opportunities to combat these emerging respiratory viruses. Finally, the attractive properties of these nanomaterials can be extrapolated to new clinical challenges.

AB  - Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolic events, which have a considerable impact on morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of thrombotic events in patients with IBD. However, many unresolved questions remain, particularly regarding the mechanisms that determine the persistent inflammatory state independent of disease activity. This review explored the role of gut microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal barrier dysfunction, which are considered distinctive features of IBD, in determining pro-thrombotic tendencies. Gut-derived endotoxemia due to the translocation of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the intestine to the bloodstream and the bacterial metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are the most important molecules involved in gut dysbiosis-related thrombosis. The pathogenic prothrombotic pathways linked to LPS and TMAO have been discussed. Finally, we present emerging therapeutic approaches that can help reduce LPS-mediated endotoxemia and TMAO, such as restoring intestinal eubiosis, normalizing intestinal barrier function, and counterbalancing the effects of LPS and TMAO.

AB  - Severe pneumonia is one of the most common infectious diseases and the leading cause of sepsis and septic shock. Preventing infection, balancing the patient’s immune status, and anti-coagulation therapy are all important elements in the treatment of severe pneumonia. As multi-target agents, Xuebijing injection (XBJ) has shown unique advantages in targeting complex conditions and saving the lives of patients with severe pneumonia. This review outlines progress in the understanding of XBJ’s anti-inflammatory, endotoxin antagonism, and anticoagulation effects. From the hundreds of publications released over the past few years, the key results from representative clinical studies of XBJ in the treatment of severe pneumonia were selected and summarized. XBJ was observed to effectively suppress the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, counter the effects of endotoxin, and assert an anticoagulation effect in most clinical trials, which are consistent with experimental studies. Collectively, this evidence suggests that XBJ could play an important and expanding role in clinical medicine, especially for sepsis, septic shock and severe pneumonia.

AB  - Vascular research questions can be answered using various study designs. Observational studies are used frequently to address a wide range of clinical questions when randomized clinical trials are not feasible or practical. One of the powerful vascular research tools is the cohort study. The cohort study is a reliable observational study design in which individuals who share a common characteristic (a cohort) are followed over time and their outcomes are assessed at various intervals. This review focuses on the essential characteristics, design, implementation, bias, validity, and clinical significance of cohort studies and provides illustrative examples. A cohort study can be either a prospective or a retrospective study, depending on whether the outcome occurred before or after the enrollment of the cohort. Each type has its advantages and disadvantages. Confounding, selection, and information biases can all occur in cohort studies. Applications of the cohort study design include studying the natural history of a disease, describing a condition's frequency, and investigating multiple outcomes simultaneously.

AB  - Neutrophils are the primary host innate immune cells defending against pathogens. One proposed mechanism by which neutrophils limit pathogen transmission is NETosis, which includes releasing the nuclear content into the cytosol by forming pores in the plasma membrane. The extrusion of cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) results in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) composed of nuclear DNA associated with histones and granule proteins. NETosis is driven by the enzyme PAD-4 (Peptidylarginine deiminase-4), which converts arginine into citrulline, leading to decondensation of chromatin, separation of DNA, and eventual extrusion. DNase is responsible for the breakdown of NETs. On the one hand, the release of DNase may interfere with the antibacterial effects of NETs; further, DNase may protect tissues from self-destruction caused by the increased release of NET under septic conditions. NETs in physiological quantities are expected to have a role in anti-infectious innate immune responses. In contrast, abnormally high concentrations of NETs in the body that are not adequately cleared by DNases can damage tissues and cause inflammation. Through several novel approaches, it is now possible to avoid the adverse effects caused by the continued release of NETs into the extracellular environment. In this review we have highlighted the basic mechanisms of NETosis, its significance in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory disorders, and the role of DNase enzyme with a focus on the possible function of nanotechnology in its management.

For universal surgical, obstetric, trauma, and anesthesia care by 2030, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery (LCoGS) suggested tracking six indicators. We reviewed academic and policy literature to investigate the current state of LCoGS indicators in India. There was limited primary data for access to timely essential surgery, risk of impoverishing and catastrophic health expenditures due to surgery, though some modeled estimates are present. Surgical specialist workforce estimates are heterogeneous across different levels of care, urban and rural areas, and diverse health sectors. Surgical volumes differ widely across demographic, socio-economic, and geographic cohorts. Perioperative mortality rates vary across procedures, diagnoses, and follow-up time periods. Available data suggest India falls short of achieving global targets. This review highlights the evidence gap for India's surgical care planning. India needs a systematic subnational mapping of indicators and adaptation of targets as per the country's health needs for equitable and sustainable planning.

AB  - Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is currently the most frequent cause of acute flaccid paralysis on a global scale, being an autoimmune disorder wherein demyelination of the peripheral nerves occurs. Its main clinical features are a symmetrical ascending muscle weakness with reduced osteotendinous reflexes and variable sensory involvement. GBS most commonly occurs after an infection, especially viral (including COVID-19), but may also transpire after immunization with certain vaccines or in the development of specific malignancies. Immunoglobulins, plasmapheresis, and glucocorticoids represent the principal treatment modalities, however patients with severe disease progression may require supportive therapy in an intensive care unit. Due to its symptomology, which overlaps with numerous neurological and infectious illnesses, the diagnosis of GBS may often be misattributed to pathologies that are essentially different from this syndrome. Moreover, many of these require specific treatment methods distinct to those recommended for GBS, in lack of which the prognosis of the patient is drastically affected. Such diseases include exposure to toxins either environmental or foodborne, central nervous system infections, metabolic or serum ion alterations, demyelinating pathologies, or even conditions amenable to neurosurgical intervention. This extensive narrative review aims to systematically and comprehensively tackle the most notable and challenging differential diagnoses of GBS, emphasizing on the clinical discrepancies between the diseases, the appropriate paraclinical investigations, and suitable management indications.

AB  - With climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and ongoing conflicts, food systems and the diets they produce are facing increasing fragility. In a turbulent, hot world, threatened resiliency and sustainability of food systems could make it all the more complicated to nourish a population of 9.7 billion by 2050. Climate change is having adverse impacts across food systems with more frequent and intense extreme events that will challenge food production, storage, and transport, potentially imperiling the global population’s ability to access and afford healthy diets. Inadequate diets will contribute further to detrimental human and planetary health impacts. At the same time, the way food is grown, processed, packaged, and transported is having adverse impacts on the environment and finite natural resources further accelerating climate change, tropical deforestation, and biodiversity loss. This state-of-the-science iterative review covers three areas. The paper's first section presents how climate change is connected to food systems and how dietary trends and foods consumed worldwide impact human health, climate change, and environmental degradation. The second area articulates how food systems affect global dietary trends and the macro forces shaping food systems and diets. The last section highlights how specific food policies and actions related to dietary transitions can contribute to climate adaptation and mitigation responses and, at the same time, improve human and planetary health. While there is significant urgency in acting, it is also critical to move beyond the political inertia and bridge the separatism of food systems and climate change agendas that currently exists among governments and private sector actors. The window is closing and closing fast.

AB  - Biomathematics has become one of the most significant areas of research as a result of interdisciplinary study. Chronic diseases sometimes referred to as non-communicable and communicable diseases, are conditions that develop over an extended period as a result of different factors like genetics, lifestyle, and environment. The most important common types of disease are cardiovascular, alcohol, cancer, and diabetes. More than three-quarters of the world’s (31.4 million) deaths occur in low- and middle-income nations, which are disproportionately affected by different infections. Fractional Calculus is a prominent topic for research within the discipline of Applied Mathematics due to its usefulness in solving problems in many different branches of science, engineering, and medicine. Recent researchers have identified the importance of mathematical tools in various disease models as being very useful to study the dynamics with the help of fractional and integer calculus modeling. Due to the complexity of the underlying connections, both deterministic and stochastic epidemiological models are founded on an inadequate understanding of the infectious network. Over the past several years, the use of different fractional operators to model the problem has grown, and it is now a common way to study how epidemics spread. Recently, researchers have actively considered fractional calculus to study different diseases like COVID-19, cancer, TB, HIV, dengue fever, diabetes, cholera, pine welts, smoking and heart attacks, etc. With the help of fractional operator, we modified a mathematical model for the dynamical transmission, analysis, treatment, vaccination, and precaution leveling necessary to mitigate the negative impact of illness on society in the long run, overcoming the memory effect without defining or considering others parameters. In this review paper, we considered all the recent studies based on the fractional modeling of infectious and non-infectious diseases with different fractional operators such as Caputo, Caputo Fabrizio, ABC, and constant proportional with Caputo, etc. This review paper aims to bring all the information together by considering different fractional operators and their uses in the field of infectious disease modeling. The steps taken to accomplish the goal were developing a mathematical model, identifying the equilibrium point, figuring out the minimal reproductive number, and assessing the stability around the equilibrium point. For future direction, we consider the cancer model to study the growth cells of cancer and the impact of therapy to control infections. An equilibrium solution and an analysis of the behavior dynamics of the cell spread with treatment in the form of chemotherapy were obtained. The simulation shows that the population of cancer cells is influenced by the pace of cancer cell growth with the Caputo fractional derivative. The acquired results show how effective and precise the suggested approach is in helping to better understand how chemotherapy works. Chemotherapy medications have been found to increase immunity against particular cancer by reducing the number of tumor cells. Further, we suggested some future work directions with the help of the new hybrid fractional operator. Our innovative methodology might have significant effects on global stakeholders, policymakers, and national health systems. The current strategies for controlling outbreaks and the vaccination and prevention policies that have been implemented would benefit from a more accurate representation of the dynamics of contagious diseases, which necessitates the development of highly complex mathematical models. Microorganisms, interactions between individuals or groups, and environmental, social, economic, and demographic factors on a broader scale are all examples.

AB  - Background
The impact of concurrent upper limb and fragility hip fractures has not been well defined. A greater understanding of this can guide decision making in the early peri-operative period and subsequent rehabilitation of such patients.
Aims
To identify if patients with concurrent upper limb and fragility hip fractures have different outcomes and demographics than those with an isolated hip fracture.
Methods
A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify cohort and case-control studies, comparing concurrent hip and upper limb fractures with isolated hip fractures. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4. Subgroup analyses were performed for concurrent distal radius and concurrent proximal humerus fractures.
Results
13 studies were included reporting on 196,916 patients with an isolated hip fracture and 13,373 with concurrent hip and upper limb fractures. Patients with concurrent upper limb fractures had a significantly longer length of hospital stay (mean difference: 3.97 days, 95% CI: 1.36, 6.57, P=0.003) as compared to those with isolated hip fractures. Patients with concurrent upper limb fractures were significantly more likely to be female (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.70, P<0.00001), reside at home pre-injury (OR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.37, 0.96, P=0.03) and have no cognitive impairment (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.84, P=0.006). Patients with concurrent distal radius fractures had significantly lower 90-day mortality (OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.99, P=0.04) and 1-year mortality (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.90, P=0.008).
Conclusions
Concurrent fragility hip and upper limb fractures are associated with increased length of hospital stay. We recommend early, aggressive, individualised rehabilitation to help improve outcomes and early hospital discharge in this highly vulnerable patient group.

AB  - Among the various emerging contaminants, pharmaceuticals (PhACs) seem to have adverse effects on the quality of water. Even the smallest concentration of PhACs in ground water and drinking water is harmful to humans and aquatic species. Among all the deaths reported due to COVID-19, the mortality rate was higher for those patients who consumed antibiotics. Consequently, PhAC in water is a serious concern and their removal needs immediate attention. This study has focused on the PhACs' degradation by collaborating photocatalysis with membrane filtration. TiO2-based photocatalytic membrane is an innovative strategy which demonstrates mineralization of PhACs as a safer option. To highlight the same, an emphasis on the preparation and reinforcing properties of TiO2-based nanomembranes has been elaborated in this review. Further, mineralization of antibiotics or cytostatic compounds and their degradation mechanisms is also highlighted using TiO2 assisted membrane photocatalysis. Experimental reactor configurations have been discussed for commercial implementation of photoreactors for PhAC degradation anchored photocatalytic nanomembranes. Challenges and future perspectives are emphasized in order to design a nanomembrane based prototype in future for wastewater management.
