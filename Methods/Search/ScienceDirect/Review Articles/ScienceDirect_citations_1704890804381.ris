AB  - COVID-19-infected individuals and those who recovered from the infection have been demonstrated to have elevated liver enzymes or abnormal liver biochemistries, particularly with preexisting liver diseases, liver metabolic disorders, viral hepatitis, and other hepatic comorbidities. However, possible crosstalk and intricate interplay between COVID-19 and liver disease severity are still elusive, and the available data are murky and confined. Similarly, the syndemic of other blood-borne infectious diseases, chemical-induced liver injuries, and chronic hepatic diseases continued to take lives while showing signs of worsening due to the COVID-19 crisis. Moreover, the pandemic is not over yet and is transitioning to becoming an epidemic in recent years; hence, monitoring liver function tests (LFTs) and assessing hepatic consequences of COVID-19 in patients with or without liver illnesses would be of paramount interest. This pragmatic review explores the correlations between COVID-19 and liver disease severity based on abnormal liver biochemistries and other possible mechanisms in individuals of all ages from the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic to the post-pandemic period. The review also alludes to clinical perspectives of such interactions to curb overlapping hepatic diseases in people who recovered from the infection or living with long COVID-19.

AB  - The destructive effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the elderly and people with cardiovascular disease have been proven. New findings shed light on the role of aging pathways on life span and health age. New therapies that focus on aging-related pathways may positively impact the treatment of this acute respiratory infection. Using new therapies that boost the level of the immune system can support the elderly with co-morbidities against the acute form of COVID-19. This article discusses the effect of the aging immune system against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the pathways affecting this severity of infection.

Cardiac manifestations in COVID-19 can be due to direct damage to the myocardium and conduction system as well as by the disease's effect on the various organ systems. These manifestations include acute coronary syndrome, ST- segment elevations, cardiomyopathy, and dysrhythmias. Some of these dysrhythmias can be detrimental to the patient. Therefore, it is important for the emergency physician to be aware of the different arrhythmias associated with COVID-19 and how to manage them. This narrative review discusses the pathophysiology underlying the various arrhythmias associated with COVID-19 and their management considerations.

AB  - The antioxidant effects of selenium as a component of selenoproteins has been thought to modulate host immunity and viral pathogenesis. Accordingly, the association of low dietary selenium status with inflammatory and immunodeficiency has been reported in the literature; however, the causal role of selenium deficiency in chronic inflammatory diseases and viral infection is still undefined. The COVID-19, characterized by acute respiratory syndrome and caused by the novel coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, has infected millions of individuals worldwide since late 2019. The severity and mortality from COVID-19 have been associated with several factor, including age, sex and selenium deficiency. However, available data on selenium status and COVID-19 are limited, and a possible causative role for selenium deficiency in COVID-19 severity has yet to be fully addressed. In this context, we review the relationship between selenium, selenoproteins, COVID-19, immune and inflammatory responses, viral infection, and aging. Regardless of the role of selenium in immune and inflammatory responses, we emphasize that selenium supplementation should be indicated after a selenium deficiency be detected, particularly, in view of the critical role played by selenoproteins in human health. In addition, the levels of selenium should be monitored after the start of supplementation and discontinued as soon as normal levels are reached. Periodic assessment of selenium levels after supplementation is a critical issue to avoid over production of toxic metabolites of selenide because under normal conditions, selenoproteins attain saturated expression levels that limits their potential deleterious metabolic effects.

AB  - Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the male sex is a significant risk factor for severe disease and mortality due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the precise explanation for the discrepancy is currently unclear. Immunologically, the female-biased protection against COVID-19 could presumably be due to a more rapid and robust immune response to viruses exhibited by males. The female hormones, e.g., estrogens and progesterone, may have protective roles against viral infections. In contrast, male hormones, e.g., testosterone, can act oppositely. Besides, the expression of the ACE-2 receptor in the lung and airway lining, which the SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter cells, is more pronounced in males. Estrogen potentially plays a role in downregulating the expression of ACE-2, which could be a plausible biological explanation for the reduced severity of COVID-19 in females. Comorbidities, e.g., cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and kidney disorders, are considered significant risk factors for severe outcomes in COVID-19. Age-adjusted data shows that males are statistically more predisposed to these morbidities—amplifying risks for males with COVID-19. In addition, many sociocultural factors and gender-constructed behavior of men and women impact exposure to infections and outcomes. In many parts of the world, women are more likely to abide by health regulations, e.g., mask-wearing and handwashing, than men. In contrast, men, in general, are more involved with high-risk behaviors, e.g., smoking and alcohol consumption, and high-risk jobs that require admixing with people, which increases their risk of exposure to the infection. Overall, males and females suffer differently from COVID-19 due to a complex interplay between many biological and sociocultural factors.

AB  - Background and aims
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the current evidence available to investigate clinical outcomes between patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Methods
MEDLINE (Pubmed), Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane library, Google scholar and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized trials, and observational studies were eligible for inclusion. National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool was used to assess the quality. Data were pooled by the Restricted-maximum-likelihood random-effects approach.
Results
Total 11 studies comprising 7690415 individuals were included in this study. The log OR for the pooled data for all-cause mortality rate was −0.71 (95% CI: −1.38 to −0.03). Based on the pooled results, type 1 diabetic COVID-19 patients may have a better prognosis for mortality. There were no significant differences between groups in term of ICU-admission log OR -0.22 (95% CI: −0.81 to 0.37), and hospitalization log OR -0.48 (95% CI: −1.23 to 0.27). Based on our descriptives analyses after adjusting for age and comorbidities, the high-risk group in three studies was type 2 diabetes, and in five studies was type 1. Two studies reported no significant difference between these groups in relevant outcomes.
Conclusion
There were no significant differences in disease severity between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Based on the unadjusted data available, the mortality rate for people with type 1 diabetes was shown to be lower than that for people with type 2. As data on these subjects is scarce, and the results obtained from studies are heterogeneous, further research with adequate sample sizes is needed to precisely compare the outcomes of COVID-19 between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Mortality statistics are fundamental to understand the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to limitation of real-time data availability, researchers had used mathematical models to estimate excess mortality globally during COVID-19 pandemic. As they demonstrated variations in scope, assumptions, estimations, and magnitude of the pandemic, and hence raised a controversy all over the world. This paper aims to review the mathematical models and their estimates of mortality due to COVID-19 in the Indian context. The PRISMA and SWiM guidelines were followed to the best possible extent. A twostep search strategy was used to identify studies that estimated excess deaths from January 2020 to December 2021 on Medline, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv available until 0100 h, 16 May 2022 (IST).We selected 13 studies based on a predefined criteria and extracted data on a standardised, pre-piloted form by two investigators, independently. Any discordance was resolved through consensus with a senior investigator. Estimated excess mortality was analysed using statistical software and depicted using appropriate graphs. Significant variations in scope, population, data sources, time period, and modelling strategies existed across studies along with a high risk of bias. Most of the models were based on Poisson regression. Predicted excess mortality by various models ranged from 1.1 to 9.5 million. The review presents a summary of all the estimates of excess deaths and is important to understand the different strategies used for estimation, and it highlights the importance of data availability, assumptions, and estimates.

AB  - Deficiency of selenium (Se) has been described in a significant number of COVID-19 patients having a higher incidence of mortality, which makes it a pertinent issue to be addressed clinically for effective management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Se nanoparticles (SeNPs) provide a unique option for managing the havoc caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. SeNPs possess promising anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects by virtue of their nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-stimulator of activated B cells (NFκB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) modulatory activity. In addition, SeNPs possess remarkable immunomodulatory effects, making them a suitable option for supplementation with a much lower risk of toxicity compared to their elemental counterpart. Further, SeNPs have been shown to curtail viral and microbial infections, thus, making it a novel means to halt viral growth. In addition, it can be administered in the form of aerosol spray, direct injection, or infused thin-film transdermal patches to reduce the spread of this highly contagious viral infection. Moreover, a considerable decrease in the expression of selenoprotein along with enhanced expression of IL-6 in COVID-19 suggests a potential association among selenoprotein expression and COVID-19. In this review, we highlight the unique antimicrobial and antiviral properties of SeNPs and the immunomodulatory potential of selenoproteins. We provide the rationale behind their potentially interesting properties and further exploration in the context of microbial and viral infections. Further, the importance of selenoproteins and their role in maintaining a successful immune response along with their association to Se status is summarized.

Objective
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic. This systematic review compares mortality risk factors including clinical, demographic and laboratory features of COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The aim is to provide new strategies for COVID-19 prevention and treatment.
Methods
We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis, using five databases to compare the predictors of death for COVID-19, SARS and MERS. A random-effects model meta-analysis calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
Results
845 articles up through 11/4/2020 were retrieved, but only 28 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that males had a higher likelihood of death than females (OR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.56–2.13). Age (OR = 7.86, 95% CI 5.46–11.29), diabetes comorbidity (OR = 3.73, 95% CI 2.35–5.90), chronic lung disease (OR = 3.43, 95% CI 1.80–6.52) and hypertension (OR = 3.38, 95% CI 2.45–4.67) were the mortality risk factors. The laboratory indicators lactic dehydrogenase (OR = 37.52, 95% CI 24.68–57.03), C-reactive protein (OR = 12.11, 95% CI 5.24–27.98), and neutrophils (OR = 17.56, 95% CI 10.67–28.90) had stronger correlations with COVID-19 mortality than with SARS or MERS mortality. Consolidation and ground-glass opacity imaging features were similar among COVID-19, SARS, and MERS patients.
Conclusions
COVID-19′s mortality factors are similar to those of SARS and MERS. Age and laboratory indicators could be effective predictors of COVID-19 mortality outcomes.

AB  - Obesity is strongly and independently associated with an increased risk of severe illness and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The pathophysiological changes that result from elevated body weight lead to metabolic dysfunction, chronic inflammation, impaired immunological responses, and multisystem disorders, which increase vulnerability to severe illness from COVID-19. While vaccination strategies are under way across the world, the second and third waves of the pandemic, along with the emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strains, continue to threaten the stability of medical systems worldwide. Furthermore, evidence from previous pandemics suggests that vaccines are less effective in obese individuals than in their healthy-weight counterparts over the long term. Therefore, a consideration of lifestyle changes that can boost metabolic health and immunity is critical to reduce the risk of complications and severe illness from viral infection. In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms linking excess body weight with COVID-19 morbidity. We also present evidence that intermittent fasting (IF), a dietary program that has gained popularity in recent years, may be an effective strategy to improve metabolic health and immunity and thus reduce the impact of obesity on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Objectives
To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the relative risk of COVID-19-related mortality among people with disabilities compared to people without disabilities.
Study design
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods
We systematically searched four databases from March 1, 2020, to August 15, 2022. We included prospective studies with a baseline assessment of disability and a longitudinal assessment of the COVID-19-related mortality. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook random-effects meta-analyses to calculate pooled adjusted hazard ratios for COVID-19-related mortality for people with disabilities, also disaggregated by disability type and study setting.
Results
We identified 2596 articles throughout the electronic data search, and 56 studies were included in the review. Most (73%) had a moderate risk of bias. The pooled adjusted effect estimate for COVID-19-related mortality in people with disabilities compared to those without was 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4–3.2). Heterogeneity between the studies was high (τ2 = 0.28, I2 = 97%). Effect estimates were highest for population-based samples (3.3, 95% CI: 2.7–3.9), compared to hospital settings (2.1, 95% CI: 1.7–2.7). Risk was not elevated among people with disabilities in care home settings (1.6, 95% CI: 0.7–3.5). Disaggregation by disability type showed that people with intellectual disabilities were at the highest relative risk of COVID-19 mortality.
Discussion
Risk of COVID-19 mortality is elevated among people with disabilities, especially people with intellectual disabilities. Efforts are needed to collect better routine data on disability and to include people with disabilities in the pandemic response for COVID-19.

AB  - COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged as a global health threat in 2019. An important feature of the disease is that multiorgan symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection persist after recovery. Evidence indicates that people who recovered from COVID-19, even those under the age of 65 years without cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes, had a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease for up to one year after diagnosis. Therefore, it is important to closely monitor individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 for potential cardiovascular damage that may manifest at a later stage. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death characterized by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased lipid peroxide levels. Several studies have demonstrated that ferroptosis plays an important role in cancer, ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/RI), and other cardiovascular diseases. Altered iron metabolism, upregulation of reactive oxygen species, and glutathione peroxidase 4 inactivation are striking features of COVID-19-related cardiovascular injury. SARS-CoV-2 can cause cardiovascular ferroptosis, leading to cardiovascular damage. Understanding the mechanism of ferroptosis in COVID-19-related cardiovascular injuries will contribute to the development of treatment regimens for preventing or reducing COVID-19-related cardiovascular complications. In this article, we go over the pathophysiological underpinnings of SARS-CoV-2-induced acute and chronic cardiovascular injury, the function of ferroptosis, and prospective treatment approaches.

AB  - Background
Elderly patients represent a high-risk group with increased risk of death from COVID-19. Despite the number of published studies, several unmet needs in care for older adults exist.
Objectives
To discuss unmet needs of COVID-19 in this special population.
Sources
A literature review for studies on COVID-19 in elderly patients published between December 2019 and November 2021 was performed. Clinical questions were formulated to guide the literature search. The search was conducted in the MEDLINE database, combining specific search terms. Two reviewers independently conducted the search and selected the studies according to the prespecified clinical questions.
Content
Elderly patients with COVID-19 have peculiar characteristics. They may have atypical clinical presentation, with no fever and with delirium or neurological manifestations as the most common signs, with potential delayed diagnosis and increased risk of death. The reported fatality rates among elderly patients with COVID-19 are extremely high. Several factors, including comorbidities, atypical presentation, and exclusion from intensive care unit care, contribute to this excess of mortality. Age alone is frequently used as a key factor to exclude the elderly from intensive care, but there is evidence that frailty rather than age better predicts the risk of poor outcome in this category. Durability of vaccine efficacy in the elderly remains debated, and the need for a third booster dose is becoming increasingly evident. Finally, efforts to care for elderly patients who have survived after acute COVID-19 should be implemented, considering the high rates of long COVID sequelae and the risk of longitudinal functional and cognitive decline.
Implications
We highlight peculiar aspects of COVID-19 in elderly patients and factors contributing to high risk of poor outcome in this category. We also illuminated gaps in current evidence, suggesting future research directions and underlining the need for further studies on the optimal management of elderly patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Background
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Although general and local public health report deathly cases, case fatality rates are still largely unknown. Thus, we sought to evaluate the mortality of COVID-19.
Methods
We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for articles evaluating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients that included clinical outcomes, between December 2020 and 24 April 2020. Two authors performed an independent selection using predefined terms of search.
Results
We retrieved 33 studies with a total of 13,398 patients with COVID-19 diagnosis. The mortality rate of the COVID‐19 patients was 17.1% (95% CI 12.7; 22.7, I2 = 96.9%). For general patients admitted to the hospital (excluding critical care-only studies) the mortality rate of the COVID‐19 was 11.5% (95% CI 7.7; 16.9, I2 = 96.7%). Among critical illness studies (n = 7) we found a 40.5% mortality (95% CI 31.2; 50.6, I2 = 91.8%).
Conclusion
High COVID-19 mortality among general admitted patients and critical care cases should guide resources allocations and economic burden calculations during the pandemics.

AB  - The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic influenced the management of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. A paucity of data exists on outcome of patients with vasculitis following COVID-19, but mortality is higher than in the general population and comparable to patients undergoing haemodialysis or kidney transplant recipients (reported mortality rates of 20–25%). Delays in diagnosis have been reported, which are associated with sequelae such as dialysis-dependency. Management of ANCA-associated vasculitis has not changed with the aim to suppress disease activity and reduce burden of disease. The use of rituximab, an important and widely used agent, is associated with a more severe hospital course of COVID-19 and absence of antibodies following severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 infections, which prone patients to re-infection. Reports on vaccine antibody response are scarce at the moment, but preliminary findings point towards an impaired immune response, especially when patients receive rituximab as part of their treatment. Seropositivity was reported in less than 20% of patients when rituximab was administered within the prior six months, and the antibody response correlated with CD19+ B-cell repopulation. A delay in maintenance doses, if disease activity allows, has been suggested using a CD19+ B-cell guided strategy. Other immunosuppressive measures, which are used in ANCA-associated vasculitis, also impair humoral and cellular vaccine responses. Regular measurements of vaccine response or a healthcare-policy time-based strategy are indicated to provide additional doses (“booster”) of COVID-19 vaccines. This review summarizes a recent educational forum and a recent virtual meeting of the European Vasculitis Society (EUVAS) focusing on COVID-19.

AB  - Background
Air pollution is speculated to increase the risks of COVID-19 spread, severity, and mortality.
Objectives
We systematically reviewed studies investigating the relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 cases, non-fatal severity, and mortality in North America and Europe.
Methods
We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies investigating the effects of harmful pollutants, including particulate matter with diameter ≤2.5 or 10 μm (PM2.5 or PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO), on COVID-19 cases, severity, and deaths in Europe and North America through to June 19, 2021. Articles were included if they quantitatively measured the relationship between exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes.
Results
From 2,482 articles screened, we included 116 studies reporting 355 separate pollutant-COVID-19 estimates. Approximately half of all evaluations on incidence were positive and significant associations (52.7%); for mortality the corresponding figure was similar (48.1%), while for non-fatal severity this figure was lower (41.2%). Longer-term exposure to pollutants appeared more likely to be positively associated with COVID-19 incidence (63.8%). PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, and CO were most strongly positively associated with COVID-19 incidence, while PM2.5 and NO2 with COVID-19 deaths. All studies were observational and most exhibited high risk of confounding and outcome measurement bias.
Discussion
Air pollution may be associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Future research is needed to better test the air pollution-COVID-19 hypothesis, particularly using more robust study designs and COVID-19 measures that are less prone to measurement error and by considering co-pollutant interactions.

AB  - Heart Failure (HF) is a common comorbidity in the United state. COVID-19 infection has shown worse clinical outcomes among heart failure patients; however, there is limited evidence on the impact of COVID-19 infection on the subset of HF. Hence, we aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection without HF vs concomitant COVID-19 infection with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (AD-HFpEF) vs concomitant COVID-19 Infection with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (AD-HFrEF) using a large dataset illustrating a real word analysis. A retrospective study design of hospitalizations using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database registry 2020 with a principal diagnosis of adult patients (≥18 years) hospitalized with COVID-19 infection as principal diagnosis using ICD-10 codes stratified to COVID-19 infection without HF vs COVID-19 infection with AD-HFpEF vs COVID-19 infection with AD-HFrEF. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Multivariate logistic, linear, poisson, and Cox regression models were used for analysis. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 1,050,045 COVID-19 infection cases were included in this study, out of which 1,007,860 (98.98%) had only COVID-19 infection without HF, while 20,550 (1.96%) had COVID-19 infection with Acute Decompensated HFpEF, and 21,675 (2.06%) had COVID-19 infection with Acute Decompensated HFrEF. Our study shows that patients with COVID-19 infection and AD-HFrEF had the highest in-hospital mortality rate (25.4%). Using COVID-19 infection without HF with a mortality of 10.6% as a reference, COVID-19 infection with AD-HFpEF with a 22.5% mortality rate (95% CI 2.3-2.6, aOR; 2.4) and COVID-19 infection with AD-HFrEF with 25.4% mortality rate (95% CI 2.7-3.1, aOR; 2.9). Acute Decompensated HF with concurrent COVID-19 infection is associated with higher in-hospital mortality, with higher in-hospital mortality outcome observed among COVID 19 infection with concurrent AD-HFrEF.

AB  - Cardiometabolic diseases and abnormalities have recently emerged as independent risk factors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, including hospitalizations, invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Determining whether and how this observation translates to more effective long-term pandemic mitigation strategies remains a challenge due to key research gaps. Specific pathways by which cardiometabolic pathophysiology affects humoral immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and vice versa, remain unclear. This review summarizes current evidence of the bidirectional influences between cardiometabolic diseases (diabetes, adiposity, hypertension, CVDs) and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies induced from infection and vaccination based on human studies. Ninety-two studies among >408,000 participants in 37 countries on 5 continents (Europe, Asia, Africa, and North and South America) were included in this review. Obesity was associated with higher neutralizing antibody titers following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most studies conducted prior to vaccinations found positive or null associations between binding antibodies (levels, seropositivity) and diabetes; after vaccinations, antibody responses did not differ by diabetes. Hypertension and CVDs were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Findings underscore the importance of elucidating the extent that tailored recommendations for COVID-19 prevention, vaccination effectiveness, screening, and diagnoses among people with obesity could reduce disease burden caused by SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Summary
In April, 2020, just months into the COVID-19 pandemic, an international group of public health researchers published three lessons learned from the HIV pandemic for the response to COVID-19, which were to: anticipate health inequalities, create an enabling environment to support behavioural change, and engage a multidisciplinary effort. We revisit these lessons in light of more than 2 years’ experience with the COVID-19 pandemic. With specific examples, we detail how inequalities have played out within and between countries, highlight factors that support or impede the creation of enabling environments, and note ongoing issues with the scarcity of integrated science and health system approaches. We argue that to better apply lessons learned as the COVID-19 pandemic matures and other infectious disease outbreaks emerge, it will be imperative to create dialogue among polarised perspectives, identify shared priorities, and draw on multidisciplinary evidence.

AB  - The presentation and management of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection in the obstetric population is affected by the hormonal and mechanical changes of pregnancy. The increased oxygen demands in pregnancy in the face of conventional oxygen therapy, risks of tracheal intubation and discomfort from non-invasive positive pressure ventilation all support the use of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) as an alternative therapy. The lack of published guidance for the use of HFNO has led to the development of local-level guidance based on expert consensus. More evidence exploring the use of HFNO therapy in the pregnant population is required to assist in developing clinical guidelines.

AB  - Several COVID-19 patients frequently experience with happy hypoxia. Sometimes, the level of nitric oxide (NO) in COVID-19 patients was found to be greater than in non-COVID-19 hypoxemics and most of the cases lower. Induced or inhaled NO has a long history of usage as a therapy for hypoxemia. Excessive production of ROS and oxidative stress lower the NO level and stimulates mitochondrial malfunction is the primary cause of hypoxia-mediated mortality in COVID-19. Higher level of NO in mitochondria also the cause of dysfunction, because, excess NO can also diffuse quickly into mitochondria or through mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase (NOS). A precise dose of NO may increase oxygenation while also acting as an effective inhibitor of cytokine storm. NOS inhibitors may be used in conjunction with iNO therapy to compensate for the patient's optimal NO level. NO play a key role in COVID-19 happy hypoxia and a crucial component in the COVID-19 pathogenesis that demands a reliable and easily accessible biomarker to monitor.

To examine the impact of COVID-19 on clinical health outcomes and health-related social needs among Medicaid-Medicare dual-eligible beneficiaries.
Design
Scoping review.
Setting and Participants
Dual eligibles during COVID-19.
Methods
We performed a comprehensive scoping review including observational studies, clinical trials, and original empirical research studies of PubMed and CINAHL. We generated a list of terms related to programs that both serve dual eligibles and address our desired outcomes. With the assistance of a medical librarian, we identified relevant abstracts published during COVID-19 meeting our inclusion criteria. We performed full-text reviews of relevant abstracts and selected the final studies. We extracted the study population, design, and major findings, then conducted thematic analysis.
Results
1100 articles were identified, with 439 deemed relevant. On full text-review, 15 articles met inclusion criteria representing more than 86 million Medicare beneficiaries. No studies were specific only to dual eligibles. Topic areas included in this review include COVID-19 case counts (2 articles), mortality (8 articles), hospitalizations (7 articles), food insecurity (1 article), self-reported mental health (1 article), and social connectedness (2 articles). Dual eligibles had disparate COVID-19–related outcomes from Medicare-only enrollees in 12 of 15 studies. Studies show higher mortality for dual eligibles overall, but this was not true for dual eligibles in nursing homes and assisted living communities. Dual eligibles were more likely to experience food insecurity. More favorably, dual eligibles reported greater social connectedness.
Conclusions and Implications
Dual eligibles had different outcomes from Medicare-only recipients in multiple health outcomes and health-related social needs during COVID-19, but studies are limited, particularly in terms of health-related social needs. Future work focusing on outcomes only among dual-eligible beneficiaries, integrated care programs, and fiscal alignment between Medicare and Medicaid plans may help stakeholders address health needs specific to dual eligibles.

AB  - Summary
Singapore developed several novel strategies to transition towards "living with COVID-19", while protecting hospital capacity. The Home Recovery Programme (HRP) was a national, centrally-administered programme that leveraged technology and telemedicine to allow low-risk individuals to safely recover at home. The HRP was subsequently expanded by partnering primary care doctors in caring for more cases in the community. A key enabler was the National Sorting Logic (NSL), a multi-step triage algorithm allowing risk-stratification of large numbers of COVID-19 patients at a national-level. At the core of the NSL was a risk assessment criterion, comprising of Comorbidities-of-concern, Age, Vaccination status, Examination/clinical findings and Symptoms (CAVES). The NSL sorted all COVID-19 cases into the various levels of care – Primary Care, HRP, COVID-19 Treatment Facility and Hospital. By adopting a national approach towards managing healthcare capacities and triaging COVID-19 patients, Singapore was able to prioritize healthcare resources for high-risk individuals and prevent hospital capacities from being overwhelmed. As part of the national response strategy to tackle COVID-19, Singapore set up and integrated key national databases to enable responsive data analysis and support evidence-based policy decisions. Using data collected between 30 August 2021 to 8 June 2022, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the outcomes and effectiveness of vaccination policies, NSL and home-based recovery. A total of 1,240,183 COVID-19 cases were diagnosed during this period, spanning both Delta and Omicron waves, Overall, Singapore experienced very low severity (0.51%) and mortality (0.11%) rates. Vaccinations significantly lowered severity and mortality risks across all age groups. The NSL was effective in predicting risk of severe outcomes and was able to right-site >93% of cases into home-based recovery. By leveraging high vaccination rates, technology and telemedicine, Singapore was able to safely navigate through two COVID-19 waves without impacting severity/mortality rates nor overwhelming hospital capacities.

AB  - A major immunopathological feature of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is excessive inflammation in the form of “cytokine storm”. The storm is characterized by injurious levels of cytokines which form a complicated network damaging different organs, including the lungs and the brain. The main starter of “cytokine network” hyperactivation in COVID-19 has not been discovered yet. Neuropilins (NRPs) are transmembrane proteins that act as neuronal guidance and angiogenesis modulators. The crucial function of NRPs in forming the nervous and vascular systems has been well-studied. NRP1 and NRP2 are the two identified homologs of NRP. NRP1 has been shown as a viral entry pathway for SARS-CoV2, which facilitates neuroinvasion by the virus within the central or peripheral nervous systems. These molecules directly interact with various COVID-19-related molecules, such as specific regions of the spike protein (major immune element of SARS-CoV2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, VEGFR1/2, and ANGPTL4 (regulator of vessel permeability and integrity). NRPs mainly play a role in hyperinflammatory injury of the CNS and lungs, and also the liver, kidney, pancreas, and heart in COVID-19 patients. New findings have suggested NRPs good candidates for pharmacotherapy of COVID-19. However, therapeutic targeting of NRP1 in COVID-19 is still in the preclinical phase. This review presents the implications of NRP1 in multi-organ inflammation-induced injury by SARS-CoV2 and provides insights for NRP1-targeting treatments for COVID-19 patients.

AB  - With mortality rising from the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be overlooking a key aspect of the immunological response. Fever is a cardinal sign of this rampant infection; however, little attention has been paid towards how a fever may work in our favor in overcoming this disease. Three key aspects of patient care – fever, fluid, and food – can be harmonized to overcome COVID-19 infection. Both animal and human studies have demonstrated that fever suppression during viral infections, either through low ambient temperatures or antipyretic use, may increase morbidity and prolong the illness. As fever rises, so do antidiuretic hormone levels, leading to solute-free water retention – making conservative fluid management essential. Finally, fever inhibits gastrointestinal function as energy is reallocated to the immunological response, underscoring the need to work in concert with these physiological changes. An opportunity awaits to investigate this natural barrier to infection, let us not pass it by.

AB  - Obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension (HTN), and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) often cluster together as “Cardiometabolic Disease” (CMD). Just under 50% of patients with CMD increased the risk of morbidity and mortality right from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as it has been reported in most countries affected by the SARS-CoV2 virus. One of the pathophysiological hallmarks of COVID-19 is the overactivation of the immune system with a prominent IL-6 response, resulting in severe and systemic damage involving also cytokines such as IL2, IL4, IL8, IL10, and interferon-gamma were considered strong predictors of COVID-19 severity. Thus, in this mini-review, we try to describe the inflammatory state, the alteration of the adipokine profile, and cytokine production in the obese state of infected and not infected patients by SARS-CoV2 with the final aim to find possible influences of COVID-19 on CMD and CVD. The immunological-based discussion of the molecular processes could inspire the study of promising targets for managing CMD patients and its complications during COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected certain groups, such as older people (ie, >65 years), minority ethnic populations, and people with specific chronic conditions including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and some respiratory diseases. There is now evidence of not only direct but also indirect adverse effects of COVID-19 in people with diabetes. Recurrent lockdowns and public health measures throughout the pandemic have restricted access to routine diabetes care, limiting new diagnoses, and affecting self-management, routine follow-ups, and access to medications, as well as affecting lifestyle behaviours and emotional wellbeing globally. Pre-pandemic studies have shown that short-term delays in delivery of routine care, even by 12 months, are associated with adverse effects on risk factor control and worse microvascular, macrovascular, and mortality outcomes in people with diabetes. Disruptions within the short-to-medium term due to natural disasters also result in worse diabetes outcomes. However, the true magnitude of the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term outcomes and mortality in people with diabetes is still unclear. Disasters tend to exacerbate existing health disparities; as we recover ambulatory diabetes services in the aftermath of the pandemic, there is an opportunity to prioritise those with the greatest need, and to target resources and interventions aimed at improving outcomes and reducing inequality.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic created a multitude of medical crossroads requiring real time adaptations of best practice covering preventative and interventional aspects of care. Among the many discoveries borne from efforts to address the myriad clinical presentations across multiple organ systems was a common impact on tissues with cells that express the ACE-2 receptor. The vast majority of acute infections began and often ended in the respiratory tract, but more recent evaluations have confirmed significant extrapulmonary manifestations including symptom clusters that extend beyond the acute phase of infection collectively referred to as “post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 infection” (PASC) or more commonly as “long (-haul) COVID”. Both acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC are associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis and alterations in the gut-brain and HPA-axis in a subset of the infected. Mounting evidence suggests these extrapulmonary manifestations may ultimately lead to reduced growth hormone (GH) secretion as demonstrated following stimulation tests. Disrupted GH secretion could cause or exacerbate long lasting neuropsychological symptoms as seen in other similar manifesting conditions. Ongoing clinical research has shown promising improvement in PASC patients with fatigue and cognition complaints can be achieved via GH replacement therapy. GH stimulation testing should be considered in PASC workups and future research should delve deeper into the mechanistic effects of GH on acute COVID and PASC.

AB  - Background
It is evident that COVID-19 will remain a public health concern in the coming years, largely driven by variants of concern (VOC). It is critical to continuously monitor vaccine effectiveness as new variants emerge and new vaccines and/or boosters are developed. Systematic surveillance of the scientific evidence base is necessary to inform public health action and identify key uncertainties. Evidence syntheses may also be used to populate models to fill in research gaps and help to prepare for future public health crises. This protocol outlines the rationale and methods for a living evidence synthesis of the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with, and transmission of, VOC of SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
Living evidence syntheses of vaccine effectiveness will be carried out over one year for (1) a range of potential outcomes in the index individual associated with VOC (pathogenesis); and (2) transmission of VOC. The literature search will be conducted up to May 2023. Observational and database-linkage primary studies will be included, as well as RCTs. Information sources include electronic databases (MEDLINE; Embase; Cochrane, L*OVE; the CNKI and Wangfang platforms), pre-print servers (medRxiv, BiorXiv), and online repositories of grey literature. Title and abstract and full-text screening will be performed by two reviewers using a liberal accelerated method. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be completed by one reviewer with verification of the assessment by a second reviewer. Results from included studies will be pooled via random effects meta-analysis when appropriate, or otherwise summarized narratively.
Discussion
Evidence generated from our living evidence synthesis will be used to inform policy making, modelling, and prioritization of future research on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against VOC.

AB  - Objectives
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with meta-regression of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), a biomarker of myocardial injury, in COVID-19 patients.
Methods
We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, for studies published between January 2020 and January 2021 that reported CK-MB, COVID-19 severity and mortality (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021239657).
Results
Fifty-five studies in 11,791 COVID-19 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that CK-MB concentrations were significantly higher in patients with high disease severity or non-survivor status than patients with low severity or survivor status (standardized mean difference, SMD, 0.81, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.01, p<0.001). The rate of patients with CK-MB values above the normal range was also significantly higher in the former than the latter (60/350 vs 98/1,780; RR ​= ​2.84, 95%CI 1.89 to 4.27, p<0.001; I2 ​= ​19.9, p ​= ​0.254). Extreme between-study heterogeneity was observed (I2 ​= ​93.4%, p<0.001). Sensitivity analysis, performed by sequentially removing each study and re-assessing the pooled estimates, showed that the magnitude and direction of the effect size was not modified (effect size range, 0.77 to 0.84). Begg's (p ​= ​0.50) and Egger's (p ​= ​0.86) t-tests did not show publication bias. In meta-regression analysis, the SMD was significantly and positively associated with the white blood count, aspartate aminotransferase, myoglobin, troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer.
Conclusions
Higher CK-MB concentrations were significantly associated with severe disease and mortality in COVID-19 patients. This biomarker of myocardial injury might be useful for risk stratification in this group.

AB  - Abstract
Objectives
SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic, with little prevention or treatment options. More than 600 million mortalities have been documented from SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the majority of fatalities occurring among elderly patients (aged >65 years). A number of vaccines have been developed in an effort to restrain the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the widespread administration of these vaccines, substantial side or undesired effects in multiple organ systems have emerged, necessitating essential critical care. Herein, we tabulate the adverse cardiovascular responses resulting from COVID-19 vaccines.
Design or Methods
We searched PubMed for articles published through April, 2022, with the terms “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “cardiovascular”, “SARS-CoV-2 vaccines”, “COVID-19 vaccines”, “myocarditis”, “pericarditis”, “thrombosis”, “thrombocytopenia”, “vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia”, “acute coronary syndrome”, “myocardial infarction”, “hypertension”, “arrythmia”, “postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome”, “Takotsubo cardiomyopathy”, “cardiac arrest” and “death”. We mainly selected publications from the past 3 years, but did not exclude widely referenced and highly regarded older publications. Besides, we searched the reference lists of articles identified by above search method and chose those we considered relevant.
Results
COVID-19 vaccines evoke rare but fatal thrombotic events, whereas messenger RNA\055based vaccines appear to be associated with risks of pericarditis/myocarditis, with the latter being more predominant in young adults following the second dose. Reports of other cardiovascular responses, including hypertension, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, and cardiac arrest, have also been indicated.
Conclusion
The undesired cardiovascular complications remain infrequent, giveng the large number of vaccinations inoculated to general population. And lower mortality takes precedence over the undesired cardiovascular complications.

AB  - Summary
A growing body of evidence indicates that obesity is strongly and independently associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19, including death. By combining emerging knowledge of the pathological processes involved in COVID-19 with insights into the mechanisms underlying the adverse health consequences of obesity, we present some hypotheses regarding the deleterious impact of obesity on the course of COVID-19. These hypotheses are testable and could guide therapeutic and preventive interventions. As obesity is now almost ubiquitous and no vaccine for COVID-19 is currently available, even a modest reduction in the impact of obesity on mortality and morbidity from this viral infection could have profound consequences for public health.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically perturbed the epidemiology of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) respiratory tract infections in children. The reasons for this are not clear. In this article, we review the current literature and critically discuss the different theories to explain why the epidemiology of RSV has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed mechanisms include decreased viral immunity in vulnerable age groups caused by the prolonged lack of RSV circulation early in the pandemic, potential Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced immune dysregulation, viral interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, and modifications in health-seeking behaviors as well as heath systems factors. Research in viral genomics and phylogeny, and more robust immunology research is needed to guide RSV prevention and health care resource planning.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 raised numerous questions on the interactions between the occurrence of new infections, the environment, climate and health. The European Union requested the H2020 HERA project which aims at setting priorities in research on environment, climate and health, to identify relevant research needs regarding Covid-19. The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be related to urbanization, habitat destruction, live animal trade, intensive livestock farming and global travel. The contribution of climate and air pollution requires additional studies. Importantly, the severity of COVID-19 depends on the interactions between the viral infection, ageing and chronic diseases such as metabolic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and obesity which are themselves influenced by environmental stressors. The mechanisms of these interactions deserve additional scrutiny. Both the pandemic and the social response to the disease have elicited an array of behavioural and societal changes that may remain long after the pandemic and that may have long term health effects including on mental health. Recovery plans are currently being discussed or implemented and the environmental and health impacts of those plans are not clearly foreseen. Clearly, COVID-19 will have a long-lasting impact on the environmental health field and will open new research perspectives and policy needs.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that began spreading globally in late 2019. While most cases of COVID-19 present with mild to moderate symptoms, COVID-19 was the third leading cause of mortality in the United States in 2020 and 2021. Though COVID-19 affects individuals of all races and ethnicities, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations are facing an inequitable burden of COVID-19 characterized by an increased risk for hospitalization and mortality. Importantly, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx adults have also faced a greater risk of non-COVID-19-related mortality (e.g., from cardiovascular disease/CVD) during the pandemic. Contributors to the racial disparities in morbidity and mortality during the pandemic are multi-factorial as we discuss in our companion article on social determinants of health. However, profound racial variation in the prevalence of CVD and metabolic diseases may serve as a key driver of worse COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related health outcomes among racial and ethnic minority groups. Within this review, we provide data emphasizing the inequitable burden of CVD and metabolic diseases among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations. We also discuss the pathophysiology of these conditions, with a focus on how aberrant physiological alterations in the context of CVD and metabolic diseases manifest to increase susceptibility to severe COVID-19.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant global impact, resulting in long-term health effects for many individuals. As more patients recover, there is a growing need to identify effective management strategies for ongoing health concerns, such as post-COVID-19 syndrome, characterized by persistent symptoms or complications beyond several weeks or months from the onset of symptoms. In this review, we explore the potential of dietary polysaccharides as a promising approach to managing post-COVID-19 syndrome. We summarize the immunomodulatory, antioxidant, antiviral, and prebiotic activities of dietary polysaccharides for the management of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Furthermore, the review investigates the role of polysaccharides in enhancing immune response, regulating immune function, improving oxidative stress, inhibiting virus binding to ACE2, balancing gut microbiota, and increasing functional metabolites. These properties of dietary polysaccharides may help alleviate COVID-19 symptoms, providing a promising avenue for effective treatment strategies.

AB  - Summary
Although the global COVID-19 pandemic response was quick to develop medical countermeasures, it failed to fully prevent morbidity and mortality in high-income countries and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). As new variants and post-COVID-19 condition continue to emerge and affect health systems and economies, the full human and economic cost is yet to be felt. We should now learn from these shortcomings and implement more inclusive and equitable frameworks to prevent and respond to outbreaks. This Series offers specific learnings from COVID-19 vaccination campaigns and non-pharmaceutical interventions, highlighting the need for resilient, inclusive, and equitable health systems. Taking action to rebuild trust and invest in resilient local manufacturing capacity, supply chains, regulatory frameworks, and placing LMIC voices at the centre of decision making will help to ensure preparedness for future threats. It is time to move beyond mere talk of learning and implementing lessons and instead take action towards a more resilient future.

AB  - Prolactin (PRL) is an endocrine hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland that has a variety of physiological effects, including milk production, immune system regulation, and anti-inflammatory effects. Elevated levels of PRL have been found in several viral infections, including 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), a viral pathogen that has recently spread worldwide. PRL production is increased in SARS-CoV2 infection. While PRL can trigger the production of proinflammatory cytokines, it also has several anti-inflammatory effects that can reduce hyperinflammation. The exact mechanism of PRL's contribution to the severity of COVID-19 is unknown. The purpose of this review is to discuss the interaction between PRL and SARS-CoV2 infection and its possible association with the severity of COVID-19.

AB  - India has the highest burden of incident tuberculosis (TB) cases and deaths globally. TB is strongly associated with poverty and this risk is largely mediated by undernutrition in India. COVID-19 response related lockdown has resulted in an economic crisis which may double levels of poverty, has exacerbated food insecurity, and disrupted TB services. These developments may have serious implications for TB progression and transmission in India. The nutritional status of a population is a strong determinant of the TB incidence, and undernutrition in adults alone accounts for 32–44% of TB incidence in India. A systematic review has shown that a 14% increase in TB incidence can occur per one unit decrease in body mass index (BMI), across the BMI range of 18.5–30 kg/m2. We believe that one unit decrease in BMI (corresponding to a 2–3 kg weight loss) may result in the poor in India as a result of the lockdown and its aftermath. This may result in an increase in estimated (uncertainty interval) incident TB by 185 610 (180 230, 190 990) cases. A 59% reduction in TB case detection between end March and May 2020, may result in an estimated (uncertainty interval) additional 87 711 (59 998, 120 630) TB deaths [19.5% increase (14.5, 24.7)] in 2020. Disadvantaged social groups and those living in states with higher levels of poverty, under-nutrition,and migrant workers are at particular risk. We suggest enhanced rations including pulses through the public distribution system and direct cash transfers to the poor pending restoration of livelihoods. TB services should be resumed immediately with enhanced efforts at case detection including active case finding. To prevent deaths among TB detected within the national TB programme, systemic identification, referral and management of severe disease at notification should be considered.

AB  - Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has a great impact on solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients due to their comorbidities and their maintenance immunosuppression. So far, studies about the different aspects of the impact of the pandemic on SOT recipients are limited.
Objectives
This systematic review summarizes the risk factors that make SOT patients more vulnerable for severe COVID-19 disease or mortality and the impact of immunosuppressive therapy. Furthermore, their clinical outcomes, mortality risk, immunosuppression, immunity and COVID-19 vaccination efficacy are discussed.
Methods
A systematic search on PubMed was performed to select original articles on SOT recipients concerning the following four topics: (1) mortality and clinical course; (2) risk factors for mortality and composite outcomes; (3) maintenance immunosuppression; (4) immunity to COVID-19 infection and (5) vaccine immunogenicity. Relevant data were extracted, analyzed and summarized in tables.
Results
This systematic review includes 77 articles. Mortality was associated with advanced age. Post-transplantation time or comorbidities were variably identified as independent risk factors for mortality or severe disease. However, generally, no comorbidity was reported as a major risk factor. SOT recipients have a higher risk of acute kidney injury, but no higher rate of mortality compared to non-transplanted patients was found. Immunosuppression was individually adjusted, without leading to high rates of graft dysfunction. Generally, no association between type of immunosuppression and mortality was found. SOT patients established humoral and cellular immune responses after COVID-19 disease comparable to immunocompetent people. At last, SOT patients experience a diminished immune response after two-dose vaccination with SARS-COV-2-mRNA-vaccines.
Conclusion
More research is needed to address the direct effect of COVID-19 disease on the graft in lung transplant recipients, as well as the factors ameliorating the immune response in SOT recipients.

AB  - Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines might have increased the incidence of giant-cell arteritis (GCA) and the risk of associated stroke in Spain.
Methods
Retrospective nation-wide observational analysis of all adults hospitalized with GCA in Spain during 5 years (Jan-2016 and Dec-2021). The incidence and proportion of admissions with or because of GCA and GCA-associated stroke were compared between pre-pandemic (2016–2019) and pandemic (2020 and 2021) years. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the different COVID-19 waves and vaccine timing schedules.
Results
A total of 17,268 hospital admissions in patients diagnosed with GCA were identified. During 2020 there were 79.3 and 8.1 per 100,000 admissions of GCA and GCA-associated stroke, respectively. During 2021 these figures were 80.8 and 7.7 per 100,00 admissions, respectively. As comparison, yearly admissions due to GCA and GCA-associated stroke were 72.4 and 5.7 per 100,00, respectively, during the pre-pandemic period (p < 0.05). Coincident with the third wave of COVID-19 (and first vaccine dosing), the rate of GCA-associated stroke admissions increased significantly (from 6.7 to 12%; p < 0.001). Likewise, there was an increase in GCA-associated stroke (6.6% vs 4.1%, p = 0.016) coincident with the third dose vaccination (booster) in patients older than 70 at the end of 2021. In multivariate analysis, only patients admitted during the third COVID-19 wave (and first vaccine dosing) (OR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.22–2.93), and during the third vaccination dosing in patients older than 70 (booster) (OR = 1.66, CI 1.11–2.49), presented a higher GCA-associated stroke risk than the same months of previous years after adjustment by age, sex, classical cardiovascular risk factors and COVID-19 diagnosis.
Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increased incidence of GCA during 2020 and 2021. Moreover, the risk of associated stroke significantly risen accompanying times of COVID-19 vaccine dosing, hypothetically linked to an increased thrombotic risk of mRNA-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Hence, forthcoming vaccine policies and indications must weigh the risk of severe COVID-19 with the risk of flare or stroke in patients with GCA.

AB  - COVID-19 has caused unprecedented disruptions to American society, yet the ramifications have exhibited a pronounced impact for racial/ethnic minority adolescents and their families. Alongside upheavals to social and learning environments, minoritized youth have navigated disproportionate health and socioeconomic challenges within their families in addition to amplified racial tensions. As a result, the pandemic has disparately impacted racial/ethnic minorities. In this review, we synthesize studies of the pandemic to describe the hardships faced by racial/ethnic minority families and adolescents, their reverberation on dimensions of well-being, and the assets which buttress their welfare in the midst of COVID-19. It is imperative that future pandemic response efforts aid the most vulnerable, particularly communities of color, to ensure equitable welfare and post-pandemic recovery.

AB  - More than 700 million confirmed cases of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) have been reported globally, and 10–60% of patients are expected to exhibit “post-COVID-19 symptoms,” which will continue to affect human life and health. In the absence of safer, more specific drugs, current multiple immunotherapies have failed to achieve satisfactory efficacy. Ginseng, a traditional Chinese medicine, is often used as an immunomodulator and has been used in COVID-19 treatment as a tonic to increase blood oxygen saturation. Ginsenosides are the main active components of ginseng. In this review, we summarize the multiple ways in which ginsenosides affect post-COVID-19 symptoms, including inhibition of lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor signaling, modulation of chemokine receptors and inflammasome activation, induction of macrophage polarization, effects on Toll-like receptors, nuclear factor kappa-B, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, lymphocytes, intestinal flora, and epigenetic regulation. Ginsenosides affect virus-mediated tissue damage, local or systemic inflammation, immune modulation, and other links, thus alleviating respiratory and pulmonary symptoms, reducing the cardiac burden, protecting the nervous system, and providing new ideas for the rehabilitation of patients with post-COVID-19 symptoms. Furthermore, we analyzed its role in strengthening body resistance to eliminate pathogenic factors from the perspective of ginseng-epidemic disease and highlighted the challenges in clinical applications. However, the benefit of ginsenosides in modulating organismal imbalance post-COVID-19 needs to be further evaluated to better validate the pharmacological mechanisms associated with their traditional efficacy and to determine their role in individualized therapy.

AB  - Objective
This sequential, prospective meta-analysis sought to identify risk factors among pregnant and postpartum women with COVID-19 for adverse outcomes related to disease severity, maternal morbidities, neonatal mortality and morbidity, and adverse birth outcomes.
Data Sources
We prospectively invited study investigators to join the sequential, prospective meta-analysis via professional research networks beginning in March 2020.
Study Eligibility Criteria
Eligible studies included those recruiting at least 25 consecutive cases of COVID-19 in pregnancy within a defined catchment area.
Methods
We included individual patient data from 21 participating studies. Data quality was assessed, and harmonized variables for risk factors and outcomes were constructed. Duplicate cases were removed. Pooled estimates for the absolute and relative risk of adverse outcomes comparing those with and without each risk factor were generated using a 2-stage meta-analysis.
Results
We collected data from 33 countries and territories, including 21,977 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy or postpartum. We found that women with comorbidities (preexisting diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease) vs those without were at higher risk for COVID-19 severity and adverse pregnancy outcomes (fetal death, preterm birth, low birthweight). Participants with COVID-19 and HIV were 1.74 times (95% confidence interval, 1.12–2.71) more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit. Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy were at higher risk of intensive care unit admission (relative risk, 5.53; 95% confidence interval, 2.27–13.44), ventilation (relative risk, 9.36; 95% confidence interval, 3.87–22.63), and pregnancy-related death (relative risk, 14.10; 95% confidence interval, 2.83–70.36). Prepregnancy obesity was also a risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes including intensive care unit admission (relative risk, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.26–2.60), ventilation (relative risk, 2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–3.51), any critical care (relative risk, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.28–2.77), and pneumonia (relative risk, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.18–2.33). Anemic pregnant women with COVID-19 also had increased risk of intensive care unit admission (relative risk, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.25–2.11) and death (relative risk, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–4.81).
Conclusion
We found that pregnant women with comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease were at increased risk for severe COVID-19–related outcomes, maternal morbidities, and adverse birth outcomes. We also identified several less commonly known risk factors, including HIV infection, prepregnancy underweight, and anemia. Although pregnant women are already considered a high-risk population, special priority for prevention and treatment should be given to pregnant women with these additional risk factors.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has now killed 1 of every 303 Americans. Whereas 4 vaccines are approved in the United States and masks are widely available, too few are fully immunized and most of the population has stopped wearing protective masks. The ongoing consequences of this include continued excess morbidity and mortality and the generation of immune-evading variants and subvariants, which in toto are injurious and ultimately self-defeating. Herein we briefly update and review COVID-19 vaccines, waning immunity, and new variants.

AB  - The impact of COVID-19 on the burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) during the early pandemic remains unclear. COVID-19 has become one of the leading causes of global mortality, with a disproportionate impact on persons with CVD. Studies of health facility admissions for CVD found significant decreases during the pandemic. Studies of hospital mortality for CVD were more variable. Studies of population-level CVD mortality differed across countries, with most showing decreases, although some revealed increases in deaths. In some countries where large increases in CVD deaths were reported in vital registration systems, misclassification of COVID-19 as CVD may have occurred. Taken together, studies suggest heterogeneous effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on CVD without large increases in CVD mortality in 2020 for a number of countries. Clinical and population science research is needed to examine the ways in which the pandemic has affected CVD burden.

AB  - The aim of the current review was to assess whether there was an association between obesity and higher levels of hospitalization, poor outcomes and mortality due to the disease of novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Methodology: A systematic review of articles on the novel coronavirus, containing information on obesity and its association with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. In the bibliographic research, four databases were used, with the terms ['COVID-19′] AND ['hospitalization'] AND ['obesity'] AND ['mortality']. Studies published from 12/01/2019 until 05/01/2020 were included. The research contains inclusive criteria targeting studies of humans adults infected by Sars-Cov-2, with or without comorbidities. This research was selected from publications in Spanish and English languages. Results: 96 articles were identified, 15 being presented in two databases. Twenty articles were included, with a population total estimated from 1 to 7671 patients, with a prevalence of obesity ranging from 13.3% to 68.6%. The association of obesity and mortality has been observed in at least 4 studies, that 85.3% of the population was hospitalized. Among 19 of the 20 studies, more severe forms of the disease were observed and in 14 of them, higher rates of complications among obese people infected with the new coronavirus. Limitation differences in the definition of obesity was observed among publications, of which obesity was considered from a body mass index >25 kg/m². Conclusions: In the current review, obesity and overweight were represented an unfavorable factor for infection of novel coronavirus, where the higher the BMI the worse the outcomes. This occurred by worsening the infection itself, as well as increasing the prevalence of hospitalizations, worst outcomes and greater lethality; especially when co-occurring with other chronic conditions and in the elderly as well. Given this evidence, greater attention is suggested to the obese and overweight population in the face of the current pandemic.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can cause life-threatening pathology characterized by a dysregulated immune response and coagulopathy. While respiratory failure induced by inflammation is the most common cause of death, micro-and macrovascular thrombosis leading to multiple organ failure are also causes of mortality. Dysregulation of systemic inflammation observed in severe COVID-19 patients is manifested by cytokine release syndrome (CRS) - the aberrant release of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1, TNFα, MP-1, as well as complement. CRS is often accompanied by activation of endothelial cells and platelets, coupled with perturbation of the balance between the pro-and antithrombotic mechanisms, resulting in thrombosis. Inflammation and thrombosis form a vicious circle, contributing to morbidity and mortality. Treatment of hyperinflammation has been shown to decrease thrombosis, while anti-thrombotic treatment also downregulates cytokine release. This review highlights the relationship between COVID-19-mediated systemic inflammation and thrombosis, the molecular pathways involved, the therapies targeting these processes, and the challenges currently encountered.

AB  - Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began, numerous studies have reported a concerning drop in the number of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) admissions. In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to compare the rate of AMI admissions and major complication during the pandemic, in comparison with pre-pandemic periods. Three major databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection) were searched. Out of 314 articles, 41 were entered into the study. Patients hospitalized for AMI were 35% less in the COVID-19 era compared with pre-pandemic periods, which was statistically significantly (OR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.56–0.74; I2 = 99%; p < 0.001; 28 studies). Patients hospitalized for STEMI and NSTEMI were 29% and 34% respectively less in the COVID-19 era compared with periods before COVID-19, which was statistically significantly (OR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.65 –0.78; I2 = 93%; p < 0.001; 22 studies, OR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.58–0.73; I2 = 95%; p < 0.001; 14 studies). The overall rate of in-hospital mortality in AMI patients increased by 26% in the COVID-19 era, which was not statistically significant (OR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.0–1.59; I2 = 22%; p < 0.001; six studies). The rate of in-hospital mortality in STEMI and NSTEMI patients increased by 15% and 26% respectively in the COVID-19 era, which was not statistically significant (OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 0.85–1.57; I2 = 48%; p = 0.035; 11 studies, OR = 1.35; 95% CI: 0.64–2.86; I2 = 45%; p = 0.157; 3 articles). These observations highlight the challenges in the adaptation of health-care systems with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The vigorous spread of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in the rapid infection of millions of people worldwide and devastation of not only public healthcare, but also social, educational, and economic infrastructures. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over time is due to the mutations that occurred in the genome during each replication. These mutated forms of SARS-CoV-2, otherwise known as variants, were categorized as variants of interest (VOI) or variants of concern (VOC) based on the increased risk of transmissibility, disease severity, immune escape, decreased effectiveness of current social measures, and available vaccines and therapeutics. The swift development of COVID-19 vaccines has been a great success for biomedical research, and billions of vaccine doses, including boosters, have been administered worldwide. BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer–BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) are the four major COVID-19 vaccines that received early regulatory authorization based on their efficacy. However, some SARS-CoV-2 variants resulted in higher resistance to available vaccines or treatments. It has been four years since the first reported infection of SARS-CoV-2, yet the Omicron variant and its subvariants are still infecting people worldwide. Despite this, COVID-19 vaccines are still expected to be effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death from COVID. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 pandemic focused on evolution of VOC and vaccination strategies against them.

AB  - Lifeways of worldwide people have changed dramatically amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and public health is at stake currently. In the early stage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, fibrinolytic system is mostly inhibited, which is responsible for the development of hypofibrinolysis, promoting disseminated intravascular coagulation, hyaline membrane formation, and pulmonary edema. Whereas the common feature and risk factor at advanced stage is a large amount of fibrin degradation products, including D-dimer, the characteristic of hyperfibrinolysis. Plasmin can cleave both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and γ subunit of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), a critical element to edematous fluid clearance. In this review, we aim to sort out the role of fibrinolytic system in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, as well as provide the possible guidance in current treating methods. In addition, the abnormal regulation of ENaC in the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 mediated hypofibrinolysis and hyperfibrinolysis are summarized, with the view of proposing an innovative view of epithelial ion transport in preventing the dysfunction of fibrinolytic system during the progress of COVID-19.

AB  - The raging COVID-19 pandemic is in its third year of global impact. The SARS CoV 2 virus has a high rate of spread, protean manifestations, and a high morbidity and mortality in individuals with predisposing risk factors. The pathophysiologic mechanisms involve a heightened systemic inflammatory state, cardiometabolic derangements, and varying degrees of glucose intolerance. The latter can be evident as significant hyperglycemia leading to new-onset diabetes or worsening of preexisting disease. Unfortunately, the clinical course beyond the acute phase of the illness may persist in the form of a variety of symptoms that together form the so-called “Long COVID” or “Post-COVID Syndrome”. It is thought that a chronic, low-grade inflammatory and immunologic state persists during this phase, which may last for weeks or months. Although numerous insights have been gained into COVID-related hyperglycemia and diabetes, its prediction, course, and management remain to be fully elucidated.

AB  - Acute cardiac manifestions of COVID-19 have been well described, while chronic cardiac sequelae remain less clear. Various studies have shown conflicting data on the prevalence of new or worsening cardiovascular disease, myocarditis or cardiac dysrhythmias among patients recovered from COVID-19. Data are emerging that show that patients recovering from COVID-19 have an increased incidence of myocarditis and arrhythmias after recovery from COVID-19 compared with the control groups without COVID-19. The incidence of myocarditis after COVID-19 infection is low but is still significantly greater than the incidence of myocarditis from a COVID-19 vaccine. There have been several studies of athletes who underwent a variety of screening protocols prior to being cleared to return to exercise and competition. The data show possible, probable or definite myocarditis or cardiac injury among 0.4–3.0% of the athletes studied. Recent consensus statements suggest that athletes with full recovery and absence of cardiopulmonary symptoms may return to exercise and competition without cardiovascular testing. In conclusion, patients with COVID-19 may be expected to have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, myocarditis or arrhythmias during the convalescent phase. Fortunately, the majority of patients, including athletes may return to their normal activity after recovery from COVID 19, in the absence of persisting cardiovascular symptoms.

AB  - Summary
COVID-19 has exacerbated endemic health inequalities resulting in a syndemic pandemic of higher mortality and morbidity rates among the most socially disadvantaged. We did a scoping review to identify and synthesise published evidence on geographical inequalities in COVID-19 mortality rates globally. We included peer-reviewed studies, from any country, written in English that showed any area-level (eg, neighbourhood, town, city, municipality, or region) inequalities in mortality by socioeconomic deprivation (ie, measured via indices of multiple deprivation: the percentage of people living in poverty or proxy factors including the Gini coefficient, employment rates, or housing tenure). 95 papers from five WHO global regions were included in the final synthesis. A large majority of the studies (n=86) found that COVID-19 mortality rates were higher in areas of socioeconomic disadvantage than in affluent areas. The subsequent discussion reflects on how the unequal nature of the pandemic has resulted from a syndemic of COVID-19 and endemic inequalities in chronic disease burden.

Critically ill patients with SARS-COV-2 infection frequently exhibit signs of high oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, which accounts for most of the mortality. Antiviral strategies to inhibit the pathogenic consequences of COVID-19 are urgently required. The nuclear factor erythroid 2–related transcription factor (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that is involved in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory defense in several tissues and cells. This review tries to present an overview of the role of Nrf2 in the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV2) disease (COVID-19) is a novel threat that hampers life expectancy especially in obese individuals. Though this association is clinically relevant, the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. SARS CoV2 enters host cells via the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 receptor, that is also expressed in adipose tissue. Moreover, adipose tissue is also a source of many proinflammatory mediators and adipokines that might enhance the characteristic COVID-19 cytokine storm due to a chronic low-grade inflammatory preconditioning. Further obesity-dependent thoracic mechanical constraints may also incise negatively into the prognosis of obese subjects with COVID-19. This review summarizes the current body of knowledge on the obesity-dependent circumstances triggering an increased risk for COVID-19 severity, and their clinical relevance.

AB  - Summary
Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection can develop symptoms that persist well beyond the acute phase of COVID-19 or emerge after the acute phase, lasting for weeks or months after the initial acute illness. The post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, which include physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments, are known collectively as long COVID or post-COVID-19 condition. The substantial burden of this multisystem condition is felt at individual, health-care system, and socioeconomic levels, on an unprecedented scale. Survivors of COVID-19-related critical illness are at risk of the well known sequelae of acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and chronic critical illness, and these multidimensional morbidities might be difficult to differentiate from the specific effects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We provide an overview of the manifestations of post-COVID-19 condition after critical illness in adults. We explore the effects on various organ systems, describe potential pathophysiological mechanisms, and consider the challenges of providing clinical care and support for survivors of critical illness with multisystem manifestations. Research is needed to reduce the incidence of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19-related critical illness and to optimise therapeutic and rehabilitative care and support for patients.

We also discuss the current state-of-art of the toxicological implications of these emerging contaminants. Initial research suggests that they may have harmful effects on aquatic organisms and human health. Future directions are suggested as further research is needed to fully understand the impacts of these contaminants on the environment and humans, as well as to develop effective approaches to mitigate their potential negative effects.

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 was also marked mainly by its symptoms of respiratory illness, which were named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its initial discovery, many other symptoms have been linked to acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as to the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Among these symptoms are different categories of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which continue to be the main cause of death worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that 17.9 million people die from CVDs each year, accounting for ∼32% of all deaths globally. Physical inactivity is one of the most important behavioral risk factors for CVDs. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected CVDs as well as the physical activity in different ways. Here, we provide an overview of the current status as well as future challenges and possible solutions.

AB  - Several studies over the last decade demonstrate the recruitment of immune cells, increased inflammatory cytokines, and chemokine in patients with metabolic diseases, including heart failure, parenchymal inflammation, obesity, tuberculosis, and diabetes mellitus. Metabolic rewiring of immune cells is associated with the severity and prevalence of these diseases. The risk of developing COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection increases in patients with metabolic dysfunction (heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and obesity). Several etiologies, including fatigue, dyspnea, and dizziness, persist even months after COVID-19 infection, commonly known as Post-Acute Sequelae of CoV-2 (PASC) or long COVID. A chronic inflammatory state and metabolic dysfunction are the factors that contribute to long COVID. Here, this study explores the potential link between pathogenic metabolic and immune alterations across different organ systems that could underlie COVID-19 and PASC. These interactions could be utilized for targeted future therapeutic approaches.

AB  - The global outbreak of COVID-19 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 causes damage to multiple organs by attaching to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Infected patients with co-morbidities like pulmonary, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular disorder, and diabetes are at higher risk of death. Individuals with diabetes are at higher risk of developing complications with SARS-CoV-2 infection because of abnormal glucose homeostasis, inflammation, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and HbA1C. On the other hand, the SARS-CoV-2 acts as a diabetogenic agent by binding to ACE2 in pancreatic β-cells causes cellular dysfunction, and elevation in blood glucose level in infected individuals. Zinc plays a pivotal role in storage, secretion, and action on insulin and also, it has antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory properties which has beneficial role on viral respiratory tract infection. Drugs dihydrotanshinone, quabain, saikosaponin B2, silvestrol hold promising antiviral activities on SARS helicase. Even, combination of drugs as interferon β-1b, lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin are used to control viral replication, and inflammation. Luteolin with dexamethasone inhibit cytokine production in SARS-CoV-2. Luteolin, quercetin, and kaempferol downregulate, inhibit the TMPRSS2 expression and 3CLpro preventing viral entry and replication inside the host cell. The current review attempted to elucidate the mechanistic link between COVID-19-pathophysiology, diabetes, insulin, and Zn. The study attempts to formulate “Drug repurposing” with Zinc-supplementation can be used as prototypes to minimize tissue injures by SARS-CoV-2 infection in diabetic. The analysis found Zinc-supplementation with most compatible natural drugs dexamethasone and luteolin, or quercetin/kaempferol provides a cost-effective and minimizes time spent on clinical trials. However, “Drug repurposing” with Zinc supplementation is likely to take several years clinical validation of therapeutic targets before it is deemed efficacious and approved.

AB  - Calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis is essential for maintaining physiological processes in the body. Disruptions in Ca2+ signaling can lead to various pathological conditions including inflammation, fibrosis, impaired immune function, and accelerated senescence. Hypocalcemia, a common symptom in diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cancer, septic shock, and COVID-19, can have both potential protective and detrimental effects. This article explores the multifaceted role of Ca2+ dysregulation in inflammation, fibrosis, impaired immune function, and accelerated senescence, contributing to disease severity. Targeting Ca2+ signaling pathways may provide opportunities to develop novel therapeutics for age-related diseases and combat viral infections. However, the role of Ca2+ in viral infections is complex, and evidence suggests that hypocalcemia may have a protective effect against certain viruses, while changes in Ca2+ homeostasis can influence susceptibility to viral infections. The effectiveness and safety of Ca2+ supplements in COVID-19 patients remain a subject of ongoing research and debate. Further investigations are needed to understand the intricate interplay between Ca2+ signaling and disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Since its first outbreak in 2020, the pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the death of almost 7 million people worldwide. Vaccines have been fundamental in disease prevention and to reduce disease severity especially in patients with comorbidities. Nevertheless, treatment of COVID-19 has been proven difficult and several approaches have failed to prevent disease onset or disease progression, particularly in patients with comorbidities. Interrogation of drug data bases has been widely used since the beginning of pandemic to repurpose existing drugs/natural substances for the prevention/treatment of COVID-19. Steroids, including bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) have shown to be promising for their potential in modulating SARS-CoV-2/host interaction. Bile acids have proven to be effective in preventing binding of spike protein with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme II (ACE2), thus preventing virus uptake by the host cells and inhibiting its replication, as well as in indirectly modulating immune response. Additionally, the two main bile acid activated receptors, GPBAR1 and FXR, have proven effective in modulating the expression of ACE2, suggesting an indirect role for these receptors in regulating SARS-CoV-2 infectiveness and immune response. In this review we have examined how the potential of bile acids and their receptors as anti-COVID-19 therapies and how these biochemical mechanisms translate into clinical efficacy.

AB  - Introduction
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally, becoming a long-lasting pandemic. Dengue is the most common arboviral disease in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. COVID-19 and dengue coinfections have been reported, associated with worse outcomes with significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, this study aims to determine the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 and dengue coinfection in Latin America.
Methods
A systematic literature review was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, LILACS, and BVS databases from January 1, 2020, to September 4, 2021. The key search terms used were "dengue" and "COVID-19".
Results
Nineteen published articles were included. The studies were case reports with a detailed description of the coinfection's clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and treatment features.
Conclusion
Coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and dengue virus is associated with worse outcomes with significant morbidity and mortality. The similar clinical and laboratory features of each infection are a challenge in accurately diagnosing and treating cases. Establishing an early diagnosis could be the answer to reducing the estimated significant burden of these conditions.

AB  - Summary
The risk factors for severe COVID-19 are diverse, yet closely resemble the clinical manifestations of catecholamine excess states (eg, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, immune dysregulation, and hyperglycaemia), suggesting a potentially common basis for disease. Unfortunately, severe illness (eg, respiratory failure, compromised cardiac function, and shock) incurred by COVID-19 hinders the direct study of catecholamines in these patients, especially among those on multiple medications or those on adrenaline or noradrenaline infusions, or both. Phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) are tumours that secrete catecholamines, namely adrenaline and noradrenaline, often in excess. PPGL are well studied disease processes in which the effects of catecholamines are easily discernible and therefore their potential biochemical and physiological influences in patients with COVID-19 can be explored. Because catecholamines are expected to have a role in patients with critical illness, patients on vasopressor infusions, and patients who sustain some acute and chronic physical stresses, the challenges involved in the management of catecholamine excess states are directly relevant to the treatment of patients with COVID-19. In this Personal View, we discuss the complex interplay between catecholamines and COVID-19, and the management of catecholamine excess states, while referencing relevant insights derived from the study of PPGL.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with various liver injury cases worldwide. To date, the prevalence, mechanism, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and outcomes of COVID-19-induced liver injury in various at-risk groups are not well defined. Liver injury may arise in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 from direct causes such as viral infection and indirect causes such as systemic inflammation, hypoxic changes, and drugs that exacerbate any pre-existing liver disease. Studies have found that patients with underlying liver disease are at higher risk of COVID-19-induced liver injury. Certain condition of cardiopulmonary and metabolic diseases and vulnerable stages in lifespan may also involve in the development of COVID-19-induced liver injury. This review summarized studies of COVID-19-induced liver injury in different at-risk groups regarding their clinical characteristics, parameters, and correlations of the severity with these indicators and signs as well as potential treatment suggestions, to increase attention to physiological and pathological conditions and continue liver function monitoring as they can help in strengthening early supportive treatment and reducing the incidence of adverse outcomes.

AB  - COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading disease, which has caught the world by surprise. Millions of people suffer from illness, and the mortality rates are dramatically high. Currently, there is no specific and immediate treatment for this disease. Remedies are limited to supportive regiments and few antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs. The lack of a definite cure for COVID-19 is the reason behind its high mortality and global prevalence. COVID-19 can lead to a critical illness with severe respiratory distress and cytokine release. Increased oxidative stress and excessive production of inflammatory cytokines are vital components of severe COVID-19. Micronutrients, metalloids, and vitamins such as iron, manganese, selenium, Zinc, Copper, vitamin A, B family, and C are among the essential and trace elements that play a pivotal role in human nutrition and health. They participate in metabolic processes that lead to energy production. In addition, they support immune functions and act as antioxidants. Therefore, maintaining an optimal level of micronutrients intake, particularly those with antioxidant activities, is essential to fight against oxidative stress, modulate inflammation, and boost the immune system. Therefore, these factors could play a crucial role in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. In this review, we aimed to summarize antiviral properties of different vitamins and minerals. Moreover, we will investigate the correlation between them and their effects in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Summary
Countries and areas in the Western Pacific region (WPR) experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and took various preventive measures, which affected non-communicable diseases (NCDs) risks and mortality. Due to differences in COVID-19 prevention measures and other characteristics such as culture, religions, political systems, socioeconomic development, lifestyles, and health care systems, the effects of COVID-19 on NCDs varied greatly among WPR countries. Most countries had an increased all-cause and NCDs mortality during the pandemic, but some developed countries, including New Zealand, Singapore and Australia reported decreased mortality. The pandemic and the preventive measures increased NCD risk factors including unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity and sleep disorders. The effects varied by socioeconomic status and health conditions. COVID-19 related stress, food shortages, and confined lifestyle had immediate detrimental effects on NCDs, and also affected pregnancy outcomes with long-term effects on NCDs risks in coming years.

AB  - Despite never imposing a lockdown, Taiwan achieved COVID-19 zero, with reporting only 56 local coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases after testing 126,987 individuals in 2020, and further contained a large outbreak rapidly and successfully in 2021. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, our infectious disease modeling results indicated that testing and contact tracing alone would fail to contain the pandemic. However, by supplementing this approach with general public surgical mask-wearing, the reproduction number (R0) could be suppressed to less than 1. This would effectively contain the virus's spread within Taiwan, particularly when combined with strict border control measures to prevent the overwhelming influx of imported COVID-19 cases and ensure the capacity of the medical and public health systems remains resilient. These modeling results became the theoretical basis behind the highly successful Taiwan model against COVID-19 during 2020–2021, supporting by negative excess mortality, seroepidemiological surveys, and molecular epidemiological analyses. This is a public health triumph demonstrating that a democratic and humane approach to the COVID-19 pandemic is not only feasible but highly effective. It also highlights the crucial role of infectious disease modeling in assisting the formulation of a successful national pandemic response.

Despite the large number of global casualities and severe symptomatology associated with COVID-19, a large number of individuals remain at elevated risk of infection and severe outcomes related to poor lifestyle behaviors and/or associated comorbidities. Beyond the well-known social distance and masking policies, maintaining an active lifestyle, minimizing the consumption of tobacco products, and maintaining an adequate nutrition status are some of the key factors that, in an affordable and accessible way, have the potential to improve health and minimize COVID-19 impact. In addition, bringing awareness of the higher risks and poor prognosis of COVID-19 when other conditions are present seems to be essential to protect those individuals with the highest risks.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had an unprecedented effect on global health, mortality and healthcare provision. Diabetes has emerged as a key disease entity over the pandemic period, influencing outcomes from COVID-19 but also a tantalising hypothesis that the virus itself may be inducing diabetes. An uptick in diabetes cases over the pandemic has been noted for both type 1 diabetes (in children) and type 2 diabetes but understanding how this increase in incidence relates to the pandemic is challenging. It remains unclear whether indirect effects of the pandemic on behaviour, lifestyle and health have contributed to the increase; whether the virus itself has somehow mediated new-onset diabetes or whether other factors such as stress hyperglycaemic of steroid treatment during COVID-19 infection have played a roll. Within the myriad possibilities are some real challenges in interpreting epidemiological data, assigning diabetes type and understanding what in vitro data are telling us. In this review article we address the issue of newly-diagnosed diabetes during the pandemic, reviewing both epidemiological and basic science data and bringing together both strands of this emerging story.

AB  - Summary
Clinical research is necessary for an effective response to an emerging infectious disease outbreak. However, research efforts are often hastily organised and done using various research tools, with the result that pooling data across studies is challenging. In response to the needs of the rapidly evolving COVID-19 outbreak, the Clinical Characterisation and Management Working Group of the WHO Research and Development Blueprint programme, the International Forum for Acute Care Trialists, and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium have developed a minimum set of common outcome measures for studies of COVID-19. This set includes three elements: a measure of viral burden (quantitative PCR or cycle threshold), a measure of patient survival (mortality at hospital discharge or at 60 days), and a measure of patient progression through the health-care system by use of the WHO Clinical Progression Scale, which reflects patient trajectory and resource use over the course of clinical illness. We urge investigators to include these key data elements in ongoing and future studies to expedite the pooling of data during this immediate threat, and to hone a tool for future needs.

AB  - Background
Although elderly people are at a huge risk of mortality due to COVID-19, the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in hospitalized elderly patients is poorly investigated. This meta-analysis and meta-regression aimed to generate pooled CFR due to COVID-19 in hospitalized elderly patients by sex, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), year, and continent and also to explain the potential source of the heterogeneity and variations in the pooled estimation of COVID-19 CFR.
Methods
We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Embase up to 31 July 2022. Eligibility assessment of records was performed independently in a blinded, standardized way by two reviewers. Meta-analysis and Meta-regression analysis were carried out to estimate pooled CFR and the potential sources of the heterogeneity.
Results
The study included 5683 confirmed hospitalized elderly COVID-19 patients, 1809 deaths, and 19 original articles from 10 countries. The pooled estimate of the overall CFR, and by male and female sexes were 29%, 34%, and 24%, respectively. We found CFR was decreased by increasing female sex proportion, GDP, and year of publication. Multivariate meta-regression analysis indicated that the age and sex of patients, continent, GDP, and year of the publication together explained the majority of the heterogeneity and variations in the pooled estimate of the hospitalized elderly COVID-19 CFR.
Conclusions
This review provided reliable pooled CFR measures for hospitalized elderly patients with COVID-19. Although COVID-19 fatality has decreased in hospitalized elderly patients over time, it is still high in hospitalized elderly patients and needs advanced treatment support.

When addressing the pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, it becomes evident that the disease targets pathways and domains affected by the main aging- and frailty-related pathophysiological changes. A closer analysis of the existing data supports a possible role of biological age rather than chronological age in the prognosis of COVID-19. There is a need for systematic, consequent action of identifying frail (not only older, not only multimorbid, not only symptomatic) persons at risk of poor outcomes.

In addition to the significant morbidity and mortality associated with acute illness from COVID-19, the indirect impact has been far-reaching, including substantial disruptions in chronic disease care. As a result of pandemic disruptions in health care, vulnerable and minority populations have faced health inequalities. The aim of this review was to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted vulnerable populations with limb-threatening peripheral artery disease and diabetic foot infections.

AB  - Objectives
After the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the severe COVID-19 burden falls upon immunocompromised patients who cannot mount an endogenous immune response after both vaccination and/or natural infection. They also experience persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection with high viral loads often unsuccessfully managed by the standard antiviral monotherapy regimen initially validated for treatment of COVID-19 immunocompetent patients, only. The off-label prescription of such monotherapy regimens in immunocompromised patients is likely to drive the emergence of treatment-related immune escape, relapses, excess morbidity, and mortality from both COVID-19 and delayed treatment of the underlying disorders. A possible treatment approach to mitigate such consequence is based on combined antiviral therapies.
Methods
We searched PubMed for case reports, case series and clinical trials reporting the usage of combined antiviral therapies for COVID-19.
Results
In this narrative review, we show that combinations of either small molecule antivirals or small molecule antiviral plus passive immunotherapies are safe and effective in small cohorts reported so far.
Conclusion
Considering the progressive loss of efficacy of all authorized anti-spike monoclonal antibodies, promising regimen options are reserved to combinations of small molecule antivirals and COVID-19 convalescent plasma from vaccinated donors.

AB  - COVID-19 is primarily classified as a respiratory disorder; however, various neurological symptoms have been reported in COVID-19 patients. Neurological manifestations may be the initial signs of COVID-19 and can develop in patients of different age groups and with or without underlying disease. COVID-19 causes a broad range of complications in the central nervous system. These include headaches, altered mental status, dizziness, seizures, cerebrovascular events, encephalitis, and other encephalopathies. Moreover, a broad spectrum of peripheral nervous system symptoms such as olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, neuropathy, visual impairments, neuralgia, cranial nerves palsy, and muscle involvement could manifest as symptoms. Despite various efforts, the exact pathogenesis of the COVID-19 neurological complications has not been clarified yet. Moreover, the reason for the development of neurological manifestation in only some COVID-19 patients has not been determined. This review focuses on the different neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19 and the possible pathological mechanisms hoping to provide new insights for diagnosis, therapies, or other forms of intervention.

AB  - Previous research on commercial determinants of health has primarily focused on their impact on non-communicable diseases. However, they also impact on infectious diseases and on the broader preconditions for health. We describe, through case studies in 16 countries, how commercial determinants of health were visible during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how they may have influenced national responses and health outcomes. We use a comparative qualitative case study design in selected low- middle- and high-income countries that performed differently in COVID-19 health outcomes, and for which we had country experts to lead local analysis. We created a data collection framework and developed detailed case studies, including extensive grey and peer-reviewed literature. Themes were identified and explored using iterative rapid literature reviews. We found evidence of the influence of commercial determinants of health in the spread of COVID-19. This occurred through working conditions that exacerbated spread, including precarious, low-paid employment, use of migrant workers, procurement practices that limited the availability of protective goods and services such as personal protective equipment, and commercial actors lobbying against public health measures. Commercial determinants also influenced health outcomes by influencing vaccine availability and the health system response to COVID-19. Our findings contribute to determining the appropriate role of governments in governing for health, wellbeing, and equity, and regulating and addressing negative commercial determinants of health.

AB  - Summary
The Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) have experienced the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in different ways and with different timelines, with some experiencing large outbreaks leading to high levels of morbidity and mortality with significant strain on health systems, while others have had no local transmission or delayed transmission until after vaccine rollouts started. Regardless of COVID-19 trends, the pandemic has had a large impact on the social, political, and economic landscape in the Pacific, the effects of which are still being understood. However, the pandemic has also put renewed focus and investment into public health systems and provided an opportunity for the PICTs to build on existing systems and recent capacity strengthening to improve public health in the Region.

AB  - There has been substantial excess morbidity and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic, not all of which was directly attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and many non-COVID-19 deaths were cardiovascular. The indirect effects of the pandemic have been profound, resulting in a substantial increase in the burden of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors, both in individuals who survived SARS-CoV-2 infection and in people never infected. In this report, we review the direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiovascular and cardiometabolic disease burden in COVID-19 survivors as well as the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cardiovascular health of people who were never infected with SARS-CoV-2. We also examine the pandemic effects on health care systems and particularly the care deficits caused (or exacerbated) by health care delayed or foregone during the COVID-19 pandemic. We review the consequences of: (1) deferred/delayed acute care for urgent conditions; (2) the shift to virtual provision of outpatient care; (3) shortages of drugs and devices, and reduced access to: (4) diagnostic testing, (5) cardiac rehabilitation, and (6) homecare services. We discuss the broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for cardiovascular health and cardiovascular practitioners as we move forward into the next phase of the pandemic.
Résumé
Durant la pandémie de COVID-19, les taux de surmorbidité et de surmortalité étaient considérables, mais pas toujours directement attribuables à l’infection par le SRAS-CoV-2, et de nombreux décès non liés à la COVID-19 étaient d’origine cardiovasculaire. La pandémie a eu de graves effets indirects qui ont augmenté sensiblement le fardeau des maladies vasculaires et les facteurs de risque cardiovasculaire, aussi bien chez les personnes qui ont survécu à une infection par le SRAS-CoV-2 que chez celles qui n’ont jamais contracté le virus. Nous examinons ici l’effet direct de l’infection par le SRAS-CoV-2 sur le fardeau des maladies cardiovasculaires et cardiométaboliques chez les survivants de la COVID-19, ainsi que les effets indirects de la pandémie sur la santé cardiovasculaire des personnes n’ayant jamais été infectées par le SRAS-CoV-2. Nous traitons aussi des effets de la pandémie sur les systèmes de soins de santé, en particulier des problèmes causés (ou exacerbés) par le report des soins ou le renoncement aux soins durant la pandémie. Nous passons en revue les conséquences : 1) du report ou du retard des soins dans les cas urgents; 2) de la transition vers la virtualisation des soins externes; 3) des pénuries de médicaments et d’appareils médicaux; ainsi que des difficultés d’accès : 4) aux tests diagnostiques, 5) aux services de réadaptation cardiaque et 6) aux soins à domicile. Nous présentons par ailleurs les conséquences globales de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur la santé cardiovasculaire et sur les praticiens en santé cardiovasculaire au moment où commence une nouvelle phase de la pandémie.

AB  - Scientists across the world are diligently seeking vaccines and cures for the novel SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) virus, which causes severe respiratory disease. Traditional medicine was found to have a significant therapeutic effect on recovering Covid-19 patients when combined with the infusion of corticosteroids, antivirals, and convalescent plasma. Here, we cover the contribution and effects of traditional medicine on Covid-19 patients. Early detection of Covid-19 and common safety precautions are among the infection prevention and control (IPC) techniques. The Covid-19 prevention methods include facemasks, social distancing, and vaccinations and are discussed. In addition, the survey of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, telemedicine, exposure detection via mobile apps, and electronic corona passport are also addressed. Although the vaccination pipeline looks promising in ending the Covid-19 infections, this review also provides awareness in the possibility of Covid-19 transmission within the community and the environmental impact of the pandemic.

AB  - Viral infections during childhood can increase susceptibilities to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. We are currently in the early years following a viral pandemic caused by the rapid evolution of highly transmissible, host-evading variants of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we place this virus and the disease it generates, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), in the context of inflammatory host phenotypes and psychosocial factors which exacerbate stress to the developing human nervous system. While exposures to pathogens and inflammation during neurodevelopment are well-studied risk factors in psychiatric research, the subtle effects on a child’s physiology of factors such as social isolation, food insecurity, and other social determinants of health are more difficult to identify and quantify. In this post-pandemic era, we have the unique opportunity to initiate in local community healthcare facilities, inclusive longitudinal studies to measure pandemic-mediated mental health outcomes in children of all races, ethnicities, genders, and other groups shaped by social, cultural, and as yet unidentified determinants. Toward this end, the identification of children in need of prompt psychiatric intervention may be accelerated by the use of biomarkers indicating COVID-19 infection status, inflammation, imbalances of the gut-brain axis, and acute and chronic stress. Especially promising are approaches combining these biomarkers with mental health screening tools such as the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Epic Patient Healthcare Questionnaire 9 (PHQ9).

AB  - This review shows that relatively simple changes to diet and lifestyle can significantly, and rapidly, reduce the risks associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in terms of infection risk, severity of disease, and even disease-related mortality. A wide range of interventions including regular exercise, adequate sleep, plant-based diets, maintenance of healthy weight, dietary supplementation, and time in nature have each been shown to have beneficial effects for supporting more positive health outcomes with COVID-19, in addition to promoting better overall health. This paper brings together literature from these areas and presents the argument that non-pharmaceutical approaches should not be overlooked in our response to COVID-19. It is noted that, in several cases, interventions discussed result in risk reductions equivalent to, or even greater than, those associated with currently available vaccines. Where the balance of evidence suggests benefits, and the risk is minimal to none, it is suggested that communicating the power of individual actions to the public becomes morally imperative. Further, many lives could be saved, and many harms from the vaccine mandates avoided, if we were willing to embrace this lifestyle-centred approach in our efforts to deal with COVID-19.

AB  - In 2015, the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, in its only award for treatments of infectious diseases since six decades prior, honoured the discovery of ivermectin (IVM), a multifaceted drug deployed against some of the world’s most devastating tropical diseases. Since March 2020, when IVM was first used against a new global scourge, COVID-19, more than 20 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have tracked such inpatient and outpatient treatments. Six of seven meta-analyses of IVM treatment RCTs reporting in 2021 found notable reductions in COVID-19 fatalities, with a mean 31% relative risk of mortality vs. controls. During mass IVM treatments in Peru, excess deaths fell by a mean of 74% over 30 days in its ten states with the most extensive treatments. Reductions in deaths correlated with the extent of IVM distributions in all 25 states with p < 0.002. Sharp reductions in morbidity using IVM were also observed in two animal models, of SARS-CoV-2 and a related betacoronavirus. The indicated biological mechanism of IVM, competitive binding with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, is likely non-epitope specific, possibly yielding full efficacy against emerging viral mutant strains.

AB  - Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a viral respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), may predispose patients to thrombotic disease, both in the venous and arterial circulations, because of excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis. In addition, many patients receiving antithrombotic therapy for thrombotic disease may develop COVID-19, which can have implications for choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of antithrombotic therapy. Moreover, during a time with much focus on COVID-19, it is critical to consider how to optimize the available technology to care for patients without COVID-19 who have thrombotic disease. Herein, the authors review the current understanding of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, management, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who develop venous or arterial thrombosis, of those with pre-existing thrombotic disease who develop COVID-19, or those who need prevention or care for their thrombotic disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to millions of deaths worldwide after its emergence in 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily affects respiratory function, but immune dysregulation leading to systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulopathy can predispose to systemic complications including hematologic and vascular complications. Treatment strategies for patients with COVID-19 have rapidly evolved and the effectiveness and safety of antithrombotic agents have been evaluated in multiple clinical trials. The findings have spurred interest in the prevention and treatment of the hematologic and vascular complications of non-COVID-19 respiratory infections. This review is focused on hematological and vascular complications of COVID-19, including their pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management. Because of the perpetually changing nature of the disease, the review places previous data in temporal contexts and outlines potential next steps for future research in COVID-19 and other severe respiratory infections.
Résumé
La pandémie de COVID-19 a entraîné des millions de décès dans le monde après son apparition en 2020. Le virus SRAS-CoV-2 qui en est responsable affecte principalement la fonction respiratoire, mais des dérèglements immunitaires menant à une inflammation généralisée, à une dysfonction endothéliale et à une coagulopathie peuvent prédisposer certaines personnes à des complications systémiques, notamment des complications hématologiques et vasculaires. Les stratégies de traitement pour les patients atteints de la COVID-19 ont évolué rapidement, et de nombreux essais cliniques ont porté sur l’efficacité et l’innocuité des agents antithrombotiques. Les conclusions ont suscité un intérêt envers la prévention et le traitement des complications hématologiques et vasculaires attribuables aux infections respiratoires autres que la COVID-19. Cette synthèse relève les complications hématologiques et vasculaires de la COVID-19, de même que leur physiopathologie, leurs manifestations cliniques et leur prise en charge. En raison de l’évolution continue de la maladie, les données précédentes sont placées dans leur contexte temporel, et des axes de recherche sur la COVID-19 et d’autres infections respiratoires graves sont proposés.

As the virus has swept through the world, already vulnerable elderly populations worldwide have faced a far greater burden of deaths and severe disease, crippling isolation, widespread societal stigma, and wide-ranging practical difficulties in maintaining access to basic health care and social services – all of which have had significant detrimental effects on their mental and physical wellbeing. In this paper, we present an overview of aging and COVID-19 from the interrelated perspectives of underlying biological mechanisms, physical manifestations, societal aspects, and health services related to the excess risk observed among the elderly population. We conclude that to tackle future pandemics in an efficient manner, it is essential to reform national health systems and response strategies from an age perspective. As the global population continues to age, elderly-focused health services should be integrated into the global health systems and global strategies, especially in low- and middle-income countries with historically underfunded public health infrastructure and insufficient gerontological care.

AB  - Summary
Current evidence suggests that severity and mortality of COVID-19 is higher in men than in women, whereas women might be at increased risk of COVID-19 reinfection and development of long COVID. Differences between sexes have been observed in other infectious diseases and in the response to vaccines. Sex-specific expression patterns of proteins mediating virus binding and entry, and divergent reactions of the immune and endocrine system, in particular the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, in response to acute stress might explain the higher severity of COVID-19 in men. In this Personal View, we discuss how sex hormones, comorbidities, and the sex chromosome complement influence these mechanisms in the context of COVID-19. Due to its role in the severity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we argue that sexual dimorphism has potential implications for disease treatment, public health measures, and follow-up of patients predisposed to the development of long COVID. We suggest that sex differences could be considered in future pandemic surveillance and treatment of patients with COVID-19 to help to achieve better disease stratification and improved outcomes.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infection and its clinical manifestations (COVID-19) quickly evolved to a pandemic and a global public health emergency. The limited effectivity of available treatments aimed at reducing virus replication and the lessons learned from other coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV-1 or NL63) that share the internalization process of SARS-CoV-2, led us to revisit the COVID-19 pathogenesis and potential treatments. Virus protein S binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) initiating the internalization process. Endosome formation removes ACE2 from the cellular membrane preventing its counter-regulative effect mediated by the metabolism of angiotensin II to angiotensin (1–7). Internalized virus-ACE2 complexes have been identified for these coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 presents the highest affinity for ACE2 and produces the most severe symptoms. Assuming ACE2 internalization is the trigger for COVID-19 pathogenesis, accumulation of angiotensin II can be viewed as the potential cause of symptoms. Angiotensin II is a strong vasoconstrictor, but has also important roles in hypertrophy, inflammation, remodeling, and apoptosis. Higher levels of ACE2 in the lungs explain the acute respiratory distress syndrome as primary symptoms. Most of the described findings and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including increased interleukin levels, endothelial inflammation, hypercoagulability, myocarditis, dysgeusia, inflammatory neuropathies, epileptic seizures and memory disorders can be explained by excessive angiotensin II levels. Several meta-analyses have demonstrated that previous use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers were associated with better prognosis for COVID-19. Therefore, pragmatic trials to assess the potential therapeutic benefits of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors should be urgently promoted by health authorities to widen the therapeutic options for COVID-19.
Resumo
A infeção por SARS-CoV-2 e as suas manifestações clínicas (COVID-19) evoluíram rapidamente para uma pandemia e um problema de saúde pública global. A efetividade limitada dos tratamentos existentes orientados apenas para a redução da replicação do vírus e as lições aprendidas com outros coronavírus que utilizam o mesmo recetor de internalização levaram-nos a revisitar a patogénese da Covid-19 e potenciais tratamentos. A proteína S do vírus liga-se à enzima conversora de angiotensina de tipo 2 (ECA2) iniciando o processo de internalização. A afinidade do SARS-CoV-2 para a ECA2 é superior à dos outros coronavirus, o que se correlaciona com a gravidade dos sintomas. A ECA2 acompanha o vírus no endossoma, tendo sido identificados complexos vírus-ECA2 internalizados dos três coronavírus referidos. A ausência da ECA2 na membrana celular compromete o metabolismo da angiotensina II em angiotensina (1-7), pelo que a acumulação de angiotensina II pode ser vista como a causa potencial dos sintomas. A angiotensina II é um potente vasoconstritor mas também desempenha papéis importantes em processos fisiopatológicos como a inflamação, fibrose, hipertrofia e apoptose. Níveis mais elevados de angiotensina II nos pulmões explicariam a síndrome de insuficiência respiratória aguda como síndrome primária. A maioria das alterações de parâmetros e outras manifestações clínicas, tais como o aumento dos níveis de interleucinas, a inflamação endotelial, a hipercoagulabilidade, a miocardite, a disgeusia, as neuropatias inflamatórias, as convulsões epiléticas e os distúrbios da memória, pode ser explicada por níveis excessivos de angiotensina II. Várias meta-análises demonstraram que o uso prévio de inibidores da enzima conversora da angiotensina (IECAs) ou antagonistas dos recetores da angiotensina (ARAs) está associado a um melhor prognóstico para a Covid-19. Deste modo, ensaios pragmáticos para avaliar os potenciais benefícios terapêuticos dos inibidores do sistema renina-angiotensina-aldosterona (SRAA) deveriam ser promovidos urgentemente pelas autoridades de saúde para se diversificar as opções terapêuticas para a Covid-19.

AB  - Discussions about potential long-term health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on immigrant health and the healthy immigrant effect (HIE) remain unaddressed. Drawing on Canada as a case study, we summarize the primary and secondary impacts of COVID-19 on immigrants. We find that recent and female immigrants as well refugees have fared far worse than either their more established and male counterparts or the Canadian-born population. We then discuss how COVID-19 might influence (or weaken) immigrants' previously documented health advantage. We highlight two structural conditions induced by the pandemic that may alter the health profile of immigrants; namely, immigration policy and delayed medical treatments. Reflections on the requisite data for monitoring and tracking the overall impact of COVID-19 on immigrants' health are included. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the Canadian patterns and its potential relevance to immigrants and the HIE in the United States.
