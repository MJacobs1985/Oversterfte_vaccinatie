AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is known to affect the cardiovascular system. Cardiac manifestations in COVID-19 can be due to direct damage to the myocardium and conduction system as well as by the disease's effect on the various organ systems. These manifestations include acute coronary syndrome, ST- segment elevations, cardiomyopathy, and dysrhythmias. Some of these dysrhythmias can be detrimental to the patient. Therefore, it is important for the emergency physician to be aware of the different arrhythmias associated with COVID-19 and how to manage them. This narrative review discusses the pathophysiology underlying the various arrhythmias associated with COVID-19 and their management considerations.

AB  - Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) are likely at increased risk for COVID-19 complications in the acute phase of the infection, and for a long time thereafter. Because in FH patients the level of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is elevated from birth and it correlates with the degree of systemic endothelial dysfunction, both heterozygous FH (HeFH) patients and, in particular, homozygous FH (HoFH) patients have a dysfunctional endothelium prone to further damage by the direct viral attack and the hyper-inflammatory reaction typical of severe COVID-19. Evidence to date shows the benefit of statin use in patients with COVID-19. In FH patients, the focus should therefore be on the effective lowering of LDL-C levels, the root cause of the expected excess vulnerability to COVID-19 infection in these patients. Moreover, the ongoing use of statins and other lipid-lowering therapies should be encouraged during the COVID pandemic to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular complications from COVID-19. For the reduction of the excess risk in FH patients with COVID-19, we advocate stringent adherence to the guideline determined LDL-C levels for FH patients, or maybe even to lower levels. Unfortunately, epidemiologic data are lacking on the severity of COVID-19 infections, as well as the number of acute cardiac events that have occurred in FH subjects during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such data need to be urgently gathered to learn how much the risk for, and the severity of COVID-19 in FH are increased.

AB  - Background
Pulmonary aspergillosis may complicate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and contribute to excess mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The disease is poorly understood, in part due to discordant definitions across studies.
Objectives
We sought to review the prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of COVID-19–associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) and compare research definitions.
Data sources
PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and MedRxiv were searched from inception to October 12, 2021.
Study eligibility criteria
ICU cohort studies and CAPA case series including ≥3 patients were included.
Participants
Adult patients in ICUs with COVID-19.
Interventions
Patients were reclassified according to four research definitions. We assessed risk of bias with an adaptation of the Joanna Briggs Institute cohort checklist tool for systematic reviews.
Methods
We calculated CAPA prevalence using the Freeman-Tukey random effects method. Correlations between definitions were assessed with Spearman's rank test. Associations between antifungals and outcome were assessed with random effects meta-analysis.
Results
Fifty-one studies were included. Among 3297 COVID-19 patients in ICU cohort studies, 313 were diagnosed with CAPA (prevalence 10%; 95% CI 8%–13%). Two hundred seventy-seven patients had patient-level data allowing reclassification. Definitions had limited correlation with one another (ρ = 0.268–0.447; p < 0.001), with the exception of Koehler and Verweij (ρ = 0.893; p < 0.001); 33.9% of patients reported to have CAPA did not fulfill any research definitions. Patients were diagnosed after a median of 8 days (interquartile range 5–14) in ICUs. Tracheobronchitis occurred in 3% of patients examined with bronchoscopy. The mortality rate was high (59.2%). Applying CAPA research definitions did not strengthen the association between mould-active antifungals and survival.
Conclusions
The reported prevalence of CAPA is significant but may be exaggerated by nonstandard definitions.

AB  - Recently, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has attracted the attention of scientists where it has a high mortality rate among older adults and individuals suffering from chronic diseases, such as chronic kidney diseases (CKD). It is important to elucidate molecular mechanisms by which COVID-19 affects the kidneys and accordingly develop proper nutritional and pharmacological strategies. Although numerous studies have recently recommended several approaches for the management of COVID-19 in CKD, its impact on patients with renal diseases remains the biggest challenge worldwide. In this paper, we review the most recent evidence regarding causality, potential nutritional supplements, therapeutic options, and management of COVID-19 infection in vulnerable individuals and patients with CKD. To date, there is no effective treatment for COVID-19-induced kidney dysfunction, and current treatments are yet limited to anti-inflammatory (e.g. ibuprofen) and anti-viral medications (e.g. Remdesivir, and Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine) that may increase the chance of treatment. In conclusion, the knowledge about kidney damage in COVID-19 is very limited, and this review improves our ability to introduce novel approaches for future clinical trials for this contiguous disease.

AB  - Summary
Up to 50% of the people who have died from COVID-19 had metabolic and vascular disorders. Notably, there are many direct links between COVID-19 and the metabolic and endocrine systems. Thus, not only are patients with metabolic dysfunction (eg, obesity, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and diabetes) at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 but also infection with SARS-CoV-2 might lead to new-onset diabetes or aggravation of pre-existing metabolic disorders. In this Review, we provide an update on the mechanisms of how metabolic and endocrine disorders might predispose patients to develop severe COVID-19. Additionally, we update the practical recommendations and management of patients with COVID-19 and post-pandemic. Furthermore, we summarise new treatment options for patients with both COVID-19 and diabetes, and highlight current challenges in clinical management.

AB  - In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adult heart transplantation. We highlight the decline in the number of adult transplantations performed throughout the pandemic as a consequence of restrictions imposed on individual programs and hospitals. There were challenges to maintaining cardiac transplant activity at multiple levels, including organ donation in intensive care units, logistical difficulties with organ procurement, and rapidly changing resource considerations at health system and jurisdictional levels. We also review the impact of COVID-19 on cardiac transplant recipients. Despite the high rates of morbidity and mortality observed during the initial phases of the pandemic among heart transplant patients infected with COVID-19, the availability of effective vaccines, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and specific antiviral therapies have drastically improved outcomes over time. Vaccines have proven to be safe and effective in reducing infections and illness severity, but specific considerations in the immunocompromised solid organ transplant population apply, including the need for additional booster doses to achieve sufficient immunisation. We further outline the strong rationale for vaccination before transplantation wherever possible. Finally, the COVID-19 response created a number of barriers to safe and efficient post-transplantation care. Given the need for frequent evaluation and monitoring, especially in the first several months after cardiac transplantation, the pandemic provided the impetus to improve virtual care delivery and explore noninvasive rejection surveillance through gene expression profiling. We hope that lessons learned will allow us to prepare and pivot effectively during future pandemics and health care emergencies.
Résumé
Dans cette revue, nous présentons une vue d’ensemble de l’influence de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur la transplantation cardiaque chez l’adulte. Nous soulignons la diminution du nombre de transplantations adultes réalisées tout au long de la pandémie en raison des restrictions imposées aux programmes individuels et aux hôpitaux. Le maintien de l’activité de transplantation cardiaque s’est heurté à de multiples difficultés, notamment le don d’organes dans les unités de soins intensifs, les problèmes logistiques liés à l’obtention des organes et l’évolution rapide des ressources au niveau des systèmes de santé et des juridictions. Nous examinons également l’incidence de la COVID-19 sur les transplantés cardiaques. Malgré les taux élevés de morbidité et de mortalité observés au cours des phases initiales de la pandémie chez les patients ayant subi une transplantation cardiaque et infectés par la COVID-19, la disponibilité de vaccins efficaces, d’une prophylaxie préexposition et de thérapies antivirales spécifiques a permis d’améliorer considérablement les résultats au fil du temps. Les vaccins se sont révélés sûrs et efficaces pour réduire les infections et la gravité de la maladie, mais des considérations spécifiques s’appliquent à la population immunosupprimée ayant subi une transplantation d’organe solide, notamment la nécessité d’administrer des doses de rappel supplémentaires pour parvenir à une immunisation suffisante. Nous soulignons en outre les arguments solides en faveur de la vaccination avant la transplantation, dans la mesure du possible. Enfin, la réponse à la COVID-19 a créé un certain nombre d’obstacles à l’innocuité et à l’efficacité des soins post-transplantation. Étant donné la nécessité d’une évaluation et d’un suivi fréquents, en particulier au cours des premiers mois suivant une transplantation cardiaque, la pandémie a donné l’élan nécessaire pour améliorer la prestation de soins virtuels et explorer la surveillance non invasive du rejet par l’entremise du profil d’expression génique. Nous espérons que les enseignements tirés nous permettront de nous préparer et de réagir efficacement lors de futures pandémies et urgences sanitaires.

AB  - Background
This study sought to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of plasmapheresis, Tocilizumab, and Tocilizumab with plasmapheresis treatment on the removal of inflammatory cytokines and improvement clinically of patients with severe COVID-19 in Intensive Care Units (ICU) due to the association between increased cytokine release and the severity of COVID-19.
Methods
This clinical trial study was conducted in three treatment arms in Iran. All patients received standard care and randomization into one of three treatment groups; Tocilizumab (TCZ) alone, plasmapheresis alone, or a combination of Tocilizumab and plasmapheresis. Demographics, clinical evaluation, oxygenation status, laboratory tests and imaging data were evaluated in the three groups and re-checked 48 h after the end of treatment trials. Primary outcomes were oxygenation status, the need for mechanical ventilation and the rate of death.
Results
Ninety-four patients were included in the trial after meeting the eligibility requirements. Twenty-eight patients received Tocilizumab alone, 33 had plasmapheresis alone, and 33 received both Tocilizumab and plasmapheresis. Baseline characteristics did not differ between three groups that included demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters. Following therapy, there was no difference between the three groups for CRP, ferritin, d-dimer, IL-6, pro-calcitonin and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (P > 0.05). While a significant reduction was found in CRP levels within each group (32.04 ± 42.43 to 17.40 ± 38.11, 51.28 ± 40.96 to 26.36 ± 33.07 and 41.20 ± 34.27 to 21.56 ± 24.96 in the tocilizumab, plasmapheresis, and combined group, respectively) (p < 0.05), procalcitonin levels were elevated significantly in the Tocilizumab group (0.28 ± 0.09 to 0.37 ± 0.11) (p < 0.05). Clinically there was no difference between the three groups following treatment for O2 saturation levels with supplementary oxygen at discharge, endotracheal intubation rate, use of NIVPP, mortality, mean hospital and ICU length of stay (p > 0.05).
Conclusion
Study results showed that the reduction of serum inflammatory markers, the rate of intubation and therapeutic complications including death were no different between the three groups; however, CRP levels were significantly reduced in all three groups, indicating that the interventions reduced inflammation likely through a reduction in the cytokine storm, though clinical outcomes were unaffected.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a global issue of concern for public health, environment and socio-economic setup. This review addresses several aspects of epidemiology, and pathogenesis, environmental resource quality (air quality, hazardous waste management, and wastewater surveillance issues), and socio-economic issues worldwide. The accelerated research activity in the development of diagnostic kits for SARS-CoV-2 is in progress for the rapid sequencing of various strains of SARS-CoV-2. A notable reduction in air pollutants (NO2 and PM2.5) has been observed worldwide, but high air polluted cities showed intense mortalities in COVID-19 affected areas. The use of health safety equipment halted transportation, and work-from-home policy drastically impacted the quantity of solid and hazardous wastes management services. Wastewater appeared as another mode of enteric transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, wastewater-based surveillance could act as a mode of the data source to track the virus's community spread. The pandemic also had a substantial socio-economic impact (health budget, industrial manufacturing, job loss, and unemployment) and further aggravated the countries' economic burden.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been concern about the concomitant rise of antimicrobial resistance. While bacterial co-infections seem rare in COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital wards and intensive care units (ICUs), an increase in empirical antibiotic use has been described. In the ICU setting, where antibiotics are already abundantly—and often inappropriately—prescribed, the need for an ICU-specific antimicrobial stewardship programme is widely advocated. Apart from essentially warning against the use of antibacterial drugs for the treatment of a viral infection, other aspects of ICU antimicrobial stewardship need to be considered in view of the clinical course and characteristics of COVID-19. First, the distinction between infectious and non-infectious (inflammatory) causes of respiratory deterioration during an ICU stay is difficult, and the much-debated relevance of fungal and viral co-infections adds to the complexity of empirical antimicrobial prescribing. Biomarkers such as procalcitonin for the decision to start antibacterial therapy for ICU nosocomial infections seem to be more promising in COVID-19 than non-COVID-19 patients. In COVID-19 patients, cytomegalovirus reactivation is an important factor to consider when assessing patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 as it may have a role in modulating the patient immune response. The diagnosis of COVID-19-associated invasive aspergillosis is challenging because of the lack of sensitivity and specificity of the available tests. Furthermore, altered pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties need to be taken into account when prescribing antimicrobial therapy. Future research should now further explore the ‘known unknowns’, ideally with robust prospective study designs.

AB  - Inflammation is an established driver of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and a mechanism linked to the increased susceptibility to fatal COVID-19 demonstrated by patients with cancer. As patients with cancer exhibit a higher level of inflammation compared with the general patient population, patients with cancer and COVID-19 may uniquely benefit from strategies targeted at overcoming the unrestrained pro-inflammatory response. Targeted and non-targeted anti-inflammatory therapies may prevent end-organ damage in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer and decrease mortality. Here, we review the clinical role of selective inhibition of pro-inflammatory interleukins, tyrosine kinase modulation, anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, and other non-targeted approaches including corticosteroids in their roles as disease-modulating agents in patients with COVID-19 and cancer. Investigation of these therapeutics in this highly vulnerable patient group is posited to facilitate the development of tailored therapeutics for this patient population, aiding the transition of systemic inflammation from a prognostic domain to a source of therapeutic targets.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide, and while the mortality rate remains the primary concern, it is becoming increasingly apparent that many COVID-19 survivors experience long-term sequelae, representing a major concern for both themselves and healthcare providers. Comparing long-term sequelae following COVID-19 to those of other respiratory viruses such as influenza, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1 is an essential step toward understanding the extent and impact of these sequelae. A literature search was carried out using the PubMed. database. Search-terms included “persistent”, “long-term”, “chronic”, and MeSH-terms for SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and Influenza. Only English-language articles were selected. Articles were screened by title/abstract and full-text readings. Key points for comparison were persistent symptoms > 4 weeks, virus type, study design, population size, admission status, methods, and findings. Thirty-one articles were included: 19 on SARS-CoV-1, 10 on influenza, and 2 on MERS-CoV-survivors. Damage to the respiratory system was the main long-term manifestation after the acute phase of infection. Quality of life-related and psychological sequelae were the second and third most widely reported symptoms, respectively. Consistent with long-term sequelae from COVID-19, persisting cardiovascular, neurological, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal impairments were also reported. In summary, the long-term sequelae following COVID-19 are a significant concern, and while long-term sequelae following influenza, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1 have also been reported, their prevalence and severity are less clear. It is essential to continue to study and monitor the long-term effects of all respiratory viruses so as to improve our understanding and develop strategies for prevention and treatment.

AB  - Diabetes, one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world, is strongly associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Scrupulous blood sugar management is crucial, since the worse outcomes are closely associated with higher blood sugar levels in COVID-19 infection. Although recent observational studies showed that insulin was associated with mortality, it should not deter insulin use in hospitalized patients requiring tight glucose control. Back and forth dilemma in the past with regards to continue/discontinue certain medications used in diabetes have been mostly resolved. The initial fears of consequences related to continuing certain medications have been largely dispelled. COVID-19 also necessitates the transformation in diabetes care through the integration of technologies. Recent advances in health-related technologies, notably telemedicine and remote continuous glucose monitoring, have become essential in the management of diabetes during the pandemic. Today, these technologies have changed the landscape of medicine and become more important than ever. Being a high-risk population, patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, should be prioritized for vaccination. In the future, as the pandemic fades, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases is expected to rise due to lifestyle changes and medical issues/dilemma encountered during the pandemic.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly pathogenic and transmissible virus. Infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 known as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be severe, especially among high risk populations affected of underlying medical conditions. COVID-19 is characterized by the severe acute respiratory syndrome, a hyper inflammatory syndrome, vascular injury, microangiopathy and thrombosis. Antiviral drugs and immune modulating methods has been evaluated. So far, a particular therapeutic option has not been approved for COVID-19 and a variety of treatments have been studied for COVID-19 including, current treatment such as oxygen therapy, corticosteroids, antiviral agents until targeted therapy and vaccines which are diverse in each patient and have various outcomes. According to the findings of different in vitro and in vivo studies, some novel approach such as gene editing, cell based therapy, and immunotherapy may have significant potential in the treatment of COVID-19. Based on these findings, this paper aims to review the different strategies of treatment against COVID-19 and provide a summary from traditional and newer methods in curing COVID-19.

AB  - COVID-19 incidence and case fatality rates (CFR) differ among ethnicities, stimulating efforts to pinpoint genetic factors that could explain these phenomena. In this regard, the multiallelic apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene has recently been interrogated in the UK biobank cohort, demonstrating associations of the APOE ε4/ε4 genotype with COVID-19 severity and mortality. The frequency of the ε4 allele and thus the distribution of APOE ε4/ε4 genotype may differ among populations. We have assessed APOE genotypes in 1638 Greek individuals, based on haplotypes derived from SNP rs7412 and rs429358 and found reduced frequency of ε4/ε4 compared to the British cohort. Herein we discuss this finding in relation to CFR and hypothesize on the potential mechanisms linking APOE ε4/ε4 to severe COVID-19. We postulate that the metabolic deregulation ensued by APOE4, manifested by elevated cholesterol and oxidized lipoprotein levels, may be central to heightened pneumocyte susceptibility to infection and to exaggerated lung inflammation associated with the ε4/ε4 genotype. We also discuss putative dietary and pharmacological approaches for the prevention and management of COVID-19 in APOE ε4/ε4 individuals.

AB  - Despite some indicators of a localized curtailing of cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevalence, CVD remains one of the largest contributors to global morbidity and mortality. While the magnitude and impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have yet to be realized in its entirety, an unquestionable impact on global health and well-being is already clear. At a time when the global state of CVD is perilous, we provide a continental overview of prevalence data and initiatives that have positively influenced CVD outcomes. What is clear is that despite attempts to address the global burden of CVD, there remains a lack of collective thinking and approaches. Moving forward, a coordinated global infrastructure that, if developed with appropriate and relevant key stakeholders, could provide significant and longstanding benefits to public health and yield prominent and consistent policy resulting in impactful change. To achieve global impact, research priorities that address multi-disciplinary social, environmental, and clinical perspectives must be underpinned by unified approaches that maximize public health.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and can be associated with serious complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. This condition is accompanied by a massive release of cytokines, also denominated cytokine storm, development of systemic oxidative stress and a prothrombotic state. In this context, it has been proposed a role for acetylcysteine (NAC) in the management of patients with COVID-19. NAC is a molecule classically known for its mucolytic effect, but it also has direct and indirect antioxidant activity as a precursor of reduced glutathione. Other effects of NAC have also been described, such as modulating the immune and inflammatory response, counteracting the thrombotic state, and having an antiviral effect. The pharmacological activities of NAC and its effects on the mechanisms of disease progression make it a potential therapeutic agent for COVID-19. NAC is safe, tolerable, affordable, and easily available. Moreover, the antioxidant effects of the molecule may even prevent infection and play an important role as a complement to vaccination. Although the clinical efficacy and dosing regimens of NAC have been evaluated in the clinical setting with small series of patients, the results are promising. In this article, we review the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the current knowledge of the mechanisms of action of NAC across disease stages. We also propose NAC posology strategies to manage COVID-19 patients in different clinical scenarios.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections present with increased disease severity and poor clinical outcomes in diabetic patients compared with their nondiabetic counterparts. Diabetes/hyperglycemia-triggered endothelial dysfunction and hyperactive inflammatory and immune responses are correlated to twofold to threefold higher intensive care hospitalizations and more than twice the mortality among diabetic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. While comorbidities such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension worsen the prognosis of diabetic COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 infections are also associated with new-onset diabetes, severe metabolic complications, and increased thrombotic events in the backdrop of aberrant endothelial function. While several antidiabetic medications are used to manage blood glucose levels, we discuss the multifaceted ability of metformin to control blood glucose levels and possibly attenuate endothelial dysfunction, inhibit viral entry and infection, and modify inflammatory and immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infections. These actions make metformin a viable candidate drug to be considered for repurposing and gaining ground against the SARS-CoV-2-induced tsunami in diabetic COVID-19 patients.

AB  - As of 25th July, 2022, global Disease burden of 575,430,244 confirmed cases and over 6,403,511 deaths have been attributed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Co-infections/secondary infections continue to plague patients around the world as result of the co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus, biochemical changes caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) especially significant elevation in free iron levels, immune suppression caused by SARS-CoV-2, and indiscriminate use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of severe COVID-19 disease. In such circumstances, opportunistic fungal infections pose significant challenge for COVID-19 disease therapy in patients with other co-morbidities. Although COVID-19-associated Mucormycosis (CAM) has been widely recognized, currently extensive research is being conducted on mucormycosis. It has been widely agreed that patients undergoing corticosteroid therapy are highly susceptible for CAM, henceforth high index of screening and intensive care and management is need of an hour in order to have favorable outcomes in these patients. Diagnosis in such cases is often delayed and eventually the disease progresses quickly which poses added burden to clinician and increases patient load in critical care units of hospitals. A vast perusal of literature indicated that patients with diabetes mellitus and those with other co-morbidities might be highly vulnerable to develop mucormycosis. In the present work, the case series of three patients presented at Chest Disease Hospital Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir infected with CAM has been described with their epidemiological data in supplementary section. All these cases were found to be affected with co-morbidity of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and were under corticosteroid therapy. Furthermore, given the significant death rate linked with mucormycosis and the growing understanding of the diseases significance, systematic review of the literature on CAM has been discussed and we have attempted to discuss emerging CAM and related aspects of the disease.

AB  - During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, obesity has been shown to be an independent risk factor for high morbidity and mortality. Obesity confers poor outcomes in younger (<60 years) patients, an age-group considered low-risk for complications, a privilege that is negated by obesity. Findings are consistent, the higher the body mass index (BMI) the worse the outcomes. Ectopic (visceral) obesity also promotes proinflammatory, prothrombotic, and vasoconstrictive states, thus enhancing the deleterious effects of COVID-19 disease. Less, albeit robust, evidence also exists for a higher risk of COVID-19 infection incurred with underweight. Thus, the relationship of COVID-19 and BMI has a J-curve pattern, where patients with both overweight/obesity and underweight are more susceptible to the ailments of COVID-19. The pathophysiology underlying this link is multifactorial, mostly relating to the inflammatory state characterizing obesity, the impaired immune response to infectious agents coupled with increased viral load, the overexpression in adipose tissue of the receptors and proteases for viral entry, an increased sympathetic activity, limited cardiorespiratory reserve, a prothrombotic milieu, and the associated comorbidities. All these issues are herein reviewed, the results of large studies and meta-analyses are tabulated and the pathogenetic mechanisms and the BMI relationship with COVID-19 are pictorially illustrated.

AB  - Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has helped to clarify the fair and equitable allocation of scarce medical resources, both within and among countries. The ethical allocation of such resources entails a three-step process: (1) elucidating the fundamental ethical values for allocation, (2) using these values to delineate priority tiers for scarce resources, and (3) implementing the prioritisation to faithfully realise the fundamental values. Myriad reports and assessments have elucidated five core substantive values for ethical allocation: maximising benefits and minimising harms, mitigating unfair disadvantage, equal moral concern, reciprocity, and instrumental value. These values are universal. None of the values are sufficient alone, and their relative weight and application will vary by context. In addition, there are procedural principles such as transparency, engagement, and evidence-responsiveness. Prioritising instrumental value and minimising harms during the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread agreement on priority tiers to include health-care workers, first responders, people living in congregate housing, and people with an increased risk of death, such as older adults and individuals with medical conditions. However, the pandemic also revealed problems with the implementation of these values and priority tiers, such as allocation on the basis of population rather than COVID-19 burden, and passive allocation that exacerbated disparities by requiring recipients to spend time booking and travelling to appointments. This ethical framework should be the starting point for the allocation of scarce medical resources in future pandemics and other public health conditions. For instance, allocation of the new malaria vaccine among sub-Saharan African countries should be based not on reciprocity to countries that participated in research, but on maximally reducing serious illness and deaths, especially among infants and children.

AB  - Covid-19 endangers lives, has disrupted normal life, changed the way medicine is practised and is likely to alter our world for the foreseeable future. Almost two years on since the presumptive first diagnosis of COVID-19 in China, more than two hundred and fifty million cases have been confirmed and more than five million people have died globally, with the figures rising daily. One of the most striking aspects of COVID-19 illness is the marked difference in individuals’ experiences of the disease. Some, most often younger groups, are asymptomatic, whereas others become severely ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia or proceed to fatal organ disease. The highest death rates are in the older and oldest age groups and in people with co-morbidities such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. Three major questions seem important to consider. What do we understand about changes in the immune system that might contribute to the older person’s risk of developing severe COVID-19? What factors contribute to the higher morbidity and mortality in older people with COVID-19? How could immunocompetence in the older and the frailest individuals and populations be supported and enhanced to give protection from serious COVID-19 illness?

SARS-CoV-2 has caused considerable mortality due to respiratory failure, highlighting the immediate need for successful therapies as well as the long-term need for antivirals to combat potential emergent mutants of coronaviruses. There are constant viral mutations are being observed due to which world is experiencing different waves of SARS-CoV-2. If our understanding of the virology and clinical presentation of COVID-19 grows, so does the pool of possible pharmacological targets. In COVID-19, the difficulties of proper analysis of current pre-clinical/clinical data as well as the creation of new evidence concerning drug repurposing will be crucial. The current manuscript aims to evaluate the repurposing of an anti-HIV drug Darunavir Ethanolate in COVID-19 treatment with in silico study and we discuss the therapeutic progress of Darunavir Etanolate, to prevent SARS-CoV-2 replication, which supports its clinical assessment for COVID-19 therapy.

AB  - Evidence suggests severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection is characterised by pulmonary and systemic microvasculature dysfunction, specifically, acute endothelial injury, hypercoagulation and increased capillary permeability. Diabetes, which is also characterised by vascular injury in itself, confers an increased risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. It has been suggested that pre-existing endothelial dysfunction and microvascular disease in diabetes will exacerbate the vascular insults associated with COVID-19 and thus lead to increased severity of COVID-19 infection. In this article, we evaluate the current evidence exploring the impact of microvascular complications, in the form of diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, in individuals with COVID-19 and diabetes. Future insights gained from exploring the microvascular injury patterns and clinical outcomes may come to influence care delivery algorithms for either of these conditions.

AB  - Aims
The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused great distress worldwide. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is well familiar but when it happens as part of COVID‐19 it has discrete features which are unmanageable. Numerous pharmacological treatments have been evaluated in clinical trials to control the clinical effects of CARDS, but there is no assurance of their effectiveness.
Materials and Methods
A systematic review of the literature of the Medline, Scopus, Bentham, PubMed, and EMBASE (Elsevier) databases was examined to understand the novel therapeutic approaches used in COVID-19-Associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and their outcomes.
Key findings
Current therapeutic options may not be enough to manage COVID-19-associated ARDS complications in group of patients and therefore, the current review has discussed the pathophysiological mechanism of COVID-19-associated ARDS, potential pharmacological treatment and the emerging molecular drug targets.
Significance
The rationale of this review is to talk about the pathophysiology of CARDS, potential pharmacological treatment and the emerging molecular drug targets. Currently accessible treatment focuses on modulating immune responses, rendering antiviral effects, anti-thrombosis or anti-coagulant effects. It is expected that considerable number of studies conducting globally may help to discover effective therapies to decrease mortality and morbidity occurring due to CARDS. Attention should be also given on molecular drug targets that possibly will help to develop efficient cure for COVID-19-associated ARDS.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, causing considerable mortality and morbidity worldwide, has fully engaged the biomedical community in attempts to elucidate the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and develop robust therapeutic strategies. To this end, the predominant research focus has been on the adaptive immune response to COVID-19 infections stimulated by mRNA and protein vaccines and on the duration and persistence of immune protection. In contrast, the role of the innate immune response to the viral challenge has been underrepresented. This overview focuses on the innate immune response to COVID-19 infection, with an emphasis on the roles of extracellular proteases in the tissue microenvironment. Proteinase-mediated signaling caused by enzymes in the extracellular microenvironment occurs upstream of the increased production of inflammatory cytokines that mediate COVID-19 pathology. These enzymes include the coagulation cascade, kinin-generating plasma kallikrein, and the complement system, as well as angiotensin-generating proteinases of the renin–angiotensin system. Furthermore, in the context of several articles in this Supplement elucidating and detailing the trajectory of diverse profibrotic pathways, we extrapolate these insights to explore how fibrosis and profibrotic pathways participate importantly in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. We propose that the lessons garnered from understanding the roles of microenvironment proteinases in triggering the innate immune response to COVID-19 pathology will identify potential therapeutic targets and inform approaches to the clinical management of COVID-19. Furthermore, the information may also provide a template for understanding the determinants of COVID-19–induced tissue fibrosis that may follow resolution of acute infection (so-called “long COVID”), which represents a major new challenge to our healthcare systems.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues to exert a substantial toll on the global health and world economy and is now expected to be hidden by COVID-19 for a while. The wrong consumption of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic will raise disastrous effects on AMR management and antibiotic stewardship programs. This is related to the concerns extrapolated due to an increase in mortality rates in patients with bacterial coinfections. Importantly, the immune system of COVID-19 patients in regions with high AMR may be fighting on two fronts altogether, the virus and MDR bacteria. Current control policies to manage AMR and prioritization of antibiotic stewardship plans are mandatory during this pandemic. This review aims to discuss the rising concerns of the excess use of antibiotics in COVID-19 patients highlighting the role of bacterial coinfections in these patients. Types of prescribed antibiotics and the development of antibiotic resistance is addressed as well.

AB  - The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is yet to be controlled worldwide, especially in India. The second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) led to panic and confusion in India, owing to the overwhelming number of the population that fell prey to this highly infectious virus of recent times. In the second wave of COVID-19, the patients had to fight both the virus and opportunistic infections triggered by fungi and bacteria. Repeated use of steroids, antibiotics, and oxygen masks during the management of severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients nurtured opportunistic infections such as mucormycosis. Despite mucormycosis being a decades-old disease, it has gained notice of its widespread occurrence in COVID-19 patients throughout India. Instances of mucormycosis are usually unearthed in immunocompromised individuals and are caused by the inhalation of filamentous fungi, either from the natural environment or through supportive care units. In the recent outbreak during the second wave of COVID-19 in India, it has been seen to cause secondary infection as it grows along with the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients with comorbidities such as diabetes were more likely to have the mucormycosis co-infection because of their challenged immune systems’ inability to fight it. Despite the hype, mucormycosis still remains neglected and least studied, which is predominantly due to all focus on diagnostics, vaccine, and therapeutic research. In this review, we emphasize mainly on the association of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients. We also present the molecular mechanism of mucormycosis for a better understanding of the fungal infections in patients who have recently been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Better understanding of fungal pathogens, immediate diagnosis, and management of the infections are crucial in COVID-19 patients, as high mortalities have been recorded in co-infected patients despite recovery from COVID-19.

AB  - ABSTRACT
During the emerging COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, initially there were no proven treatment options. With the release of randomised controlled trial (RCT) results, we are beginning to see possible treatment options for COVID-19. The RECOVERY trial showed an absolute risk reduction in mortality by 2.8% with dexamethasone, and the ACTT-1 trial showed that treatment with remdesivir reduced the time to recovery by 4 days. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and lopinavir/ritonavir did not show any mortality benefit in either the RECOVERY or World Health Organization (WHO) Solidarity trials. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Brazilian HCQ trials did not show any benefit for HCQ based on the seven-point ordinal scale outcomes. The randomisation methodologies utilised in these controlled trials and the quality of published data were reviewed to examine their adaptability to treat patients. We found that the randomisation methodologies of these trials were suboptimal for matching the studied groups based on disease severity among critically-ill hospitalised COVID-19 patients with high mortality rates. The published literature is very limited regarding the disease severity metrics among the compared groups and failed to show that the data are without fatal sampling errors and sampling biases. We also found that there is a definite need for the validation of data in these trials along with additional important disease severity metrics to ensure that the trials’ conclusions are accurate. We also propose proper randomisation methodologies for the design of RCTs for COVID-19 as well as guidance for the publication of COVID-19 trial results.

AB  - Tragically, the United States (US) surpassed one million documented deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A convincing association between unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and poorer outcomes associated with COVID-19 infection has already been demonstrated and communicated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in public health messaging. The US is experiencing not a pandemic, but a syndemic, specifically an unhealthy lifestyle behaviors–chronic diseases–COVID-19 syndemic. This syndemic has almost certainly significantly contributed to the more than one million deaths the United States has experienced during the pandemic. Decades of a high prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors laid the foundation for our current unfortunate situation by increasing vulnerability to a novel virus, especially among subgroups who have been historically marginalized. As such, a major pathway to defeating this syndemic is through the promotion of healthy living behaviors for all. Now is the time for action appropriate to meet the demands of a syndemic and a new path forward to a healthier and more equitable future.

AB  - Throughout the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, understanding the effects of COVID-19 on persons with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and Sickle Cell Trait (SCT) has garnered interest. Patients with SCD diagnosed with COVID-19 utilize the emergency department and are hospitalized at significantly higher rates compared to the general population, with vaso-occlusive crisis and acute chest syndrome as the leading presentations. Whether SCD alone increases the likelihood of severe COVID-19 illness remains uncertain; however, potential risk factors for severe disease among patients with SCD include older age, frequent acute care visits for pain, haemoglobin SC disease, and pre-existing end-organ disease. SCT status may also influence COVID-19 outcomes, particularly among those with pre-existing co-morbidities. Corticosteroids in patients with SCD and COVID-19 should be used with extreme caution given strong associations between corticosteroid exposure and severe vaso-occlusive crisis, with prophylactic transfusion administered if corticosteroids are deemed necessary. Hydroxyurea may be protective in COVID-19.

AB  - The latest WHO report determined the increasing diversity within the CoV-2 omicron and its descendent lineages. Some heavily mutated offshoots of BA.5 and BA.2, such as BA.4.6, BF.7, BQ.1.1, and BA.2.75, are responsible for about 20% of infections and are spreading rapidly in multiple countries. It is a sign that Omicron subvariants are now developing a capacity to be more immune escaping and may contribute to a new wave of COVID-19. Covid-19 infections often induce many alterations in human physiological defense and the natural control systems, with exacerbated activation of the inflammatory and homeostatic response, as for any infectious diseases. Severe activation of the early phase of hemostatic components, often occurs, leading to thrombotic complications and often contributing to a lethal outcome selectively in certain populations. Development of autoimmune complications increases the disease burden and lowers its prognosis. While the true mechanism still remains unclear, it is believed to mainly be related to the host autoimmune responses as demonstrated, only in some patients suffering from the presence of autoantibodies that worsens the disease evolution. In fact in some studies the development of autoantibodies to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified, and in other studies autoantibodies, thought to be targeting interferon or binding to annexin A1, or autoantibodies to phospholipids were seen. Moreover, the occurrence of autoimmune heparin induced thrombocytopenia has also been described in infected patients treated with heparin for controlling thrombogenicity. This commentary focuses on the presence of various autoantibodies reported so far in Covid-19 diseases, exploring their association with the disease course and the durability of some related symptoms. Attempts are also made to further analyze the potential mechanism of actions and link the presence of antibodies with pathological complications.

AB  - Background
Increasing number of patients with COVID-19-associated mucormycosis have been reported, especially from India recently. We have described a patient with COVID-19-associated mucormycosis and, searched and analyzed current medical literature to delineate the characteristics of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis.
Method
We reported a patient developed mucormycosis during post-COVID period. We searched literature to describe the incidence, clinical features, and outcomes of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis. Demographic features, risk factors, clinical features, diagnostic methods, treatment and outcome were analyzed.
Results
We describe a 54-year-old male, hospitalized due to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. He was given long-term, high doses of systemic steroids. He developed maxillo-fascial mucormycosis and died of sepsis. Our literature search found 30 publications describing 100 patients including present case report. The majority (n = 68) were reported from India. 76% were male. The most commonly seen risk factors were corticosteroid use (90.5%), diabetes (79%), and hypertension (34%). Also, excessive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics were noted in cases. Most frequent involvements were rhino-orbital (50%), followed by rhino-sinusal (17%), and rhino-orbito-cerebral (15%). Death was reported as 33 out of 99 patients (33,3%).
Conclusions
Steroid use, diabetes, environmental conditions, excessive use of antibiotics, and hypoxia are main risk factors. Despite medical and surgical treatment, mortality rate is high. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to improve the conditions facilitating the emergence of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis.

AB  - Disparities in screening mammography and barriers to accessing breast cancer screening are most prevalent among racial/ethnic minority and low-income women. The significant breast cancer mortality rates experienced in both Hispanic and African American populations are found to be connected to delayed screening. For these women to follow the screening guidelines outlined by the American College of Radiology and Society of Breast Imaging, they must successfully navigate existing barriers to screening. These barriers include differential access to care, language barriers, and lack of medical insurance. The COVID-19 Pandemic has worsened the barriers to breast cancer screening faced by these groups of women. These barriers need to be addressed or they may further exacerbate disparities.

AB  - The highly pathogenic, novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has emerged as a once-in-a-century pandemic with poor consequences, urgently calling for new therapeutics, cures, and supportive interventions. It has already affected over 250 million people worldwide; thereby, there is a need for novel therapies to alleviate the related complications. There is a paradigm shift in developing drugs and clinical practices to combat COVID-19. Several clinical trials have been performed or are testing diverse pharmacological interventions to alleviate viral load and complications such as cytokine release storm (CRS). Kinase-inhibitors have appeared as potential antiviral agents for COVID-19 patients due to their efficacy against CRS. Combination of kinase inhibitors with other therapies can achieve more efficacy against COVID-19. Based on the pre-clinical trials, kinase inhibitors such as Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) inhibitors, Brutton's tyrosin kinase (BTK) inhibitors, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) inhibitors, Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) inhibitors can be a promising strategy against COVID-19. Kinase inhibitors possess crucial pharmacological properties for a successful re-purposing in terms of dual anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects. This review will address the current clinical evidence and the newest discovery regarding the application of kinase inhibitors in COVID-19. An outlook on ongoing clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov) and unpublished data is also presented here. Besides, Kinase inhibitors' function on COVID-19-mediated CRS is discussed.

AB  - We present a new concept, Punt Politics, and apply it to the COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) in two epicenters of the pandemic: Mexico and Brazil. Punt Politics refers to national leaders in federal systems deferring or deflecting responsibility for health systems decision-making to sub-national entities without evidence or coordination. The fragmentation of authority and overlapping functions in federal, decentralized political systems make them more susceptible to coordination problems than centralized, unitary systems. We apply the concept to pandemics, which require national health system stewardship, using sub-national NPI data that we developed and curated through the Observatory for the Containment of COVID-19 in the Americas to illustrate Punt Politics in Mexico and Brazil. Both countries suffer from protracted, high levels of COVID-19 mortality and inadequate pandemic responses, including little testing and disregard for scientific evidence. We illustrate how populist leadership drove Punt Politics and how partisan politics contributed to disabling an evidence-based response in Mexico and Brazil. These cases illustrate the combination of decentralization and populist leadership that is most conducive to punting responsibility. We discuss how Punt Politics reduces health system functionality, providing lessons for other countries and future pandemic responses, including vaccine rollout.

AB  - The potential emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants capable of escaping vaccine-generated immune responses poses a looming threat to vaccination efforts and will likely prolong the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the prevalence of beta coronaviruses circulating in animals and the precedent they have set in jumping into human populations indicates that they pose a continuous threat for future pandemics. Currently, only one therapeutic is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in treating COVID-19, remdesivir, although other therapies are authorized for emergency use due to this pandemic being a public health emergency. In this review, twenty-four different treatments are discussed regarding their use against COVID-19 and any potential future coronavirus-associated illnesses. Their traditional use, mechanism of action against COVID-19, and efficacy in clinical trials are assessed. Six treatments evaluated are shown to significantly decrease mortality in clinical trials, and ten treatments have shown some form of clinical efficacy.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people and posed an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems and economies worldwide since the outbreak of the COVID-19. A considerable number of nations have investigated COVID-19 and proposed a series of prevention and treatment strategies thus far. The pandemic prevention strategies implemented in China have suggested that the spread of COVID-19 can be effectively reduced by restricting large-scale gathering, developing community-scale nucleic acid testing, and conducting epidemiological investigations, whereas sporadic cases have always been identified in numerous places. Currently, there is still no decisive therapy for COVID-19 or related complications. The development of COVID-19 vaccines has raised the hope for mitigating this pandemic based on the intercross immunity induced by COVID-19. Thus far, several types of COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and released to into financial markets. From the perspective of vaccine use in globe, COVID-19 vaccines are beneficial to mitigate the pandemic, whereas the relative adverse events have been reported progressively. This is a review about the development, challenges and prospects of COVID-19 vaccines, and it can provide more insights into all aspects of the vaccines.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a systemic disease that affects nearly all organ systems through infection and subsequent dysregulation of the vascular endothelium. One of the most striking phenomena has been a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)–associated coagulopathy. Given these findings, questions naturally emerged about the prothrombotic impact of COVID-19 on cerebrovascular disease and whether ischemic stroke is a clinical feature specific to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Early reports from China and several sites in the northeastern United States seemed to confirm these suspicions. Since these initial reports, many cohort studies worldwide observed decreased rates of stroke since the start of the pandemic, raising concerns for a broader impact of the pandemic on stroke treatment. In this review, we provide a comprehensive assessment of how the pandemic has affected stroke presentation, epidemiology, treatment, and outcomes to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on cerebrovascular disease. Much evidence suggests that this decline in stroke admissions stems from the global response to the virus, which has made it more difficult for patients to get to the hospital once symptoms start. However, there does not appear to be a demonstrable impact on quality metrics once patients arrive at the hospital. Despite initial concerns, there is insufficient evidence to ascribe a causal relationship specific to the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 on the cerebral vasculature. Nevertheless, when patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 present with stroke, their presentation is likely to be more severe, and they have a markedly higher rate of in-hospital mortality than patients with either acute ischemic stroke or COVID-19 alone.

AB  - In March 2020, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was officially declared a global pandemic, leading to closure of public facilities, enforced social distancing and stay-at-home mandates to limit exposures and reduce transmission rates. While the severity of this “lockdown” period varied by country, the disruptions of the pandemic on multiple facets of life (e.g., daily activities, education, the workplace) as well as the social, economic, and healthcare systems impacts were unprecedented. These disruptions and impacts are having a profound negative effect on multiple facets of behavioral health and psychosocial wellbeing that are inextricably linked to cardiometabolic health and associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19. For example, adoption of various cardiometabolic risk behavior behaviors observed during the pandemic contributed to irretractable trends in weight gain and poor mental health, raising concerns on the possible long-term consequences of the pandemic on cardiometabolic disease risk, and vulnerabilities to future viral pandemics. The purpose of this review is to summarize the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic on cardiometabolic health risk behaviors, particularly related to poor diet quality, physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors, smoking, sleep patterns and mental health. Additional insights into how the pandemic has amplified cardiovascular risk behaviors, particularly in our most vulnerable populations, and the potential implications for the future if these modifiable risk behaviors do not become better controlled, are described.

AB  - Clinical, laboratory, and autopsy findings support an association between coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and thromboembolic disease. Acute COVID-19 infection is characterized by mononuclear cell reactivity and pan-endothelialitis, contributing to a high incidence of thrombosis in large and small blood vessels, both arterial and venous. Observational studies and randomized trials have investigated whether full-dose anticoagulation may improve outcomes compared with prophylactic dose heparin. Although no benefit for therapeutic heparin has been found in patients who are critically ill hospitalized with COVID-19, some studies support a possible role for therapeutic anticoagulation in patients not yet requiring intensive care unit support. We summarize the pathology, rationale, and current evidence for use of anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 and describe the main design elements of the ongoing FREEDOM COVID-19 Anticoagulation trial, in which 3,600 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 not requiring intensive care unit level of care are being randomized to prophylactic-dose enoxaparin vs therapeutic-dose enoxaparin vs therapeutic-dose apixaban.

AB  - Racial and ethnic-related health disparities in the United States have been intensified by the greater burden of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in racial and ethnic minority populations. Compared to non-Hispanic White individuals, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx individuals infected by COVID-19 are at greater risk for hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and death. There are several factors that may contribute to disparities in COVID-19-related severity and outcomes in these minority populations, including the greater burden of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases as discussed in our companion review article. Social determinants of health are a critical, yet often overlooked, contributor to racial and ethnic-related health disparities in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx individuals relative to non-Hispanic White individuals. Thus, the purpose of this review is to focus on the essential role of social factors in contributing to health disparities in chronic diseases and COVID-19 outcomes in minority populations. Herein, we begin by focusing on structural racism as a social determinant of health at the societal level that contributes to health disparities through downstream social level (e.g., occupation and residential conditions) and individual level health behaviors (e.g., nutrition, physical activity, and sleep). Lastly, we conclude with a discussion of practical applications and recommendations for future research and public health efforts that seek to reduce health disparities and overall disease burden.

AB  - Introduction
The immunogenicity and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination varied by demographic, including solid organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy.
Aim
This purpose of this study is to assess seropositivity and seroconversion in solid-organ transplant recipients before and after third-dose COVID-19 vaccination.
Methods
This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis performed using PRISMA guidelines. To analyze clinical and cohort studies reporting immunologic response and seroconversion third-dose vaccination, a systematic search was performed using electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Directory of Open Access Journal (DOAJ), and Clinicaltrials.gov).
Result
There were 18 full-text papers that could be analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. After the third vaccination, the pooled rate seropositivity was 67.00% (95% CI 59.511; 74.047, I2 = 93.82%), and the pooled rate seroconversion was 52.51% (95% CI 44.03; 60.91, I2 = 92.15%). The pooled rate of seroconversion after the mRNA-based booster was 52.380% (95% CI 40.988; 63.649, I2 = 94.35%), and after the viral-vector-based booster was 42.478% (95% CI 35.222; 49.900, I2 = 0.00%).
Conclusion
Based on the analysis of immunologic responses and seroconversion findings, the third-dose vaccination of solid organ transplant recipients is an effective method in establishing better immunity against COVID-19.

AB  - The devastating pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused thousands of deaths and left millions of restless patients suffering from its complications. Increasing data indicate that the disease presents in a severe form in patients with pre-existing chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory system diseases, and renal diseases. This denotes that these patients are more susceptible to COVID-19 and have higher mortality rates compared to patients with no comorbid conditions. Several factors can explain the heightened susceptibility and fatal presentation of COVID-19 in these patients, for example, the enhanced expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in specific organs, cytokine storm, and drug interactions contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality. Adding to the findings that individuals with pre-existing conditions may be more susceptible to COVID-19, it has also been shown that COVID-19 can induce chronic diseases in previously healthy patients. Therefore, understanding the interlinked relationship between COVID-19 and chronic diseases helps in optimizing the management of susceptible patients. This review comprehensively described the molecular mechanisms that contribute to worse COVID-19 prognosis in patients with pre-existing comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal and renal diseases, blood disorders, autoimmune diseases, and finally, obesity. It also focused on how COVID-19 could, in some cases, lead to chronic conditions as a result of long-term multi-organ damage. Lastly, this work carefully discussed the tailored management plans for each specific patient population, aiming to achieve the best therapeutic outcome with minimum complications.

AB  - Acute cardiac manifestions of COVID-19 have been well described, while chronic cardiac sequelae remain less clear. Various studies have shown conflicting data on the prevalence of new or worsening cardiovascular disease, myocarditis or cardiac dysrhythmias among patients recovered from COVID-19. Data are emerging that show that patients recovering from COVID-19 have an increased incidence of myocarditis and arrhythmias after recovery from COVID-19 compared with the control groups without COVID-19. The incidence of myocarditis after COVID-19 infection is low but is still significantly greater than the incidence of myocarditis from a COVID-19 vaccine. There have been several studies of athletes who underwent a variety of screening protocols prior to being cleared to return to exercise and competition. The data show possible, probable or definite myocarditis or cardiac injury among 0.4–3.0% of the athletes studied. Recent consensus statements suggest that athletes with full recovery and absence of cardiopulmonary symptoms may return to exercise and competition without cardiovascular testing. In conclusion, patients with COVID-19 may be expected to have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, myocarditis or arrhythmias during the convalescent phase. Fortunately, the majority of patients, including athletes may return to their normal activity after recovery from COVID 19, in the absence of persisting cardiovascular symptoms.

AB  - The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has urged the establishment of a global-wide rapid diagnostic system. Current widely-used tests for COVID-19 include nucleic acid assays, immunoassays, and radiological imaging. Immunoassays play an irreplaceable role in rapidly diagnosing COVID-19 and monitoring the patients for the assessment of their severity, risks of the immune storm, and prediction of treatment outcomes. Despite of the enormous needs for immunoassays, the widespread use of traditional immunoassay platforms is still limited by high cost and low automation, which are currently not suitable for point-of-care tests (POCTs). Microfluidic chips with the features of low consumption, high throughput, and integration, provide the potential to enable immunoassays for POCTs, especially in remote areas. Meanwhile, luminescence detection can be merged with immunoassays on microfluidic platforms for their good performance in quantification, sensitivity, and specificity. This review introduces both homogenous and heterogenous luminescence immunoassays with various microfluidic platforms. We also summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the categorized methods, highlighting their recent typical progress. Additionally, different microfluidic platforms are described for comparison. The latest advances in combining luminescence immunoassays with microfluidic platforms for POCTs of COVID-19 are further explained with antigens, antibodies, and related cytokines. Finally, challenges and future perspectives were discussed.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic continues to spread globally. The rapid dispersion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 drives an urgent need for effective treatments, especially for patients who develop severe pneumonia. The excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines has proved to be an essential factor in the rapidity of disease progression, and some cytokines are significantly associated with adverse outcomes. Most of the upregulated cytokines signal through the Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Therefore, blocking the exaggerated release of cytokines, including IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFNα/β/γ, by inhibiting JAK/STAT signaling will, presumably, offer favorable pharmacodynamics and present an attractive prospect. JAK inhibitors (JAKi) can also inhibit members of the numb-associated kinase (NAK) family, including AP2-associated kinase 1 (AAK1) and cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK), which regulate the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) transmembrane protein and are involved in host viral endocytosis. According to the data released from current clinical trials, JAKi treatment can effectively control the dysregulated cytokine storm and improve clinical outcomes regarding mortality, ICU admission, and discharge. There are still some concerns surrounding thromboembolic events, opportunistic infection such as herpes zoster virus reactivation, and repression of the host’s type-I IFN-dependent immune repair for both viral and bacterial infection. However, the current JAKi clinical trials of COVID-19 raised no new safety concerns except a slightly increased risk of herpes virus infection. In the updated WHO guideline, Baricitinb is strongly recommended as an alternative to IL-6 receptor blockers, particularly in combination with corticosteroids, in patients with severe or critical COVID-19. Future studies will explore the application of JAKi to COVID-19 treatment in greater detail, such as the optimal timing and course of JAKi treatment, individualized medication strategies based on pharmacogenomics, and the effect of combined medications.

AB  - The SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) causes Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), is an emerging viral infection. SARS CoV-2 infects target cells by attaching to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE2). SARS CoV-2 could cause cardiac damage in patients with severe COVID-19, as ACE2 is expressed in cardiac cells, including cardiomyocytes, pericytes, and fibroblasts, and coronavirus could directly infect these cells. Cardiovascular disorders are the most frequent comorbidity found in COVID-19 patients. Immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and T cells may produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis if their functions are uncontrolled. This causes a cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients, which has been associated with cardiac damage. Tregs are a subset of immune cells that regulate immune and inflammatory responses. Tregs suppress inflammation and improve cardiovascular function through a variety of mechanisms. This is an exciting research area to explore the cellular, molecular, and immunological mechanisms related to reducing risks of cardiovascular complications in severe COVID-19. This review evaluated whether Tregs can affect COVID-19-related cardiovascular complications, as well as the mechanisms through which Tregs act.

AB  - Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 2 million deaths globally. Two interconnected stages of disease are generally recognised; an initial viral stage and a subsequent immune response phase with the clinical characteristics of hyperinflammation associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, many immune modulators and immunosuppressive drugs, which are widely used in rheumatological practice, have been proposed as treatments for patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. In this Review, we provide an overview of what is currently known about the efficacy and safety of antirheumatic therapies for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Dexamethasone has been shown to reduce COVID-19 related mortality, interleukin-6 inhibitors to reduce risk of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support, and baricitinib to reduce time to recovery in hospitalised patients requiring oxygen support. Further studies are needed to identify whether there is any role for glucocorticoids in patients with less severe COVID-19. Although evidence on the use of other antirheumatic drugs has suggested some benefits, results from adequately powered clinical trials are urgently needed. The heterogeneity in dosing and the absence of uniform inclusion criteria and defined stage of disease studied in many clinical trials have affected the conclusions and comparability of trial results. However, after the success of dexamethasone in proving the anti-inflammatory hypothesis, the next 12 months will undoubtedly bring further clarity about the clinical utility and optimal dose and timing of other anti-rheumatic drugs in the management of COVID-19.

AB  - The pandemic COVID-19 has spread widely throughout the globe and has been responsible for millions of deaths worldwide. Recently, it has been identified that there is no specific and 100% effective treatment available to manage the infection especially for the severe cases. A significant amount of research efforts and clinical trials have been undertaken globally and many more are underway to find the potential treatment option. Earlier, convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin was effectively used in the treatment of many endemic or epidemic viral infections as a part of passive immunization. In this article, we have touched upon the immunopathology of COVID-19 infection, a basic understanding of convalescent plasma, it's manufacturing as well as evaluation, and have reviewed the scientific developments focussing on the potential of convalescent plasma vis-à-vis other modalities for the management of COVID-19. The article also covers various research approaches, clinical trials conducted globally, and the clinical trials which are at various stages for exploring the efficacy and safety of the convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) to predict its future perspective to manage COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) currently has few effective treatments. Given the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness and uptake of a vaccine, it is important that the search for treatments continue. An exaggerated inflammatory state is likely responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, have been shown to be associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, TNF blockade reduces not only biologically active TNF but other pro-inflammatory cytokines important in COVID-19 hyperinflammation. Observational data from patients already on anti-TNF therapy show a reduced rate of COVID-19 poor outcomes and death compared with other immune-suppressing therapies. Anti-TNF has a long history of safe use, including in special at-risk populations, and is widely available. The case to adequately assess anti-TNF as a treatment for COVID-19 is compelling.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with specific coagulopathy that frequently occurs during the different phases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and can result in thrombotic complications and/or death. This COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) exhibits some of the features associated with thrombotic microangiopathy, particularly complement-mediated hemolytic-uremic syndrome. In some cases, due to the anti-phospholipid antibodies, CAC resembles catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome. In other patients, it exhibits features of hemophagocytic syndrome. CAC is mainly identified by: increases in fibrinogen, D-dimers, and von Willebrand factor (released from activated endothelial cells), consumption of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13 (ADAMTS13), over activated and dysregulated complement, and elevated plasma cytokine levels. CAC manifests as both major cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events and dysfunctional microcirculation, which leads to multiple organ damage. It is not clear whether the mainstay of COVID-19 is complement overactivation, cytokine/chemokine activation, or a combination of these activities. Available data have suggested that non-critically ill hospitalized patients should be administered full-dose heparin. In critically ill, full dose heparin treatment is discouraged due to higher mortality rate. In addition to anti-coagulation, four different host-directed therapeutic pathways have recently emerged that influence CAC: (1) Anti-von Willebrand factor monoclonal antibodies; (2) activated complement C5a inhibitors; (3) recombinant ADAMTS13; and (4) Interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 antibodies. Moreover, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the virus surface protein have been tested. However, the role of antiplatelet treatment remains unclear for patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Pregnancy-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is fast becoming a growing and clinically relevant subgroup of ARDS amidst global outbreaks of various viral respiratory pathogens that include H1N1-influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the most recent COVID-19 pandemic. Pregnancy is a risk factor for severe viral-induced ARDS and commonly associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes including fetal growth-restriction, preterm birth, and spontaneous abortion. Physiologic changes of pregnancy further compounded by mechanical and immunologic alterations are theorized to impact the development of ARDS from viral pneumonia. The COVID-19 sub-phenotype of ARDS share overlapping molecular features of maternal pathogenicity of pregnancy with respect to immune-dysregulation and endothelial/microvascular injury (i.e., preeclampsia) that may in part explain a trend toward poor maternal and fetal outcomes seen with severe COVID-19 maternal infections. To date, current ARDS diagnostic criteria and treatment management fail to include and consider physiologic adaptations that are unique to maternal physiology of pregnancy and consideration of maternal-fetal interactions. Treatment focused on lung-protective ventilation strategies have been shown to improve clinical outcomes in adults with ARDS but may have adverse maternal-fetal interactions when applied in pregnancy-related ARDS. No specific pharmacotherapy has been identified to improve outcomes in pregnancy with ARDS. Adjunctive therapies aimed at immune-modulation and anti-viral treatment with COVID-19 infection during pregnancy have been reported but data in regard to its efficacy and safety is currently lacking.

AB  - While it took decades to arrive to a conclusion that ferritin is more than an indicator of iron storage level, it took a short period of time through the COVID-19 pandemic to wonder what the reason behind high levels of ferritin in patients with severe COVID-19 might be. Unsurprisingly, acute phase reactant was not a satisfactory explanation. Moreover, the behavior of ferritin in patients with severe COVID-19 and the subsequent high mortality rates in patients with high ferritin levels necessitated further investigations to understand the role of ferritin in the diseases. Ferritin was initially described to accompany various acute infections, both viral and bacterial, indicating an acute response to inflammation. However, with the introduction of the hyperferritinemic syndrome connecting four severe pathological conditions such as adult-onset Still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and septic shock added another aspect of ferritin where it could have a pathogenetic role rather than an extremely elevated protein only. In fact, suggesting that COVID-19 is a new member in the spectrum of hyperferritinemic syndrome besides the four mentioned conditions could hopefully direct further search on the pathogenetic role of ferritin. Doubtlessly, improving our understanding of those aspects of ferritin would enormously contribute to better coping with severe diseases in terms of treatment and prevention of complications. The origin, history, importance, and the advances of searching the role of ferritin in various pathological and clinical processes are presented hereby in our article. In addition, the implications of ferritin in COVID-19 are addressed.

AB  - Introduction
Vaccination represents an important strategy to mitigate COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality by protecting against severe forms of the disease and reducing hospitalization and death rates. In this sense, the objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of Vaccination Intention (VI) against COVID-19 in Latin America and Caribbean (LAC).
Methods
We conducted a systematic review with a comprehensive search strategy for the following databases: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. A random-effect model meta-analysis was carried out using observational studies assessing the intention to vaccines against COVID-19 in LAC countries. The Clopper-Pearson method was used to estimate 95% Confidence Intervals. The quality assessment was developed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale adapted for cross-sectional studies. A subgroup analysis by study location and a sensitivity analysis were developed.
Results
Nineteen cross-sectional studies were included. Five meta-analyzes were performed according to the target population of the included studies. The VI in the general population of LAC was 78.0% (95%CI: 74.0%–82.0%). The VI for non-pregnant women was 78.0% (95%CI: 58.0%–99.0%), for elderly population was 63.0% (95%CI: 59.0%–69.0%), for pregnant women was 69.0% (95%CI: 61.0%–76.0%) and for health-personnel was 83.0% (95% CI: 71.0%–96.0%). The sensitivity analysis for general population meta-analysis that included only low risk of bias studies showed a 77.0% VI (95%CI: 73.0%–82.0%) and for non-pregnant women, 85.0% VI (95%CI: 79.0%–90.0%).
Conclusion
Despite the high prevalence of VI in general population found in our study, VI prevalence from elderly people and pregnant women are lower than other population groups and overall population.

AB  - The extent to which power, resources, and responsibilities for public health are centralized or decentralized within a jurisdiction and how public health functions are integrated or coordinated with health care services may shape pandemic responses. However, little is known about the impacts of centralization and integration on public health system responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We examine how public health leaders perceive centralization and integration facilitated and impeded effective COVID-19 responses in three Canadian provinces. We conducted a comparative case study involving semi-structured interviews with 58 public health system leaders in three Canadian provinces with varying degrees of centralization and integration. Greater public health system centralization and integration was seen by public health leaders to facilitate more rapidly initiated and well-coordinated provincial COVID-19 responses. Decentralization may have enabled locally tailored responses in the context of limited provincial leadership. Opacity in provincial decision-making processes, jurisdictional ambiguity impacting Indigenous communities, and ineffectual public health investments were impediments across jurisdictions and thus appear to be less impacted by centralization and integration. Our study generates novel insights about potential structural facilitators and impediments of effective COVID-19 pandemic responses during the second year of the pandemic. Findings highlight key areas for future research to inform system design that support leaders to manage large-scale public health emergencies.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has profound adverse effects on the population on dialysis. Patients requiring dialysis are at an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality, and many have experienced psychological distress as well as delayed or suboptimal care. COVID-19 survivors have prolonged viral shedding, but generally develop a robust and long-lasting humoral immune response that correlates with initial disease severity. However, protection against reinfection is incomplete. A growing body of evidence reveals delayed and blunted immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Administration of a third dose within 1 to 2 months of prime-boost vaccination significantly increases antibody levels, in particular in patients with poor initial responses. Patients on dialysis have inferior immune responses to adenoviral vector vaccines than to mRNA vaccines. The immunogenicity of the mRNA-1273 vaccine is markedly better than that of the BNT162b2 vaccine, most likely by virtue of its higher mRNA content. Despite suboptimal immune responses in patients on dialysis, preliminary data suggest that vaccination partially protects against infection and severe disease requiring hospitalization. However, progressive waning of immunity and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with a high potential of immune escape call for a booster dose in all patients on dialysis 4 to 6 months after prime-boost vaccination. Patients with persistent poor vaccine responses may be candidates for primary prophylaxis strategies. In the absence of specific data in patients on dialysis, therapeutic strategies in the event of established COVID-19 must be extrapolated from evidence obtained in the population not on dialysis. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies may be an attractive option after a high-risk exposure or during the early course of infection.

AB  - Prior to COVID-19, only two human-tropic coronaviruses resulted in epidemics and cerebrovascular disease was rarely reported. Evidence now suggests that 1–6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients develop stroke. According to some reports, stroke risk is more than sevenfold greater in patients with COVID-19 than influenza. Concerningly, outcomes of COVID-19-related stroke are often worse than in stroke patients without COVID-19 from the same cohorts. In this review, we highlight the emerging association between COVID-19 and stroke and discuss putative pathogenetic mechanisms. Etiology of stroke in COVID-19 patients is likely multifactorial, related to coagulopathy, inflammation, platelet activation, and alterations to the vascular endothelium. Significant work remains to be done to better understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related stroke and for designing optimal primary and secondary prevention strategies.

While the mechanism of action for SARS-CoV-2 is still being understood, how SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts the redox environment in hematologic conditions is unclear. In this review, the redox mechanisms contributing to SARS-CoV-2 infection, coagulopathy and inflammation are briefly discussed. Specifically, sources of oxidant generation by hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells are identified with special emphasis on leukocytes, platelets, red cells, and endothelial cells. Furthermore, reactive cysteines in SARS-CoV-2 are also discussed with respect to oxidative cysteine modification and current therapeutic implications. Lastly, sickle cell disease will be discussed as a hematologic disorder with a pre-existing prothrombotic redox condition that complicates treatment strategies for COVID-19. An understanding of the redox mechanism may identify potential targets for COVID-19-mediated thrombosis in hematologic disorders.

Associated cardiovascular comorbid conditions result in severe to critical illness with mortality up to 14.8 % in octogenarians. The role of endothelial dysfunction in its pathogenesis has been proposed with laboratory and autopsy data, though initially it was thought of as only acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The current study on endothelial dysfunction in SARS CoV-2 infection highlights its pathophysiology through the effects of direct viral-induced endothelial injury, uncontrolled immune & inflammatory response, imbalanced coagulation homeostasis, and their interactions resulting in a vicious cycle aggravating the disease process. This review may provide further light on proper laboratory tests and therapeutic implications needed for better management of patients. The main objective of the study is to understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 with respect to the role of endothelium so that more additional relevant treatment may be incorporated in the management protocol.

Deep learning (DL) techniques have shown promising potential as screening tools for COVID-19 detection. In this study, we explore the realistic development of DL-driven COVID-19 detection methods and focus on the fully automatic framework using available resources, which can effectively investigate various coronavirus variants through modalities. We conducted an exploration and comparison of several diagnostic techniques that are widely used and globally validated for the detection of COVID-19. Furthermore, we explore review-based studies that provide detailed information on synergistic medicine combinations for the treatment of COVID-19. We recommend DL methods that effectively reduce time, cost, and complexity, providing valuable guidance for utilizing available synergistic combinations in clinical and research settings. This study also highlights the implication of innovative diagnostic technical and instrumental strategies, exploring public datasets, and investigating synergistic medicines using optimised DL rules. By summarizing these findings, we aim to assist future researchers in their endeavours by providing a comprehensive overview of the implication of DL techniques in COVID-19 detection and treatment. Integrating DL methods with various diagnostic approaches holds great promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of COVID-19 diagnostics, thus contributing to effective control and management of the ongoing pandemic.

AB  - Summary
SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2) is the most dangerous form of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. In patients with severe COVID-19, the immune system becomes markedly overactive. There is evidence that supplementation with select micronutrients may play a role in maintaining immune system function in this patient population. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, significant emphasis has been placed on the importance of supplementing critical micronutrients such as Vitamin C and Zinc (Zn) due to their immunomodulatory effects. Viral infections, like COVID-19, increase physiological demand for these micronutrients. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to provide comprehensive information regarding the potential effectiveness of Vitamin C and Zn supplementation during viral infection and specifically COVID-19. This review demonstrated a relation between Vitamin C and Zn deficiency and a reduction in the innate immune response, which can ultimately make patients with COVID-19 more vulnerable to viral infection. As such, adequate intake of Vitamin C and Zn, as an adjunctive therapeutic approach with any necessary pharmacological treatment(s), may be necessary to mitigate the adverse physiological effects of COVID-19. To truly clarify the role of Vitamin C and Zn supplementation in the management of COVID-19, we must wait for the results of ongoing randomized controlled trials. The toxicity of Vitamin C and Zn should also be considered to prevent over-supplementation. Over-supplementation of Vitamin C can lead to oxalate toxicity, while increased Zn intake can reduce immune system function. In summary, Vitamin C and Zn supplementation may be useful in mitigating COVID-19 symptomology.

AB  - Micronutrients constitute an adjuvant treatment for respiratory viral infections. Since there is no effective antiviral therapy for COVID-19 yet, adjuvant intervention for the survival of critically ill patients may be significant. Search of the PubMed, CINAHL and Cochrane databases was carried out to find human studies investigating the prognostic role of micronutrient status and the effects of micronutrient supplementation intervention in COVID-19 outcomes of adult patients. Patients with certain comorbidities (diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, renal failure, liver dysfunction etc.) or pregnant women were excluded. 31 studies (27 observational studies and 4 clinical trials) spanning the years 2020–2021, pertaining to 8624 COVID-19 patients (mean age±SD, 61 ± 9 years) were included in this systematic review. Few studies provided direct evidence on the association of serum levels of vitamin D, calcium, zinc, magnesium, phosphorus and selenium to patients' survival or death. Vitamin D and calcium were the most studied micronutrients and those with a probable promising favorable impact on patients. This review highlights the importance of a balanced nutritional status for a favorable outcome in COVID-19. Micronutrients’ deficiency on admission to hospital seems to be related to a high risk for ICU admission, intubation and even death. Nevertheless, evidence for intervention remains unclear.

AB  - The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic’s steady condition coupled with predominance of emerging contaminants in the environment and its synergistic implications in recent times has stoked interest in combating medical emergencies in this dynamic environment. In this context, high concentrations of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), microplastics (MPs), antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and soaring coinfecting microbes, tied with potential endocrine disruptive (ED) are critical environmental concerns that requires a detailed documentation and analysis. During the pandemic, the identification, enumeration, and assessment of potential hazards of PPCPs and MPs and (used as anti-COVID-19 agents/applications) in aquatic habitats have been attempted globally. Albeit receding threats in the magnitude of COVID-19 infections, both these pollutants have still posed serious consequences to aquatic ecosystems and the very health and hygiene of the population in the vicinity. The surge in the contaminants post-COVID also renders them to be potent vectors to harbor and amplify AMR. Pertinently, the present work attempts to critically review such instances to understand the underlying mechanism, interactions swaying the current health of our environment during this post-COVID-19 era. During this juncture, although prevention of diseases, patient care, and self-hygiene have taken precedence, nevertheless antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) efforts have been overlooked. Unnecessary usage of PPCPs and plastics during the pandemic has resulted in increased emerging contaminants (i.e., active pharmaceutical ingredients and MPs) in various environmental matrices. It was also noticed that among COVID-19 patients, while the bacterial co-infection prevalence was 0.2–51%, the fungi, viral, protozoan and helminth were 0.3–49, 1–22, 2–15, 0.4–15% respectively, rendering them resistant to residual PPCPs. There are inevitable chances of ED effects from PPCPs and MPs applied previously, that could pose far-reaching health concerns. Furthermore, clinical and other experimental evidence for many newer compounds is very scarce and demands further research. Pro-active measures targeting effective waste management, evolved environmental policies aiding strict regulatory measures, and scientific research would be crucial in minimizing the impact and creating better preparedness towards such events among the masses fostering sustainability.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to over 100 million infections and over 3 million deaths worldwide. Understanding its pathogenesis is crucial to guide prognostic and therapeutic implications. Viral infections are known to alter the lipid profile and metabolism of their host cells, similar to the case with MERS and SARS-CoV-2002. Since lipids play various metabolic roles, studying lipid profile alterations in COVID-19 is an inevitable step as an attempt to achieve better therapeutic strategies, as well as a potential prognostic factor in the course of this disease. Several studies have reported changes in lipid profile associated with COVID-19. The most frequently reported changes are a decline in serum cholesterol and ApoA1 levels and elevated triglycerides. The hyper-inflammatory state mediated by the Cytokine storm disturbs several fundamental lipid biosynthesis pathways. Virus replication is a process that drastically changes the host cell's lipid metabolism program and overuses cell lipid resources. Lower HDL-C and ApoA1 levels are associated with higher severity and mortality rates and with higher levels of inflammatory markers. Studies suggest that arachidonic acid omega-3 derivatives might help modulate hyper-inflammation and cytokine storm resulting from pulmonary involvement. Also, statins have been shown to be beneficial when administered after COVID-19 diagnosis via unclear mechanisms probably associated with anti-inflammatory effects and HDL-C rising effects.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 virus has attracted a lot of attention globally due to the autoimmune and inflammatory processes that were observed during the development of Covid-19 disease. Excessive activation of immune response and triggering of autoantibodies synthesis as well as an excessive synthesis of inflammatory cytokines and the onset of cytokine storm has a vital role in the disease outcome and the occurring autoimmune complications. This scenario is reminiscent of infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes in specific organs and the increased production of autoantibodies and chemoattractants noted in other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The main goal of this study is to investigate the complex inflammatory processes that occur in Covid-19 disease and to find similarities with other inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Kawasaki syndrome to advance existing diagnostic and therapeutic protocols. The therapy with Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and the use of S1P receptor modulators showed promising results. However, there are many unknowns about these mechanisms and possible novel therapies. Therefore, the inflammation and autoimmunity triggered by Covid-19 should be further investigated to improve existing diagnostic procedures and therapeutic protocols for Covid-19.

AB  - The novel coronavirus 2019 pandemic has become a global health crisis. In an attempt to decipher how kidneys are affected by COVID-19 infection, this review focuses on pathogenic and clinical links between COVID-19 infection and the kidneys. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are target for kidney affection, renal tropism, among other multiorgan complications. COVID-19 related kidney affection is reported not only in infected chronic kidney disease patients but also in those with no prior history of kidney disease. As nephrologists try to keep up with the rapidly evolving, sometimes hasty, reports on renal affection in COVID-19, kidneys continue to be deleteriously affected particularly in critical care settings. This review aims to briefly portray renal involvement in COVID-19 amid this unprecedented deluge of scientific data. Based on gained knowledge and expertise, it is prudent to develop and regularly update preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcome and reduce mortality.

AB  - Since 2019, COVID-19 has become the most important health dilemma around the world. The dysregulated immune response which results in ARDS and cytokine storm has an outstanding role in the progression of pulmonary damage in COVID-19. IL-6, through induction of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, is the pioneer of the hyperinflammatory condition and cytokine storm in severe COVID-19. Therefore, IL-6 pathway blockade is considered an emerging approach with high efficacy to reduce lung damage in COVID-19. This article aims to review the pleiotropic roles of the IL-6 pathway in lung damage and ARDS in severe COVID-19, and the rationale for IL-6 signaling blockade at different levels, including IL-6 soluble and membrane receptor pathways, IL-6 downstream signaling (such as JAK-STAT) inhibition, and non-specific anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches. Recent clinical data of each method, with specific concentration on tocilizumab, along with other new drugs, such as sarilumab and siltuximab, have been discussed. Challenges of IL-6 signaling inhibition, such as the risk of superinfection and hepatic injury, and possible solutions have also been explained. Moreover, to achieve the highest efficacy, ongoing clinical trials and special clinical considerations of using different IL-6 inhibitors have been discussed in detail. Special considerations, including the appropriate timing and dosage, monotherapy or combination therapy, and proper side effect managment must be noticed regarding the clinical administration of these drugs. Future studies are still necessary to improve the productivity and unknown aspects of IL-6 signaling blockade for personalized treatment of severe COVID-19.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the tourism industry worldwide. This study aims to understand the early effects of the pandemic on tourist supply and demand by analysing Airbnb's occupancy rates and accommodation prices at both city and neighborhood/district scales in Madrid and Valencia, two Spanish destinations with distinct tourism types. By considering both spatial and statistical analyses at different scales, this study provides valuable insights into the short-term impacts of COVID-19 on the tourism industry in these destinations. The findings reveal a spatial polarisation, with certain areas maintaining higher occupancy rates and prices, suggesting resilience to the crisis, particularly those near green spaces. The analysis further highlights varied effects of the pandemic across different months and neighborhoods/districts. While historic center neighborhoods experienced declines in both occupancy rates and prices, districts with a stronger tourist tradition showed greater resilience. Price rigidity is observed in some urban areas, where occupancy rates decline while prices remain relatively stable or even increase. Two key recommendations are underscored for decision makers: (1) regulating Airbnb should consider neighborhood-specific characteristics and differentiate between types of tourism, establishing minimum standards for housing conditions and the surrounding environment and (2) touristic cities should aim for a polycentric spatial structure by expanding and diversifying tourist areas, avoiding concentration in a single location.

AB  - Despite anticipated increased risk of COVID-19 and increased expression of the SARS CoV-2 receptor (ACE2), the relatively low mortality of pregnant women with COVID-19 has been an area of wonder. The immunological changes predominantly inclining to anti-inflammatory state, which is augmented by placental hormones’ immune modulating action, looks against with COVID-19 inflammatory reaction leading to cytokine storm and multiple organ failure. Unlike many other viral infections, the bilateral immune activation of COVID-19 may preferentially make pregnant women at low risk. Taking the physiological advantage of pregnant women, potential clinical trials are proposed. Quite a large number of epidemiological and obstetrics related studies have addressed the cases of women with COVID-19. However, to the best of the author's knowledge, little is done to explore the physiological internal milieu of pregnant women in relation to COVID-19. This review provides an insight into how the hormonal and immunological changes in pregnancy potentially reduce SARS-CoV-2-mediated inflammatory response.

Given the high infection rate, it is increasingly likely that histopathologists will encounter this disease during their practice. Although COVID-19 is increasingly recognized as a multi-system disease, the lungs and, to a lesser degree, the heart remain the major sites of pathology. This article aims to acquaint the general histopathologist with the main pathological findings in the lungs and heart of adults with COVID-19. It highlights the need for clinicopathological correlation with a discussion of the cardiopulmonary clinical features in COVID-19 and relates those to the pathological findings. In the lungs, diffuse alveolar damage is emphasized with its variety of morphological appearances over time. It concludes with a discussion of the main techniques available to identify the virus in fixed tissues and their potential limitations related specifically to the heart and lungs.

AB  - Antiphospholipid syndrome and the coagulopathy of COVID-19 share many pathophysiologic features, including endotheliopathy, hypercoagulability, and activation of platelets, complement pathways, and neutrophil extracellular traps, all acting in concert via a model of immunothrombosis. Antiphospholipid antibody production in COVID-19 is common, with 50% of COVID-19 patients being positive for lupus anticoagulant in some studies, and with non-Sapporo criteria antiphospholipid antibodies being prevalent as well. The biological significance of antiphospholipid antibodies in COVID-19 is uncertain, as such antibodies are usually transient, and studies examining clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with and without antiphospholipid antibodies have yielded conflicting results. In this review, we explore the biology of antiphospholipid antibodies in COVID-19 and other infections and discuss mechanisms of thrombogenesis in antiphospholipid syndrome and parallels with COVID-19 coagulopathy. In addition, we review the existing literature on safety of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and antiphospholipid syndrome.

As COVID-19 evolves from a pandemic to an endemic disease, the already staggering number of people that have been or will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 is only destined to increase, and the majority of humanity will be infected. It is well understood that COVID-19, like many other viral infections, leaves a significant fraction of the infected with prolonged consequences. Continued high number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, viral evolution with escape from post-infection and vaccinal immunity, and reinfections heighten the potential impact of Long COVID. Hence, the impact of COVID-19 on human health will be seen for years to come until more effective vaccines and pharmaceutical treatments become available. To that effect, it is imperative that the mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of Long COVID be elucidated. In this article, we provide an in-depth analysis of the evidence on several potential mechanisms of Long COVID and discuss their relevance to its pathogenesis.

AB  - COVID-19 has exposed major weaknesses in the healthcare settings. The surge in COVID-19 cases increases the demands of health care, endangers vulnerable patients, and threats occupational safety. In contrast to a hospital outbreak of SARS leading to a whole hospital quarantined, at least 54 hospital outbreaks following a COVID-19 surge in the community were controlled by strengthened infection prevention and control measures for preventing transmission from community to hospitals as well as within hospitals. Access control measures include establishing triage, epidemic clinics, and outdoor quarantine stations. Visitor access restriction is applied to inpatients to limit the number of visitors. Health monitoring and surveillance is applied to healthcare personnel, including self-reporting travel declaration, temperature, predefined symptoms, and test results. Isolation of the confirmed cases during the contagious period and quarantine of the close contacts during the incubation period are critical for containment. The target populations and frequency of SARS-CoV-2 PCR and rapid antigen testing depend on the level of transmission. Case investigation and contact tracing should be comprehensive to identify the close contacts to prevent further transmission. These facility-based infection prevention and control strategies help reduce hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to a minimum in Taiwan.

AB  - Summary
The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) conveys a serious global threat to health and economy. A common predisposing factor for development to serious progressive disease is presence of a low-grade inflammation, e.g., as seen in diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and heart failure. Micronutrient deficiencies may also contribute to the development of this state. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to explore the role of the nutrition to relieve progression of COVID-19. According PRISMA protocol, we conducted an online databases search including Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar and web of science for published literatures in the era of COVID-19 Outbreak regarding to the status of nutrition and COVID-19 until December 2021. There were available studies (80 studies) providing direct evidence regarding the associations between the status of nutrition and COVID-19 infection. Adequate nutritional supply is essential for resistance against other viral infections and also for improvement of immune function and reduction of inflammation. Hence, it is suggested that nutritional intervention which secures an adequate status might protect against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - coronavirus-2) and mitigate its course. We also recommend initiation of adequate nutritional supplementation in high-risk areas and/or soon after the time of suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2. Subjects in high-risk groups should have high priority for applying this nutritive adjuvant therapy that should be started prior to administration of specific and supportive medical measures.

AB  - Viral infections are a continuing global burden on the human population, underscored by the ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Current treatment options and supportive therapies for many viral infections are relatively limited, indicating a need for alternative therapeutic approaches. Virus-induced damage occurs through direct infection of host cells and inflammation-related changes. Severe cases of certain viral infections, including COVID-19, can lead to a hyperinflammatory response termed cytokine storm, resulting in extensive endothelial damage, thrombosis, respiratory failure, and death. Therapies targeting these complications are crucial in addition to antiviral therapies. Nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide are two endogenous gasotransmitters that have emerged as key signaling molecules with a broad range of antiviral actions in addition to having anti-inflammatory properties and protective functions in the vasculature and respiratory system. The enhancement of endogenous nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide levels thus holds promise for managing both early-stage and later-stage viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a model for similar viral infections, here we explore the current evidence regarding nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide's use to limit viral infection, resolve inflammation, and reduce vascular and pulmonary damage.

AB  - Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causes direct damage to the airway epithelium, enabling aspergillus invasion. Reports of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis have raised concerns about it worsening the disease course of COVID-19 and increasing mortality. Additionally, the first cases of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis caused by azole-resistant aspergillus have been reported. This article constitutes a consensus statement on defining and managing COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis, prepared by experts and endorsed by medical mycology societies. COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis is proposed to be defined as possible, probable, or proven on the basis of sample validity and thus diagnostic certainty. Recommended first-line therapy is either voriconazole or isavuconazole. If azole resistance is a concern, then liposomal amphotericin B is the drug of choice. Our aim is to provide definitions for clinical research and up-to-date recommendations for clinical management of the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis.

AB  - Selenium is an indispensable trace element for all living organisms. It is an essential structural component of several selenium-dependent enzymes, which support the human body’s defense mechanism. Recently, the significance of selenium in preventing/treating COVID-19 has been documented in the literature. This review highlights the clinical studies, compositions, and patent literature on selenium to prevent/treat COVID-19. Selenium exerts its anti-COVID-19 action by reducing oxidative stress, declining the expression of the ACE-2 receptor, lowering the discharge of pro-inflammatory substances, and inhibiting the 3CLPro (main protease) and PLpro enzyme of SARS-CoV-2. The data of clinical studies, inventive compositions, and patent literature revealed that selenium monotherapy and its compositions with other nutritional supplements/drugs (vitamin, iron, zinc, copper, ferulic acid, resveratrol, spirulina, N-acetylcysteine, fish oil, many herbs, doxycycline, azithromycin, curcumin, quercetin, etc.,) might be practical to prevent/treat COVID-19. The studies have also suggested a correlation between COVID-19 and selenium deficiency. This indicates that adequate selenium supplementation may provide promising treatment outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The authors foresee the development and commercialization of Selenium-based compositions and dosage forms (spray, inhalers, control release dosage forms, etc.) to battle COVID-19. We also trust that numerous selenium-based compositions are yet to be explored. Accordingly, there is good scope for scientists to work on developing novel and inventive selenium-based compositions to fight against COVID-19. However, there is also a need to consider the narrow therapeutic window and chemical interaction of selenium before developing selenium-based compositions.

AB  - Summary
Kidney involvement is common in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), and our understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on short- and long-term kidney outcomes has evolved over the course of the pandemic. Initial key questions centered on the spectrum and degree of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Investigators worldwide have explored the association between COVID-19–associated AKI and short-term outcomes, including inpatient mortality and disease severity. Even as treatments evolved, vaccinations were developed, and newer viral variants arose, subsets of patients were identified as at continued high risk for major adverse kidney outcomes. In this review, we explore key topics of continued relevance including the following: (1) a comparison of COVID-19–associated AKI with AKI developing in other clinical settings; (2) the ongoing controversy over kidney tropism in the setting of COVID-19 and the potential for competitive binding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 to prevent viral cell entry; and (3) the identification of high-risk patients for adverse outcomes to inform long-term outpatient management. Patients at particularly high risk for adverse kidney outcomes include those with APOL1 high-risk genotype status. Biomarkers of injury, inflammation, tubular health, and repair measured in both the blood and urine may hold prognostic significance.

AB  - Worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare services, including cervical cancer management, and an increased burden for this condition is expected. This systematic review synthetizes the available evidence on the impact of the pandemic on prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer. Searches were performed on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for relevant studies on these topics with the purpose of comparing service access and care delivery before and during COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the methodological heterogeneity among the studies, findings were narratively discussed. Of the 715 screened titles and abstracts, 33 articles were included, corresponding to 42 reports that covered the outcomes of interest: vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) (6 reports), cancer screening (19), diagnosis (8), and treatment (8). Seven studies observed reductions in HPV vaccination uptake and coverage during COVID-19. Reports on cervical screening and cancer diagnosis activities showed a substantial impact of the pandemic on access to screening services and diagnostic procedures. All but one study that investigated cervical cancer treatment reported changes in the number of women with cervical lesions who received treatments, as well as treatment delay and interruption. With a major impact during the first wave in 2020, COVID-19 and restriction measures resulted in a substantial disruption in cervical cancer prevention and management, with declines in screening and delays in treatment. Taken together, findings from this systematic review calls for urgent policy interventions for recovering cervical cancer prevention and care.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a coronavirus-induced illness attributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, is thought to have first emerged on November 17, 2019. According to World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 has been linked to 379,223,560 documented occurrences and 5,693,245 fatalities globally as of 1st Feb 2022. Influenza A virus that has also been discovered diarrhea and gastrointestinal discomfort was found in the infected person, highlighting the need of monitoring them for gastro intestinal tract (GIT) symptoms regardless of whether the sickness is respiration related. The majority of the microbiome in the intestines is Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, while Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes are found in the lungs. Although most people overcome SARS-CoV-2 infections, many people continue to have symptoms months after the original sickness, called Long-COVID or Post COVID. The term “post-COVID-19 symptoms” refers to those that occur with or after COVID-19 and last for more than 12 weeks (long-COVID-19). The possible understanding of biological components such as inflammatory, immunological, metabolic activity biomarkers in peripheral blood is needed to evaluate the study. Therefore, this article aims to review the informative data that supports the idea underlying the disruption mechanisms of the microbiome of the gastrointestinal tract in the acute COVID-19 or post-COVID-mediated elevation of severity biomarkers.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection evokes severe proinflammatory storm and pulmonary infection with the number of confirmed cases (more than 200 million) and mortality (5 million) continue to surge globally. A number of vaccines (e.g., Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson/Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines) have been developed over the past two years to restrain the rapid spread of COVID-19. However, without much of effective drug therapies, COVID-19 continues to cause multiple irreversible organ injuries and is drawing intensive attention for cell therapy in the management of organ damage in this devastating COVID-19 pandemic. For example, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have exhibited promising results in COVID-19 patients. Preclinical and clinical findings have favored the utility of stem cells in the management of COVID-19-induced adverse outcomes via inhibition of cytokine storm and hyperinflammatory syndrome with coinstantaneous tissue regeneration capacity. In this review, we will discuss the existing data with regards to application of stem cells for COVID-19.

AB  - The global anxiety and economic crisis causes the deadly pandemic coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID 19) affect millions of people right now. Subsequently, this life threatened viral disease is caused due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, morbidity and mortality of infected patients are due to cytokines storm syndrome associated with lung injury and multiorgan failure caused by COVID 19. Thereafter, several methodological advances have been approved by WHO and US-FDA for the detection, diagnosis and control of this wide spreadable communicable disease but still facing multi-challenges to control. Herein, we majorly emphasize the current trends and future perspectives of nano-medicinal based approaches for the delivery of anti-COVID 19 therapeutic moieties. Interestingly, Nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with drug molecules or vaccines resemble morphological features of SARS-CoV-2 in their size (60–140 nm) and shape (circular or spherical) that particularly mimics the virus facilitating strong interaction between them. Indeed, the delivery of anti-COVID 19 cargos via a nanoparticle such as Lipidic nanoparticles, Polymeric nanoparticles, Metallic nanoparticles, and Multi-functionalized nanoparticles to overcome the drawbacks of conventional approaches, specifying the site-specific targeting with reduced drug loading and toxicities, exhibit their immense potential. Additionally, nano-technological based drug delivery with their peculiar characteristics of having low immunogenicity, tunable drug release, multidrug delivery, higher selectivity and specificity, higher efficacy and tolerability switch on the novel pathway for the prevention and treatment of COVID 19.

AB  - COVID-19 disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and quickly became the global pandemic. The high spread rate, relatively high mortality rate, and the lack of specific medicine have led researchers and clinicians worldwide to find new treatment strategies. Unfortunately, evidence shows that the virus-specific receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) is present on the surface of most cells in the body, leading to immune system dysfunction and multi-organ failure in critically ill patients. In this context, the use of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) and their secret has opened new therapeutic horizons for patients due to the lack of ACE2 receptor expression. MSCs exert their beneficial therapeutic actions, particularly anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, mainly through paracrine effects which are mediated by exosomes. Exosomes are bilayer nanovesicles that carry a unique cargo of proteins, lipids and functional nucleic acids based on their cell origin. This review article aims to investigate the possible role of exosomes and the underlying mechanism involved in treating COVID-19 disease based on recent findings.

AB  - After five waves of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks, it has been recognized that a significant portion of the affected individuals developed long-term debilitating symptoms marked by chronic fatigue, cognitive difficulties (“brain fog”), post-exertional malaise, and autonomic dysfunction. The onset, progression, and clinical presentation of this condition, generically named post-COVID-19 syndrome, overlap significantly with another enigmatic condition, referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Several pathobiological mechanisms have been proposed for ME/CFS, including redox imbalance, systemic and central nervous system inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Chronic inflammation and glial pathological reactivity are common hallmarks of several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders and have been consistently associated with reduced central and peripheral levels of plasmalogens, one of the major phospholipid components of cell membranes with several homeostatic functions. Of great interest, recent evidence revealed a significant reduction of plasmalogen contents, biosynthesis, and metabolism in ME/CFS and acute COVID-19, with a strong association to symptom severity and other relevant clinical outcomes. These bioactive lipids have increasingly attracted attention due to their reduced levels representing a common pathophysiological manifestation between several disorders associated with aging and chronic inflammation. However, alterations in plasmalogen levels or their lipidic metabolism have not yet been examined in individuals suffering from post-COVID-19 symptoms. Here, we proposed a pathobiological model for post-COVID-19 and ME/CFS based on their common inflammation and dysfunctional glial reactivity, and highlighted the emerging implications of plasmalogen deficiency in the underlying mechanisms. Along with the promising outcomes of plasmalogen replacement therapy (PRT) for various neurodegenerative/neuropsychiatric disorders, we sought to propose PRT as a simple, effective, and safe strategy for the potential relief of the debilitating symptoms associated with ME/CFS and post-COVID-19 syndrome.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and its variants have brought unprecedented impacts to the global public health system, politics, economy, and other fields. Although more than ten COVID-19 specific vaccines have been approved for emergency use, COVID-19 prevention and control still face many challenges. Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) is the only authorized vaccine used to fight against tuberculosis (TB), it has been hypothesized that BCG may prevent and control COVID-19 based on BCG-induced nonspecific immune responses. Herein, we summarized: 1) The nonspecific protection effects of BCG, such as prophylactic protection effects of BCG on nonmycobacterial infections, immunotherapy effects of BCG vaccine, and enhancement effect of BCG vaccine on unrelated vaccines; 2) Recent evidence of BCG's efficacy against SARS-COV-2 infection from ecological studies, analytical analyses, clinical trials, and animal studies; 3) Three possible mechanisms of BCG vaccine and their effects on COVID-19 control including heterologous immunity, trained immunity, and anti-inflammatory effect. We hope that this review will encourage more scientists to investigate further BCG induced non-specific immune responses and explore their mechanisms, which could be a potential tool for addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19-like “Black Swan” events to reduce the impacts of infectious disease outbreaks on public health, politics, and economy.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 or most commonly known as COVID-19 is a trending global infectious disease which a few months ago was affirmed as a global health emergency or a pandemic by the WHO Emergency Committee. The common symptoms manifested in this pandemic disease are high grade fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and flu like symptom which can evolve into severe respiratory disorders such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or end-organ failure. Factors that contribute to the severity or high mortality rate in COVID-19 include old age, comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, neutrophilia, and organ and coagulation dysfunction. Disseminated intravascular coagulation and other various coagulopathies including Venous thromboembolism have known to become a major contributing factor to high mortality rate. Venous thromboembolism is a disease which is a combination of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Prophylactic anticoagulation in patients prone to or with a pre-existing history of venous thromboembolism is associated with decreased mortality in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This review article focuses upon COVID-19 and increased incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients infected by COVID-19 along with the role it has in high mortality rate in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Objectives
The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented health crisis resulting in over 6 million deaths worldwide, a figure, which continues to grow. In addition to the excess mortality, there are individuals who recovered from the acute stages, but suffered long-term changes in their health post COVID-19, commonly referred to as long COVID. It is estimated there are currently 1.8 million long COVID sufferers by May 2022 in the UK alone. The aim of this narrative literature review is to explore the signs, symptoms and diagnosis of long COVID and the potential impact on imaging services.
Key findings
Long COVID is estimated to occur in 9.5% of those with two doses of vaccination and 14.6% if those with a single dose or no vaccination. Long COVID is defined by ongoing symptoms lasting for 12 or more weeks post acute infection. Symptoms are associated with reductions in the quality of daily life and may involve multisystem manifestations or present as a single symptom.
Conclusion
The full impact of long COVID on imaging services is yet to be realised, but there is likely to be significant increased demand for imaging, particularly in CT for the assessment of lung disease. Educators will need to include aspects related to long COVID pathophysiology and imaging presentations in curricula, underpinned by the rapidly evolving evidence base.
Implications for practice
Symptoms relating to long COVID are likely to become a common reason for imaging, with a particular burden on Computed Tomography services. Planning, education and updating protocols in line with a rapidly emerging evidence base is going to be essential.

AB  - In severe COVID-19, the levels of iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se), do not only regulate host immune responses, but modify the viral genome, as well. While low serum Fe concentration is an independent risk factor for the increased death rate, Zn controls oxidative stress, synthesis of inflammatory cytokines and viral replication. Therefore, Zn deficiency associates with a worse prognosis. Although Cu exposure inactivates the viral genome and exhibits spike protein dispersal, increase in Cu/Zn due to high serum Cu levels, are correlated with enhanced risk of infections. Se levels are significantly higher in surviving COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, both Zn and Se suppress the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Since the balance between the deficiency and oversupply of these metals due to a reciprocal relationship, has decisive effect on the prognosis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, monitoring their concentrations may facilitate improved outcomes for patients suffering from COVID-19.
