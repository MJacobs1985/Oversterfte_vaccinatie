AB  - Background
Nurses have been identified as an occupational group at increased risk of suicide. This systematic review examines the prevalence of, and factors influencing, suicide and related behaviours among nurses and midwives (PROSPERO pre-registration CRD42021270297).
Methods
MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched. Articles published from 1996 onwards exploring suicidal thoughts and behaviours among nurses and midwives were included. Quality of included studies was assessed. Articles were subjected to narrative synthesis informed by suicide data examined, study design, and quality. PRISMA guidelines were followed.
Results
A total of 100 studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. Articles examining suicide exclusively among midwives were absent from the literature. Several studies confirmed that nursing professionals, especially female, are at increased risk of suicide, particularly by self-poisoning. Factors contributing to risk include psychiatric disorders, alcohol and substance misuse, physical health problems, and occupational and interpersonal difficulties. In studies of non-fatal suicidal behaviours, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, psychiatric, psychological, physical and occupational factors were contributory. There has been little investigation of interventions for prevention of suicide in nurses.
Limitations
Only articles published in English language were reviewed.
Conclusions
The findings highlight the risk of suicide in nurses. They also show a combination of factors contribute to suicide and non-fatal suicidal behaviour in nurses, with psychiatric, psychological, physical health, occupational and substance misuse (especially alcohol) problems being particularly important. The limited evidence regarding prevention measures indicates a major need to develop primary and secondary interventions for this at-risk occupational group, for example, education regarding enhancing wellbeing and safe alcohol use, alongside accessible psychological support.

AB  - Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a well-established treatment for patients with medically inoperable early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pulmonary oligometastases. The use of single-fraction SABR in this setting is supported by excellent local control and safety profiles which appear equivalent to multi-fraction SABR based on the available data. The resource efficiency and reduction in hospital outpatient visits associated with single-fraction SABR have been particularly advantageous during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the increased interest, single-fraction SABR in subgroups of patients remains controversial, including those with centrally located tumours, synchronous targets, proximity to dose-limiting organs at risk, and concomitant severe respiratory illness. This review provides an overview of the published randomised evidence evaluating single-fraction SABR in primary lung cancer and pulmonary oligometastases, the common clinical challenges faced, immunogenic effect of SABR, as well as technical and cost-utility considerations.

AB  - Gastroduodenal inflammation and ulcerative injuries are increasing due to expanding socio-economic stress, unhealthy food habits-lifestyle, smoking, alcoholism and usage of medicines like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In fact, gastrointestinal (GI) complications, associated with the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic, further, poses a challenge to global healthcare towards safeguarding the GI tract. Emerging evidences have discretely identified mitochondrial dysfunctions as common etiological denominators in diseases. However, it is worth realizing that mitochondrial dysfunctions are not just consequences of diseases. Rather, damaged mitochondria severely aggravate the pathogenesis thereby qualifying as perpetrable factors worth of prophylactic and therapeutic targeting. Oxidative and nitrosative stress due to endogenous and exogenous stimuli triggers mitochondrial injury causing production of mitochondrial damage associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), which, in a feed-forward loop, inflicts inflammatory tissue damage. Mitochondrial structural dynamics and mitophagy are crucial quality control parameters determining the extent of mitopathology and disease outcomes. Interestingly, apart from endogenous factors, mitochondria also crosstalk and in turn get detrimentally affected by gut pathobionts colonized during luminal dysbiosis. Although mitopathology is documented in various pre-clinical/clinical studies, a comprehensive account appreciating the mitochondrial basis of GI mucosal pathogenesis is largely lacking. Here we critically discuss the molecular events impinging on mitochondria along with the interplay of mitochondria-derived factors in fueling mucosal damage. We specifically emphasize on the potential role of aberrant mitochondrial dynamics, anomalous mitophagy, mitochondrial lipoxidation and ferroptosis as emerging regulators of GI mucosal pathogenesis. We finally discuss about the prospect of mitochondrial targeting for next-generation drug discovery against GI disorders.

AB  - Diesel exhaust particles (DEP) are the major components of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) and chronic exposure is recognized to enhance respiratory system complications. Although the spread of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be associated with the PMs, the mechanism by which exposure to DEP increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still under discussion. However, diesel fine PM (dPM) elevate the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it coincides with the increase in the number of ACE2 receptors. Expression of ACE2 and its colocalized activator, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the alveolar epithelial cells exposed to dPM. Thus, the coexistence of PM and SARS-CoV-2 in the environment augments inflammation and exacerbates lung damage. Increased TGF-β1 expression due to DEP accompanies the proliferation of the extracellular matrix. In this case, “multifocal ground-glass opacity” (GGO) in a CT scan is an indication of a cytokine storm and severe pneumonia in COVID-19.

AB  - Dexamethasone has been widely used in clinical practice to promote fetal lung maturity and reduce neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and perinatal mortality. Nevertheless, its administration is a double-edged sword, as a large number of studies have shown that there are obvious disadvantages in pregnant women and fetal development. In this review, we comprehensively retrospect the latest literature on the toxicological effects and mechanisms of dexamethasone on fetal development, in an attempt to provide a valuable basis for further studies and clinical trials in the future. Overall, prenatal dexamethasone exposure could lead to some adverse consequences on fetal organ systems through intrauterine programming based on the results of current animal and human researches. Potential sequelae include osteoarthritis, hypertension, fatty liver, glomerulosclerosis, depression, diabetes and infertility, some of which can pass on to the next generation. It must be noted that the evidence in humans is preliminary and limited by the small sample size. More studies in large-scale populations are needed to confirm if it raises the risk of sequelae in humans. In addition, we strongly support the application of dexamethasone as a pharmaceutical therapy in pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 before a better therapy is developed. However, the adverse side effects that may arise also cannot be ignored.

AB  - Recent advances in ultrasound (US) have shown its great potential in biomedical applications as diagnostic and therapeutic tools. The coupling of US-assisted drug delivery systems with nanobiomaterials possessing tailor-made functions has been shown to remove the limitations of conventional drug delivery systems. The low-frequency US has significantly enhanced the targeted drug delivery effect and efficacy, reducing limitations posed by conventional treatments such as a limited therapeutic window. The acoustic cavitation effect induced by the US-mediated microbubbles (MBs) has been reported to replace drugs in certain acute diseases such as ischemic stroke. This review briefly discusses the US principles, with particular attention to the recent advancements in drug delivery applications. Furthermore, US-assisted drug delivery coupled with nanobiomaterials to treat different diseases (cancer, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, thrombosis, and COVID-19) are discussed in detail. Finally, this review covers the future perspectives and challenges on the applications of US-mediated nanobiomaterials.

AB  - The innate immune system acts as the first line of defense against pathogens, including coronaviruses (CoVs). Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV are epidemic zoonotic CoVs that emerged at the beginning of the 21st century. The recently emerged virus SARS-CoV-2 is a novel strain of CoV that has caused the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Scientific advancements made by studying the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks have provided a foundation for understanding pathogenesis and innate immunity against SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we focus on our present understanding of innate immune responses, inflammasome activation, inflammatory cell death pathways, and cytokine secretion during SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discuss how the pathogenesis of these viruses influences these biological processes.

AB  - Metformin was first used to treat type 2 diabetes in the late 1950s and in 2022 remains the first-choice drug used daily by approximately 150 million people. An accumulation of positive pre-clinical and clinical data has stimulated interest in re-purposing metformin to treat a variety of diseases including COVID-19. In polycystic ovary syndrome metformin improves insulin sensitivity. In type 1 diabetes metformin may help reduce the insulin dose. Meta-analysis and data from pre-clinical and clinical studies link metformin to a reduction in the incidence of cancer. Clinical trials, including MILES (Metformin In Longevity Study), and TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin), have been designed to determine if metformin can offset aging and extend lifespan. Pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that metformin, via suppression of pro-inflammatory pathways, protection of mitochondria and vascular function, and direct actions on neuronal stem cells, may protect against neurodegenerative diseases. Metformin has also been studied for its anti-bacterial, −viral, −malaria efficacy. Collectively, these data raise the question: Is metformin a drug for all diseases? It remains unclear as to whether all of these putative beneficial effects are secondary to its actions as an anti-hyperglycemic and insulin-sensitizing drug, or result from other cellular actions, including inhibition of mTOR (mammalian target for rapamycin), or direct anti-viral actions. Clarification is also sought as to whether data from ex vivo studies based on the use of high concentrations of metformin can be translated into clinical benefits, or whether they reflect a ‘Paracelsus’ effect. The environmental impact of metformin, a drug with no known metabolites, is another emerging issue that has been linked to endocrine disruption in fish, and extensive use in T2D has also raised concerns over effects on human reproduction. The objectives for this review are to: 1) evaluate the putative mechanism(s) of action of metformin; 2) analyze the controversial evidence for metformin's effectiveness in the treatment of diseases other than type 2 diabetes; 3) assess the reproducibility of the data, and finally 4) reach an informed conclusion as to whether metformin is a drug for all diseases and reasons. We conclude that the primary clinical benefits of metformin result from its insulin-sensitizing and antihyperglycaemic effects that secondarily contribute to a reduced risk of a number of diseases and thereby enhancing healthspan. However, benefits like improving vascular endothelial function that are independent of effects on glucose homeostasis add to metformin's therapeutic actions.

AB  - Summary
Cancer research is a crucial pillar for countries to deliver more affordable, higher quality, and more equitable cancer care. Patients treated in research-active hospitals have better outcomes than patients who are not treated in these settings. However, cancer in Europe is at a crossroads. Cancer was already a leading cause of premature death before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the disastrous effects of the pandemic on early diagnosis and treatment will probably set back cancer outcomes in Europe by almost a decade. Recognising the pivotal importance of research not just to mitigate the pandemic today, but to build better European cancer services and systems for patients tomorrow, the Lancet Oncology European Groundshot Commission on cancer research brings together a wide range of experts, together with detailed new data on cancer research activity across Europe during the past 12 years. We have deployed this knowledge to help inform Europe's Beating Cancer Plan and the EU Cancer Mission, and to set out an evidence-driven, patient-centred cancer research roadmap for Europe. The high-resolution cancer research data we have generated show current activities, captured through different metrics, including by region, disease burden, research domain, and effect on outcomes. We have also included granular data on research collaboration, gender of researchers, and research funding. The inclusion of granular data has facilitated the identification of areas that are perhaps overemphasised in current cancer research in Europe, while also highlighting domains that are underserved. Our detailed data emphasise the need for more information-driven and data-driven cancer research strategies and planning going forward. A particular focus must be on central and eastern Europe, because our findings emphasise the widening gap in cancer research activity, and capacity and outcomes, compared with the rest of Europe. Citizens and patients, no matter where they are, must benefit from advances in cancer research. This Commission also highlights that the narrow focus on discovery science and biopharmaceutical research in Europe needs to be widened to include such areas as prevention and early diagnosis; treatment modalities such as radiotherapy and surgery; and a larger concentration on developing a research and innovation strategy for the 20 million Europeans living beyond a cancer diagnosis. Our data highlight the important role of comprehensive cancer centres in driving the European cancer research agenda. Crucial to a functioning cancer research strategy and its translation into patient benefit is the need for a greater emphasis on health policy and systems research, including implementation science, so that the innovative technological outputs from cancer research have a clear pathway to delivery. This European cancer research Commission has identified 12 key recommendations within a call to action to reimagine cancer research and its implementation in Europe. We hope this call to action will help to achieve our ambitious 70:35 target: 70% average 10-year survival for all European cancer patients by 2035.

AB  - Metformin is the most widely known anti-hyperglycemic, officially acquired by the USA government in 1995 and in 2001 it became the most prescribed treatment for type II diabetes. But how did it become the must-use drug for this disease in such a short period of time? it all started with traditional medicine, by using a plant known as “goat’s rue” for the reduction of blood glucose levels. Its use arose in 1918 and evolved to the metformin synthesis in laboratories a couple of years later, using very rudimentary methods which involved melting and strong heating. Thus, a first synthetic route that allowed the preparation of the initial metformin derivates was established. Some of these resulted toxics, and others outperformed the metformin, reducing the blood glucose levels in such efficient way. Nevertheless, the risk and documented cases of lactic acidosis increased with metformin derivatives like buformin and phenformin. Recently, metformin has been widely studied, and it has been associated and tested in the treatment of type II diabetes, cancer, polycystic ovarian syndrome, cell differentiation to oligodendrocytes, reduction of oxidative stress in cells, weight reduction, as anti-inflammatory and even in the recent COVID-19 disease. Herein we briefly review and analyze the history, synthesis, and biological applications of metformin and its derivates.

AB  - Human infectious diseases caused by various microbial pathogens, in general, impact a large population of individuals every year. These microbial diseases that spread quickly remain to be a big issue in various health-related domains and to withstand the negative drug impacts, the antimicrobial-resistant pathogenic microbial organisms (pathogenic bacteria and pathogenic fungi) have developed a variety of resistance processes against many antimicrobial drug classes. During the COVID-19 outbreak, there seems to be an upsurge in drug and multidrug resistant-associated pathogenic microbial species. The preponderance of existing antimicrobials isn’t completely effective, which limits their application in clinical settings. Several naturally occurring chemicals produced from bacteria, plants, animals, marine species, and other sources are now being studied for antimicrobial characteristics. These natural antimicrobial compounds extracted from different sources have been demonstrated to be effective against a variety of diseases, although plants remain the most abundant source. These compounds have shown promise in reducing the microbial diseases linked to the development of drug tolerance and resistance. This paper offers a detailed review of some of the most vital and promising natural compounds and their derivatives against various human infectious microbial organisms. The inhibitory action of different natural antimicrobial compounds, and their possible mechanism of antimicrobial action against a range of pathogenic fungal and bacterial organisms, is provided. The review will be useful in refining current antimicrobial (antifungal and antibacterial) medicines as well as establishing new treatment strategies to tackle the rising number of human bacterial and fungal-associated infections.

AB  - Metformin is the most commonly prescribed oral antidiabetic medication. Direct/indirect activation of Adenosine Monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and non-AMPK pathways, amongst others, are deemed to explain the molecular mechanisms of action of metformin. Metformin is an established insulin receptor sensitising antihyperglycemic agent, is highly affordable, and has superior safety and efficacy profiles. Emerging experimental and clinical evidence suggests that metformin has pleiotropic non-glycemic effects. Metformin appears to have weight stabilising, renoprotective, neuroprotective, cardio-vascular protective, and antineoplastic effects and mitigates polycystic ovarian syndrome. Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of metformin seem to qualify it as an adjunct therapy in treating infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, and the current novel Covid-19 infections. So far, metformin is the only prescription medicine relevant to the emerging field of senotherapeutics. Non-glycemic effects of metformin favourable to its repurposing in therapeutic use are hereby discussed.

AB  - Preeclampsia is one of the “great obstetrical syndromes” in which multiple and sometimes overlapping pathologic processes activate a common pathway consisting of endothelial cell activation, intravascular inflammation, and syncytiotrophoblast stress. This article reviews the potential etiologies of preeclampsia. The role of uteroplacental ischemia is well-established on the basis of a solid body of clinical and experimental evidence. A causal role for microorganisms has gained recognition through the realization that periodontal disease and maternal gut dysbiosis are linked to atherosclerosis, thus possibly to a subset of patients with preeclampsia. The recent reports indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infection might be causally linked to preeclampsia are reviewed along with the potential mechanisms involved. Particular etiologic factors, such as the breakdown of maternal-fetal immune tolerance (thought to account for the excess of preeclampsia in primipaternity and egg donation), may operate, in part, through uteroplacental ischemia, whereas other factors such as placental aging may operate largely through syncytiotrophoblast stress. This article also examines the association between gestational diabetes mellitus and maternal obesity with preeclampsia. The role of autoimmunity, fetal diseases, and endocrine disorders is discussed. A greater understanding of the etiologic factors of preeclampsia is essential to improve treatment and prevention.

AB  - Living organisms have evolved within the natural electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of the earth which comprise the global atmospheric electrical circuit, Schumann resonances (SRs) and the geomagnetic field. Research suggests that the circadian rhythm, which controls several physiological functions in the human body, can be influenced by light but also by the earth's EMFs. Cyclic solar disturbances, including sunspots and seasonal weakening of the geomagnetic field, can affect human health, possibly by disrupting the circadian rhythm and downstream physiological functions. Severe disruption of the circadian rhythm increases inflammation which can induce fatigue, fever and flu-like symptoms in a fraction of the population and worsen existing symptoms in old and diseased individuals, leading to periodic spikes of infectious and chronic diseases. Possible mechanisms underlying sensing of the earth's EMFs involve entrainment via electrons and electromagnetic waves, light-dependent radical pair formation in retina cryptochromes, and paramagnetic magnetite nanoparticles. Factors such as electromagnetic pollution from wireless devices, base antennas and low orbit internet satellites, shielding by non-conductive materials used in shoes and buildings, and local geomagnetic anomalies may also affect sensing of the earth's EMFs by the human body and contribute to circadian rhythm disruption and disease development.

AB  - Population genetic studies have clearly indicated that immunity and host defense are among the functions most frequently subject to natural selection, and increased our understanding of the biological relevance of the corresponding genes and their contribution to variable immune traits and diseases. Herein, we will focus on some recently studied forms of human adaptation to infectious agents, including hybridization with now-extinct hominins, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, and admixture between modern human populations. These studies, which are partly enabled by the technological advances in the sequencing of DNA from ancient remains, provide new insight into the sources of immune response variation in contemporary humans, such as the recently reported link between Neanderthal heritage and susceptibility to severe COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, ancient DNA analyses, in both humans and pathogens, allow to measure the action of natural selection on immune genes across time and to reconstruct the impact of past epidemics on the evolution of human immunity.

AB  - GM-CSF acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine and a key growth factor produced by several immune cells such as macrophages and activated T cells. In this review, we discuss recent studies that point to the crucial role of GM-CSF in the immune response against infections. Upon induction, GM-CSF activates four main signalling networks including the JAK/STAT, PI3K, MAPK, and NFκB pathways. Many of these transduction pathways such as JAK/STAT signal via proteins commonly activated with other antiviral signalling cascades, such as those induced by IFNs. GM-CSF also helps defend against respiratory infections by regulating alveolar macrophage differentiation and enhancing innate immunity in the lungs. Here, we also summarize the numerous clinical trials that have taken advantage of GM-CSF’s mechanistic attributes in immunotherapy. Moreover, we discuss how GM-CSF is used as an adjuvant in vaccines and how its activity is interfered with to reduce inflammation such as in the case of COVID-19. This review brings forth the current knowledge on the antiviral actions of GM-CSF, the associated signalling cascades, and its application in immunotherapy.

AB  - Summary
Europeans are not only exposed to direct effects from climate change, but also vulnerable to indirect effects from infectious disease, many of which are climate sensitive, which is of concern because of their epidemic potential. Climatic conditions have facilitated vector-borne disease outbreaks like chikungunya, dengue, and West Nile fever and have contributed to a geographic range expansion of tick vectors that transmit Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. Extreme precipitation events have caused waterborne outbreaks and longer summer seasons have contributed to increases in foodborne diseases. Under the Green Deal, The European Union aims to support climate change health policy, in order to be better prepared for the next health security threat, particularly in the aftermath of the traumatic COVID-19 experience. To bolster this policy process we discuss climate change-related hazards, exposures and vulnerabilities to infectious disease and describe observed impacts, projected risks, with policy entry points for adaptation to reduce these risks or avoid them altogether.

AB  - Consumption of pathogenic contaminated water has claimed the lives of many people. Hence, this scenario has emphasized the urgent need for research methods to avoid, treat and eliminate harmful pathogens in wastewater. Therefore, effective water treatment has become a matter of utmost importance. Membrane technology offers purer, cleaner, and pathogen-free water through the water separation method via a permeable membrane. Advanced membrane technology such as nanocomposite membrane, membrane distillation, membrane bioreactor, and photocatalytic membrane reactor can offer synergistic effects in removing pathogen through the integration of additional functionality and filtration in a single chamber. This paper also comprehensively discussed the application, challenges, and future perspective of the advanced membrane technology as a promising alternative in battling pathogenic microbial contaminants, which will also be beneficial and valuable in managing pandemics in the future as well as protecting human health and the environment. In addition, the potential of membrane technology in battling the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was also discussed briefly.

AB  - Selenium is an essential toxin that functions as essential micronutrient for maintaining good health with a small safety margin, but is toxic at slightly higher concentrations or doses. It is being distributed throughout the environment, including mines, water, plants, soils, wastewater and the atmosphere. A multi-sectorial studies should be required to eliminate the toxic effects of Se and retain its public health benefits through the application of various treatment strategies from the contaminated environment. Amongst them, the biological techniques by inoculating several Se-respiring microorganisms in removing Se-laden wastewater have received worldwide attention. The treatment performance of the reviewed biological technologies (bioreactors systems) have been performed higher removal efficiency, but their sustainability in continuous processes depends on the effects of operational parameters. Both in small- and large-scale operations, the phytoremediation techniques utilizing microalgae and artificial wetlands performed a considerable Se elimination efficiency. This paper provides a critical review on the occurrence of selenium, public health significance of selenium to be used as an essential micronutrient and supplement for patients with various diseases (including those with HIV-AIDS and COVID-19), its toxicity, and the biological selenium treatment technologies investigated at laboratory and currently in use at pilot, and full-scale processes.

AB  - Summary
This Review describes current knowledge on the epidemiology and causes of child and adolescent obesity, considerations for assessment, and current management approaches. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, obesity prevalence in children and adolescents had plateaued in many high-income countries despite levels of severe obesity having increased. However, in low-income and middle-income countries, obesity prevalence had risen. During the pandemic, weight gain among children and adolescents has increased in several jurisdictions. Obesity is associated with cardiometabolic and psychosocial comorbidity as well as premature adult mortality. The development and perpetuation of obesity is largely explained by a bio-socioecological framework, whereby biological predisposition, socioeconomic, and environmental factors interact together to promote deposition and proliferation of adipose tissue. First-line treatment approaches include family-based behavioural obesity interventions addressing diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviours, and sleep quality, underpinned by behaviour change strategies. Evidence for intensive dietary approaches, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic and bariatric surgery as supplemental therapies are emerging; however, access to these therapies is scarce in most jurisdictions. Research is still needed to inform the personalisation of treatment approaches of obesity in children and adolescents and their translation to clinical practice.

AB  - The Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine was developed over a century ago and has become one of the most used vaccines without undergoing a modern vaccine development life cycle. Despite this, the vaccine has protected many millions from severe and disseminated forms of tuberculosis (TB). In addition, BCG has cross-mycobacterial effects against non-tuberculous mycobacteria and off-target (also called non-specific or heterologous) effects against other infections and diseases. More recently, BCG’s effects on innate immunity suggest it might improve the immune response against viral respiratory infections including SARS-CoV-2. New TB vaccines, developed over the last 30 years, show promise, particularly in prevention of progression to disease from TB infection in young adults. The role of BCG in the context of new TB vaccines remains uncertain as most participants included in trials have been previously BCG immunised. BCG replacement vaccines are in efficacy trials and these may also have off-target effects.

AB  - In response to the novel coronavirus referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) – a virus that causes COVID-19 disease has led to wide use of sanitizers and disinfectants. This, in turn, triggered concerns on their potential deleterious effects to human health and the environment due to numerous chemicals incorporated in both product categories. Here, the current state of science regarding the occurrence and ecological effects of different classes of chemicals in these products (e.g., ultraviolent filters, fragrances, etc.) are summarized in different natural (e.g., rivers) and engineered (e.g., wastewater treatment plants) systems. Data collected in the literature suggests chemicals incorporated in sanitizers and disinfectants are present in the environment, and a large portion are toxic to fish, algae, and daphnia. Using the risk quotient approach based on occurrence data, we found eight chemicals that posed the highest risk to aquatic organisms in freshwater systems were benzalkonium chloride, 4-chloro-m-cresol, sodium ortho phenyl phenate, hydrogen peroxide, 1, 2-propanediol, 4-Methyl-benzilidine-camphor, ethylhexyl methoxy cinnamate, and octocrylene. Considering limited occurrence and effects information for most chemicals, further studies on environmental monitoring and potential consequences of long-term exposure in aquatic ecosystems are recommended.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Frailty is a multi-system clinical syndrome characterized by reduced physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to stressors. There is now established evidence recognizing its incremental value as a predictor of suboptimal outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) beyond conventional surgical risk scores and objective frailty assessment is integrated in major guidelines. Several frailty assessment tools have been developed and validated for use in patients undergoing TAVR with varying complexity, clinical pragmatism and outcomes assessed. In contemporary TAVR practice, frailty assessment guides patient selection, informs care requirements, and identifies those who may require supplemental treatment. Further opportunities to improve patient care in this area include identification of interventions that can mitigate the deleterious impact of frailty, evaluation of the role of frailty assessment in low surgical risk patients, and development of frailty management models that can be delivered virtually. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the concept of frailty, the available assessment tools, peri-procedural considerations in frail patients undergoing TAVR and future directions.

AB  - Apheresis is a modern medical approach in which plasma or cellular components are separated from the whole blood. Apheresis can be either diagnostic or therapeutic. Diagnostic apheresis is typically applied in hematology and cancer research. Therapeutic Apheresis (TA) includes a broad spectrum of extracorporeal treatments applied in various medical specialties, including Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Considering the complexity of the pathophysiologic characteristics of various clinical entities and in particular sepsis, apheresis methods are becoming increasingly applicable. Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) is the most common used method in ICU. It is considered as first line therapy for Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) and Guillain Barre Syndrome, while the current data for sepsis are scarce. Over the last decades, technologic evolution has led to increasing application of new and more selective methods based on adsorptive techniques. In this review we will describe the current data of characteristics of different techniques, safety and clinical impact of apheresis methods used in ICUs.

AB  - Summary
The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the importance of the rapid development of vaccines and antivirals. However, the potential for the emergence of antibiotic resistances due to the increased use of antibacterial cleaning products and therapeutics presents an additional, underreported threat. Most antibacterial cleaners contain simple quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs); however, these compounds are steadily becoming less effective as antibacterial agents. QACs are extensively used in SARS-CoV-2-related sanitization in clinical and household settings. Similarly, due to the danger of secondary infections, antibiotic therapeutics are increasingly used as a component of COVID-19 treatment regimens, even in the absence of a bacterial infection diagnosis. The increased use of antibacterial agents as cleaners and therapeutics is anticipated to lead to novel resistances in the coming years.

AB  - Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is one of the most widely used vaccines in the world. It protects against many non-mycobacterial infections secondary to its nonspecific immune effects. The mechanism for these effects includes modification of innate and adaptive immunity. The alteration in innate immunity is through histone modifications and epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes to develop an inflammatory phenotype, a process called “trained immunity.” The memory T cells of adaptive immunity are also responsible for resistance against secondary infections after administration of BCG vaccine, a process called “heterologous immunity.” Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine is known to not only boosts immune responses to many vaccines when they are co-administered but also decrease severity of these infections when used alone. The BCG vaccine by itself induces a TH1 type response, and its use as a vector has also shown promising results. This review article summarizes the studies showing effects of BCG vaccines on various viral infections, its role in enhancing vaccine responses, the mechanisms for this protective effect, and information on its effect on COVID-19.

AB  - The omega-3 fatty acids (n3-FAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) rapidly incorporate into cell membranes where they modulate signal transduction pathways, lipid raft formation, and cholesterol distribution. Membrane n3-FAs also form specialized pro-resolving mediators and other intracellular oxylipins that modulate inflammatory pathways, including T-cell differentiation and gene expression. Cardiovascular (CV) trials have shown that EPA, administered as icosapent ethyl (IPE), reduces composite CV events, along with plaque volume, in statin-treated, high-risk patients. Mixed EPA/DHA regimens have not shown these benefits, perhaps as the result of differences in formulation, dosage, or potential counter-regulatory actions of DHA. Indeed, EPA and DHA have distinct, tissue-specific effects on membrane structural organization and cell function. This review summarizes: (1) results of clinical outcome and imaging trials using n3-FA formulations; (2) membrane interactions of n3-FAs; (3) effects of n3-FAs on membrane oxidative stress and cholesterol crystalline domain formation during hyperglycemia; (4) n3-FA effects on endothelial function; (5) role of n3-FA-generated metabolites in inflammation; and (6) ongoing and future clinical investigations exploring treatment targets for n3-FAs, including COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
The vast majority of patients (>99%) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 survive immediate infection but remain at risk for persistent and/or delayed multisystem. This review of published reports through May 31, 2021, found that manifestations of postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection (PASC) affect between 33% and 98% of coronavirus disease 2019 survivors and comprise a wide range of symptoms and complications in the pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurologic, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, renal, endocrine, and musculoskeletal systems in both adult and pediatric populations. Additional complications are likely to emerge and be identified over time. Although data on PASC risk factors and vulnerable populations are scarce, evidence points to a disproportionate impact on racial/ethnic minorities, older patients, patients with preexisting conditions, and rural residents. Concerted efforts by researchers, health systems, public health agencies, payers, and governments are urgently needed to better understand and mitigate the long-term effects of PASC on individual and population health.

AB  - Several studies have shown how energy poverty (EP) increases morbidity and mortality, being a growing problem worldwide. We conducted a scoping review to synthesize the state of knowledge on the relationship between energy poverty (EP) and health, analysing the results according to different axes of inequality (gender, age, ethnicity/country of birth, social class, territory). We searched different bibliographic databases (MeSH and free-text terms); Eligibility criteria: 1] studies or interventions related to EP or its different expressions (inadequate temperatures; financial strain, inadequate housing conditions, composite indicators, heating and energy efficiency improvements); 2] health or health risk outcomes; 3] OECD countries; 4] English or Spanish language; 5] published before July 2020. We selected 38 studies out of 2768 (23 observational and 15 interventions). Almost all were quantitative (89.5%) and almost half were conducted in the UK (47.4%). The most studied EP expression was inadequate temperature. Eleven studies disaggregate the analyses by at least one axis of inequality and 21 target a vulnerable group. The studies linked EP to poorer general health, poorer mental health, poorer respiratory health, more and worse controlled chronic conditions, higher mortality, higher use of health services and higher exposure to health risks, with worse results for vulnerable groups across dimensions of inequality. Current scientific evidence should guide structural changes and immediate interventions to ameliorate EP. Future research must take into account the effects of inadequate warm temperatures and social inequalities, especially in the current context of climate and social crisis, the latter being exacerbated by the covid-19 pandemic.

AB  - Although chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignancy characterized by accumulation of tumor cells in the blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes and secondary lymphoid tissues, the hallmark of the disease and the major cause of death for patients with CLL is actually immune dysfunction and associated infections. Despite improvement in treatment based on combination chemoimmunotherapy and targeted treatment with BTK and BCL-2 inhibitors leading to longer overall survival for patients with CLL, the mortality due to infections have not improved over the last 4 decades. Thus, infections are now the main cause of death for patients with CLL, posing threats to the patient whether during the premalignant state of monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL), during the watch & wait phase for treatment naïve patients, or upon treatment in terms of chemoimmunotherapy or targeted treatment. To test whether the natural history of immune dysfunction and infections in CLL can be changed, we have developed the machine learning based algorithm CLL-TIM.org to identify these patients. The CLL-TIM algorithm is currently being used for selection of patients for the clinical trial PreVent-ACaLL (NCT03868722), testing whether short-term treatment with the BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib and the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax can improve immune function and decrease the risk of infections for this high-risk patient population. We here review the background for and management of infectious risks in CLL.

AB  - Sewer overflow (SO), which has attracted global attention, poses serious threat to public health and ecosystem. SO impacts public health via consumption of contaminated drinking water, aerosolization of pathogens, food-chain transmission, and direct contact with fecally-polluted rivers and beach sediments during recreation. However, no study has attempted to map the linkage between SO and public health including Covid-19 using scientometric analysis and systematic review of literature. Results showed that only few countries were actively involved in SO research in relation to public health. Furthermore, there are renewed calls to scale up environmental surveillance to safeguard public health. To safeguard public health, it is important for public health authorities to optimize water and wastewater treatment plants and improve building ventilation and plumbing systems to minimize pathogen transmission within buildings and transportation systems. In addition, health authorities should formulate appropriate policies that can enhance environmental surveillance and facilitate real-time monitoring of sewer overflow. Increased public awareness on strict personal hygiene and point-of-use-water-treatment such as boiling drinking water will go a long way to safeguard public health. Ecotoxicological studies and health risk assessment of exposure to pathogens via different transmission routes is also required to appropriately inform the use of lockdowns, minimize their socio-economic impact and guide evidence-based welfare/social policy interventions. Soft infrastructures, optimized sewer maintenance and prescreening of sewer overflow are recommended to reduce stormwater burden on wastewater treatment plant, curtail pathogen transmission and marine plastic pollution. Comprehensive, integrated surveillance and global collaborative efforts are important to curtail on-going Covid-19 pandemic and improve resilience against future pandemics.

AB  - Diesel and gasoline are the most used fossil fuels due to their high energy release and low cost for engines. However, the emission of air pollutants and greenhouse gases has caused severe environmental issues, and emission regulations are becoming stricter. Recently, several advances in emission control technologies for fossil fuel engines have been available, which need to be reviewed to manifest future research. Here, we reviewed the primary pollutants emitted from the diesel and gasoline-powered engines, their formation process, and the present technologies to control the emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this regard, this review concentrates on a particular matter (PM2.5 and PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), unburned hydrocarbons (UHC), and greenhouse gases (water vapor, CO2, N2O, etc.) as exhaust emissions, the difficulties they cause, and the strategies employed to reduce emissions. This review also provides a framework for understanding how to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gasses generated by diesel and gasoline-powered engines.

AB  - Compared with traditional de novo drug discovery, drug repurposing has become an attractive drug discovery strategy due to its low-cost and high efficiency. Through a comprehensive analysis of the candidates that have been identified with drug repositioning potentials, it is found that although some drugs do not show obvious advantages in the original indications, they may exert more obvious effects in other diseases. In addition, some drugs have a synergistic effect to exert better clinical efficacy if used in combination. Particularly, it has been confirmed that drug repositioning has benefits and values on the current public health emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which proved the great potential of drug repositioning. In this review, we systematically reviewed a series of representative drugs that have been repositioned for different diseases and illustrated successful cases in each disease. Especially, the mechanism of action for the representative drugs in new indications were explicitly explored for each disease, we hope this review can provide important insights for follow-up research.

KW  - Deep learning
KW  - Distributed computing
AB  - Medical data processing has grown into a prominent topic in the latest decades with the primary goal of maintaining patient data via new information technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor technologies, which generate patient indexes in hospital data networks. Innovations like distributed computing, Machine Learning (ML), blockchain, chatbots, wearables, and pattern recognition can adequately enable the collection and processing of medical data for decision-making in the healthcare era. Particularly, to assist experts in the disease diagnostic process, distributed computing is beneficial by digesting huge volumes of data swiftly and producing personalized smart suggestions. On the other side, the current globe is confronting an outbreak of COVID-19, so an early diagnosis technique is crucial to lowering the fatality rate. ML systems are beneficial in aiding radiologists in examining the incredible amount of medical images. Nevertheless, they demand a huge quantity of training data that must be unified for processing. Hence, developing Deep Learning (DL) confronts multiple issues, such as conventional data collection, quality assurance, knowledge exchange, privacy preservation, administrative laws, and ethical considerations. In this research, we intend to convey an inclusive analysis of the most recent studies in distributed computing platform applications based on five categorized platforms, including cloud computing, edge, fog, IoT, and hybrid platforms. So, we evaluated 27 articles regarding the usage of the proposed framework, deployed methods, and applications, noting the advantages, drawbacks, and the applied dataset and screening the security mechanism and the presence of the Transfer Learning (TL) method. As a result, it was proved that most recent research (about 43%) used the IoT platform as the environment for the proposed architecture, and most of the studies (about 46%) were done in 2021. In addition, the most popular utilized DL algorithm was the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with a percentage of 19.4%. Hence, despite how technology changes, delivering appropriate therapy for patients is the primary aim of healthcare-associated departments. Therefore, further studies are recommended to develop more functional architectures based on DL and distributed environments and better evaluate the present healthcare data analysis models.

Low muscle mass and malnutrition are prevalent conditions among adults of all ages, with any body weight or body mass index, and with acute or chronic conditions, including COVID-19. This article synthesizes the latest research advancements in muscle health and malnutrition, and their impact on immune function, and clinical outcomes. We provide a toolkit of illustrations and scientific information that healthcare professionals can use for knowledge translation, educating patients about the importance of identifying and treating low muscle mass and malnutrition. We focus on the emerging evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of aging and disease, as well as the cross-talk between skeletal muscle and the immune system. We address the importance of myosteatosis as a component of muscle composition, and discuss direct, indirect and surrogate assessments of muscle mass including ultrasound, computerized tomography, deuterated creatine dilution, and calf circumference. Assessments of muscle function are also included (handgrip strength, and physical performance tests). Finally, we address nutrition interventions to support anabolism, reduce catabolism, and improve patient outcomes. These include protein and amino acids, branched-chain amino acids, with a focus on leucine; β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB), vitamin D; n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), polyphenols, and oral nutritional supplements. We concluded with recommendations for clinical practice and a call for action on research focusing on evaluating the impact of body composition assessments on targeted nutrition interventions, and consequently their ability to improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as common life-threatening lung diseases with high mortality rates are mostly associated with acute and severe inflammation in lungs. With increasing in-depth studies of ALI/ARDS, significant breakthroughs have been made, however, there are still no effective pharmacological therapies for treatment of ALI/ARDS. Especially, the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is ravaging the globe, and causes severe respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, developing new drugs for therapy of ALI/ARDS is in great demand, which might also be helpful for treatment of COVID-19. Natural compounds have always inspired drug development, and numerous natural products have shown potential therapeutic effects on ALI/ARDS. Therefore, this review focuses on the potential therapeutic effects of natural compounds on ALI and the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) prevention is an urgent public health need with national and global implications. Stage A HF patients do not show HF symptoms or structural heart disease but are at risk of HF development. There are no unique recommendations on detecting Stage A patients. Patients in Stage A are heterogeneous; many patients have different combinations of risk factors and, therefore, have markedly different absolute risks for HF. Comprehensive strategies to prevent HF at Stage A include intensive blood pressure lowering, adequate glycemic and lipid management, and heart-healthy behaviors (adopting Life's Essential 8). First and foremost, it is imperative to improve public awareness of HF risk factors and implement healthy lifestyle choices very early. In addition, recognize the HF risk‐enhancing factors, which are nontraditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors that identify individuals at high risk for HF (genetic susceptibility for HF, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, chronic inflammatory disease, sleep-disordered breathing, adverse pregnancy outcomes, radiation therapy, a history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy exposure, and COVID-19). Early use of biomarkers, imaging markers, and echocardiography (noninvasive measures of subclinical systolic and diastolic dysfunction) may enhance risk prediction among individuals without established CV disease and prevent chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy. Efforts are needed to address social determinants of HF risk for primordial HF prevention.Central illustrationPolicies developed by organizations such as the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and the American Diabetes Association to reduce CV disease events must go beyond secondary prevention and encompass primordial and primary prevention.

AB  - Hypertension remains the most important modifiable risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. While it is clear that inflammation plays a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of hypertension, several novel discoveries have been made within the past decade that have advanced the field and have provided new mechanistic insights. First, recent studies have identified a central role of sodium-induced immune cell activation in the pathogenesis of hypertension by altering the gut microbiome and formation of products of lipid oxidation known as isolevuglandins. Second, cytokine elaboration by the inflammasome leading to end-organ dysfunction and immune activation has been found to play a role in the genesis of hypertension. Third, novel techniques have identified previously uncharacterized immune cell populations that may play a functional role in these processes. Finally, the role of inflammation in hypertension may be an important mediator of severe COVID-19 infections. In this review, we discuss these recent advances in the study of inflammation and hypertension and highlight topics for future studies.

AB  - Climate change is recognized as a major contributor to the increase in heat-related deaths, and the frequency of heatwave days is expected to continue rising in the future. Addressing the impacts of climate change is a critical component of the United Nations' sustainable development goals, emphasizing the need for urgent action. To aid decision-makers in this process, the heat vulnerability index (HVI) serves as a valuable tool for identifying areas most susceptible to heatwaves, informing adaptation plans, and assessing influential factors. In this comprehensive review article, we examined 104 relevant studies that focus on the HVI. Our analysis explores key indicators of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity that contribute to the vulnerability index, and which are associated with increased mortality. While certain indicators are location-specific, others—such as building characteristics—have broader applicability but require more focused consideration. Furthermore, we present various data analysis and visualization options, as well as potential weaknesses of the indicators. This information will aid researchers and practitioners in selecting appropriate indicators for their specific areas and developing robust heat vulnerability indexes. By understanding these factors, we can prioritize interventions and strategies to reduce heat-related excess mortality and improve overall human health outcomes.

AB  - The occurrence of a novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), created a serious challenge worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 has high infectivity, the ability to be transmitted even during the asymptomatic phase, and relatively low virulence, which has resulted in rapid transmission. SARS-CoV-2 can invade epithelial cells, hence, many patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have suffered from vascular diseases (VDs) in addition to pulmonary manifestations. Accordingly, SARS-CoV-2 may can worsen the clinical condition of the patients with pre-existing VDs. Endothelial cells express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is a biological enzyme that converts angiotensin (Ang)− 2 to Ang-(1−7). SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cell receptor for viral entry. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus promotes downregulation of ACE2, Ang-(1−7), and anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as, an increase in Ang-2, resulting in pro-inflammatory cytokines. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause hypertension, and endothelial damage, which can lead to intravascular thrombosis. In this review, we have concentrated on the effect of SARS-CoV-2 in peripheral vascular diseases (PVDs) and ACE2 as an enzyme in Renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). A comprehensive search was performed on PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, using related keywords. Articles focusing on (“SARS-CoV-2”, OR “COVID-19”), AND (“Vascular disease”, OR “Peripheral vascular disease”, OR interested disease name) with regard to MeSH terms, were selected. According to the studies, it is supposed that vascular diseases may increase susceptibility to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection due to increased thrombotic burden and endothelial dysfunction. Understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism and vascular system pathogenesis is crucial for effective management and treatment in pre-existing vascular diseases.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Like many areas of medicine, vascular surgery has been transformed by the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. Public health precautions to minimize disease transmission have led to reduced attendance at hospitals and clinics in elective and emergency settings; fewer face-to-face and hands-on clinical interactions; and increased reliance on telemedicine, virtual attendance, investigations, and digital therapeutics. However, a “silver lining” to the COVID-19 pandemic may be the mainstream acceptance and acceleration of telemedicine, remote monitoring, digital health technology, and three-dimensional technologies, such as three-dimensional printing and virtual reality, by connecting health care providers to patients in a safe, reliable, and timely manner, and supplanting face-to-face surgical simulation and training. This review explores the impact of these changes in the delivery of vascular surgical care.

AB  - Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) is being extensively investigated as a treatment, with mixed results to date. Overall, there has been a generalized lack of appropriateness in prescriptions, which, in the field of transfusion medicine, is termed patient-blood management.
Objectives
We aimed to separate study design variables that could affect clinical outcome after CCP therapy. We focus here on variables such as pretransfusion antibody testing in recipients, dose adjustments and antibody affinity measurements.
Sources
We searched PubMed and preprint servers for relevant preclinical and clinical studies discussing each of these variables in the field of CCP therapy.
Content
We show evidence that neglecting those variables has affected the outcomes of the vast majority of CCP clinical trials to date.
Implications
A better understanding of such variables will improve the design of the next generation of CCP clinical trials. This will likely lead to better clinical outcomes and will minimize risks of immune evasion from subneutralizing doses of neutralizing antibodies.

AB  - In this paper, a model is proposed of the pathophysiological processes of COVID-19 starting from the infection of human type II alveolar epithelial cells (pneumocytes) by SARS-CoV-2 and culminating in the development of ARDS. The innate immune response to infection of type II alveolar epithelial cells leads both to their death by apoptosis and pyroptosis and to alveolar macrophage activation. Activated macrophages secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and tend to polarise into the inflammatory M1 phenotype. These changes are associated with activation of vascular endothelial cells and thence the recruitment of highly toxic neutrophils and inflammatory activated platelets into the alveolar space. Activated vascular endothelial cells become a source of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and contribute to the development of coagulopathy, systemic sepsis, a cytokine storm and ARDS. Pulmonary activated platelets are also an important source of proinflammatory cytokines and ROS, as well as exacerbating pulmonary neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses and contributing to systemic sepsis by binding to neutrophils to form platelet-neutrophil complexes (PNCs). PNC formation increases neutrophil recruitment, activation priming and extraversion of these immune cells into inflamed pulmonary tissue, thereby contributing to ARDS. Sequestered PNCs cause the development of a procoagulant and proinflammatory environment. The contribution to ARDS of increased extracellular histone levels, circulating mitochondrial DNA, the chromatin protein HMGB1, decreased neutrophil apoptosis, impaired macrophage efferocytosis, the cytokine storm, the toll-like receptor radical cycle, pyroptosis, necroinflammation, lymphopenia and a high Th17 to regulatory T lymphocyte ratio are detailed.

AB  - For centuries, traditional medicines of Ayurveda have been in use to manage infectious and non-infectious diseases. The key embodiment of traditional medicines is the holistic system of approach in the management of human diseases. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection is an ongoing pandemic, which has emerged as the major health threat worldwide and is causing significant stress, morbidity and mortality. Studies from the individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection have shown significant immune dysregulation and cytokine overproduction. Neutrophilia and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio has been correlated to poor outcome due to the disease. Neutrophils, component of innate immune system, upon stimulation expel DNA along with histones and granular proteins to form extracellular traps (NETs). Although, these DNA lattices possess beneficial activity in trapping and eliminating pathogens, NETs may also cause adverse effects by inducing immunothrombosis and tissue damage in diseases including Type 2 Diabetes and atherosclerosis. Tissues of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects showed microthrombi with neutrophil-platelet infiltration and serum showed elevated NETs components, suggesting large involvement and uncontrolled activation of neutrophils leading to pathogenesis and associated organ damage. Hence, traditional Ayurvedic herbs exhibiting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may act in a manner that might prove beneficial in targeting over-functioning of neutrophils and there by promoting normal immune homeostasis. In the present manuscript, we have reviewed and discussed pathological importance of NETs formation in SARS-CoV-2 infections and discuss how various Ayurvedic herbs can be explored to modulate neutrophil function and inhibit NETs formation in the context of a) anti-microbial activity to enhance neutrophil function, b) immunomodulatory effects to maintain neutrophil mediated immune homeostasis and c) to inhibit NETs mediated thrombosis.

AB  - Summary
The health and care sector plays a valuable role in improving population health and societal wellbeing, protecting people from the financial consequences of illness, reducing health and income inequalities, and supporting economic growth. However, there is much debate regarding the appropriate level of funding for health and care in the UK. In this Health Policy paper, we look at the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and historical spending in the UK and comparable countries, assess the role of private spending, and review spending projections to estimate future needs. Public spending on health has increased by 3·7% a year on average since the National Health Service (NHS) was founded in 1948 and, since then, has continued to assume a larger share of both the economy and government expenditure. In the decade before the ongoing pandemic started, the rate of growth of government spending for the health and care sector slowed. We argue that without average growth in public spending on health of at least 4% per year in real terms, there is a real risk of degradation of the NHS, reductions in coverage of benefits, increased inequalities, and increased reliance on private financing. A similar, if not higher, level of growth in public spending on social care is needed to provide high standards of care and decent terms and conditions for social care staff, alongside an immediate uplift in public spending to implement long-overdue reforms recommended by the Dilnot Commission to improve financial protection. COVID-19 has highlighted major issues in the capacity and resilience of the health and care system. We recommend an independent review to examine the precise amount of additional funds that are required to better equip the UK to withstand further acute shocks and major threats to health.

AB  - Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) emerged as a powerful, actionable health management tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hypothesizing future uses, we explored its potential for real-time, tracking of progress in attaining United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) globally as a non-expensive method using existing infrastructure. We inventoried (i) literature-documented sewerage infrastructure, (ii) demographics of populations served, and (iii) WBE markers informative of 9 SDGs. Among the 17 different sustainable development goals listed by the UN 2030 agenda, more than half of these may be monitored by using WBE monitoring at centralized treatment infrastructure as tabulated in this study. Driven mainly by COVID-19, WBE currently is practiced in at least 55 countries, reaching about 300 million people. Expansion of WBE to 109,000 + treatment plants inventoried in 129 countries would increase global coverage 9-fold to 34.7% or 2.7 billion, leaving out 5 billion people not served by centralized sewerage systems. Associations between population demographics and present-day infrastructure are explored, and geospatial regions particularly vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks are identified. The results suggest that difference in the differential outcomes in well-being is an outcome of the sanitation infrastructure inequalities and lack of sanitation infrastructure creates doubly disadvantaged populations at risk of poor hygiene and cut off from the early-warning benefits of conventional WBE. This is the first study to explore the feasibility and potential barriers to the use of WBE for tracking the attainment of SDGs globally with at least 9 out of 17 SDGs.

AB  - Reducing the incidence and prevalence of standard modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (SMuRFs) is critical to tackling the global burden of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, a substantial number of individuals develop coronary atherosclerosis despite no SMuRFs. SMuRFless patients presenting with myocardial infarction have been observed to have an unexpected higher early mortality compared to their counterparts with at least 1 SMuRF. Evidence for optimal management of these patients is lacking. We assembled an international, multidisciplinary team to develop an evidence-based clinical pathway for SMuRFless CAD patients. A modified Delphi method was applied. The resulting pathway confirms underlying atherosclerosis and true SMuRFless status, ensures evidence-based secondary prevention, and considers additional tests and interventions for less typical contributors. This dedicated pathway for a previously overlooked CAD population, with an accompanying registry, aims to improve outcomes through enhanced adherence to evidence-based secondary prevention and additional diagnosis of modifiable risk factors observed.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), and is genetically related to the 2003 SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) coronaviruses. Recent studies have reported that similar to SARS-CoV, this strain expresses a spike protein (S) with a receptor binding domain (RBD) that binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) – an enzyme expressed mostly in the endothelium, kidneys, heart, gastrointestinal tract and lungs – to facilitate viral entry and intracellular replication. Incidentally, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is integral to physiologic control of both ACE and ACE2 expression, and is an essential system utilized by SARS-CoV-2, albeit with varying schools of thought on how it can affect viral entry. In this paper, we will review current knowledge on the RAAS and how it can be affected by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroid use at the organ and cellular levels. We will then discuss the relevance of these interactions on organ-specific ACE2 expression, and provide scientific insights on how this mechanism can potentially affect SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early phases of disease. From the standpoint of other known viruses, we will then aim to discuss the potential uses or restrictions of these drugs in viral infection, and provide an update on relevant studies about COVID-19.

AB  - Ambient air pollution, and especially particulate matter (PM) air pollution <2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5), has clearly emerged as an important yet often overlooked risk factor for atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease (IHD). In this review, we examine the available evidence demonstrating how acute and chronic PM2.5 exposure clinically translates into a heightened coronary atherosclerotic burden and an increased risk of acute ischemic coronary events. Moreover, we provide insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying PM2.5-mediated atherosclerosis, focusing on the specific biological mechanism through which PM2.5 exerts its detrimental effects. Further, we discuss about the possible mechanisms that explain the recent findings reporting a strong association between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, increased PM2.5 exposure, and morbidity and mortality from IHD. We also address the possible mitigation strategies that should be implemented to reduce the impact of PM2.5 on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and underscoring the strong need of clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of specific interventions (including both PM2.5 reduction and/or specific drugs) in reducing the incidence of IHD. Finally, we introduce the emerging concept of the exposome, highlighting the close relationship between PM2.5 and other environmental exposures (i.e.: traffic noise and climate change) in terms of common underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and possible mitigation strategies.

AB  - Background
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was isolated as a ‘hypertensinconverting enzyme’. There have been considerable advances in understanding the metabolic role of ACE in the body. This review attempts to highlight the role of ACE enzyme in the physiological and pathological processes occurring in the organs in which it is localized.
Methods
The literature was searched from the websites of the National Library of Medicine (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and Pub Med Central, the U.S. National Library of Medicine's digital archive of life sciences journal literature.
Results
The involvement of ACE in regulation of blood pressure forms its central action but it has a role to play in a variety of physiological processes occurring in the organs in which it is localized like the lungs, macrophages, brain, pancreas, liver etc. It has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases including COVID-19.
Conclusions
More studies need to be carried out in order to validate the use of ACE levels in the diagnosis and monitoring of the diseases associated, and facilitate the use of ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers in the management of the same, so this wonder molecule can be utilized to its full potential.

AB  - Ligusticum chuanxiong, the dried rhizome of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort, has been widely applied in traditional Chinese medicine for treating plague, and it has appeared frequently in the prescriptions against COVID-19 lately. Ligusticum chuanxiong polysaccharide (LCPs) is one of the effective substances, which has various activities, such as, anti-oxidation, promoting immunity, anti-tumor, and anti-bacteria. The purified fractions of LCPs are considered to be pectic polysaccharides, which are mainly composed of GalA, Gal, Ara and Rha, and are generally linked by α-1,4-d-GalpA, α-1,2-l-Rhap, α-1,5-l-Araf, β-1,3-d-Galp and β-1,4-d-Galp, etc. The pectic polysaccharide shows an anti-infective inflammatory activity, which is related to antiviral infection of Ligusticum chuanxiong. In this article, the isolation, purification, structural features, and biological activities of LCPs in recent years are reviewed, and the potential of LCPs against viral infection as well as questions that need future research are discussed.

AB  - Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic created a unique opportunity to study the effects of infection and vaccination on disease. The year 2020 was dominated by infection and its consequences. The year 2021 was dominated by vaccination and its consequences. It will still take several years for full maturation of databases required for robust epidemiological studies. Therefore, this review on the implications for neuro-ophthalmology draws on resources presently available including reported adverse reactions to vaccination. Illustrative clinical cases are presented. The spectrum of pathology following infection with SARS-CoV-2 falls into 4 main categories: autoimmune, vascular, sequelae of brain damage, and miscellaneous. This review is exhaustive, but the most common conditions discussed relate to headaches and associated symptoms; vertigo, diplopia, and nystagmus; vascular complications of the eye and brain; cranial nerve (mono-)neuropathies; photophobia, ocular discomfort, and optic neuritis. Of the 36 main adverse reactions reviewed, vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia is a novel complication requiring specific hematological management. Updated diagnostic criteria are summarized. It is relevant to remember taking a medication history because of side effects and to recognize the relevance of comorbidities. The clinical assessment can frequently be performed virtually. Consensus recommendations on telemedicine and the virtual assessment are summarized in a practical and compressed format. The review concludes with an epidemiological tetralogy to interrogate, in future studies, associations with (1) SARS-CoV-2 pandemic infection, (2) SARS-CoV-2 worldwide vaccination, and (3) the possibility of a rebound effect of infections in the pandemic aftermath.

AB  - Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the human central nervous system, and they play an important role in the regulation of neuronal physiology. In neurological disorders, astrocyte disintegration leads to the release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) from tissue into the bloodstream. Elevated serum levels of GFAP can serve as blood biomarkers, and a useful prognostic tool to facilitate the early diagnosis of several neurological diseases ranging from stroke to neurodegenerative disorders. This systematic review synthesizes studies published between January 2012 and September 2021 that used GFAP as a potential blood biomarker to detect neurological disorders. The following electronic databases were accessed: MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science. In all the databases, the following search strategy was used: ¨GFAP¨ OR ¨glial fibrillary acidic protein¨ AND ¨neurological¨ OR ¨neurodegenerative¨ AND ¨plasma¨ OR ¨serum¨. The initial search identified 1152 articles. After the exclusion criteria were applied, 48 publications that reported GFAP levels in neurological disorders were identified. A total of16 different neurological disorders that have plasmatic GFAP levels as a possible biomarker for the disease were described in the articles, being: multiple sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson disease, COVID-19, epileptic seizures, Wilson Disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, major depressive disorder, glioblastoma, spinal cord injury, asthma, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and Friedreich’s ataxia. Our review shows an association between GFAP levels and the disease being studied, suggesting that elevated GFAP levels are a potentially valuable diagnostic biomarker in the evaluation of different neurological diseases.

AB  - Summary
Therapy with genetically engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting the CD19 antigen is promising for a number of refractory or relapsed B-cell malignancies. Information on the infectious complications of this immunotherapeutic strategy is scarce and difficult to interpret, as many factors influence infection incidence and outcomes. CAR T-cell therapy is usually given to patients with haematological cancers who have been heavily pretreated and are severely immunosuppressed. Moreover, the risk of infection is increased by the administration of lymphodepleting chemotherapy before CAR T-cell infusion, and by the development of complications such as cytokine release syndrome or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, which are managed with anti-interleukin-6 antibodies, or corticosteroids, or both. On-target, off-tumour toxicities, such as B-cell aplasia, hypogammaglobulinaemia, and persistent or biphasic cytopenia, are common. In this Review, we evaluate the reported infectious complications of CAR T-cell therapy and associated risk factors and offer perspectives on its infection risk.

AB  - Summary
Globally, there are an estimated 13.3 million cases of acute kidney injury (AKI) annually. Although infections are a common cause of AKI globally, most infection-associated AKI occurs in low- and lower-middle-income countries. There are marked differences in the etiology of infection-associated AKI across age groups, populations at risk, and geographic location. This article provides a global overview of different infections that are associated commonly with AKI, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human immunodeficiency virus, malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, tick-borne illnesses, and viral hemorrhagic fevers. Further discussion focuses on infectious conditions associated with AKI including sepsis, diarrheal diseases and pregnancy, peripartum and neonatal AKI. This article also discusses the future of infection-associated AKI in the framework of climate change. It explores how increased investment in achieving the sustainable development goals may contribute to the International Society of Nephrology's 0 by 25 objective to curtail avoidable AKI-related fatalities by 2025.

AB  - Hospitalisation with an acute medical illness represents a significant risk factor for venous thromboembolism. Identification of patients at high risk of VTE at hospital admission and provision of appropriate thromboprophylaxis is a key intervention to improve patient safety during hospitalisation. The successful implementation of a systematic approach to VTE prevention in England highlights the effectiveness of this approach. However, the optimal strategy for identification of at-risk patients enabling targeted thromboprophylaxis provisions remains uncertain and many VTE events occur despite provision of appropriate thromboprophylaxis. In this narrative review, we discuss the pros and cons of commonly utilised VTE risk assessment tools for acutely ill medical patients, the current controversies in optimal dosing and duration of thromboprophylaxis and highlight special patient populations where further research is required.

Summary of findings
Disease pandemics caused by emerging pathogens impacted the social development, health and wealth of most societies in human history. In an outbreak, the first months determine its course. To block an exponential spread and the development of an epi/ pandemic early, vaccine availability in sufficient quantities is of paramount importance. It is inevitable that new human viruses will emerge. Any future pandemic will come likely from RNA viruses through zoonotic or vector transmission, but we cannot predict when or where “Disease X” will strike. Public health, scientific and societal readiness plans need to include: continuous identification of new viruses in common mammalian reservoir hosts; continuous epidemiological surveillance, including wastewater sampling; establishment of prototype vaccine libraries against various virus families sharing functional and structural properties; testing of various and innovative vaccine platforms including mRNA, vector, nasal or oral vaccines for suitability by virus family; functional clinical trial sites and laboratory networks in various geographies; more efficient phasing of preclinical and clinical activities; global harmonization and streamlining of regulatory requirements including pre-established protocols; and societal preparedness including combating any pandemic of misinformation.
Conclusions
“Outbreaks are unavoidable, pandemics are optional”.

AB  - Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a pandemic in March 2020, and more than 117 million people worldwide have been confirmed to have been infected. Scientists, medical professionals, and other stakeholders are racing against time to find and develop effective medicines for COVID-19. However, no drug with high efficacy to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection has been approved. With the increasing popularity of gene therapy, scientists have explored the utilization of small RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) as therapeutics. miRNAs are non-coding RNAs with high affinity for the 3′-UTRs of targeted messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Interactions between host cells and viral genomes may induce the upregulation or downregulation of various miRNAs. Therefore, understanding the expression patterns of these miRNAs and their functions will provide insights into potential miRNA-based therapies. This review systematically summarizes the potential targets of miRNA-based therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection and examines the viability of possible transfection methods.

AB  - Takotsubo syndrome is a syndrome of acute heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction that is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It occurs in both sexes and at all ages, but predominates in post-menopausal women for reasons that are unclear. In a patient who presents with cardiac symptoms, electrocardiographic changes, and/or biomarker elevation indicating myocardial stress (i.e. troponin elevation), this condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Cardiac imaging is critical for a timely diagnosis of this condition and has management implications. This syndrome can occur with or without underlying coronary artery disease, and while there are various characteristic myocardial patterns described on imaging, the most common one is left ventricular dysfunction due to apical stunning with basal hyperkinesis. In the acute phase, Takotsubo syndrome can lead to life-threatening sequelae, including cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, thromboembolism, and arrhythmias. Multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms are implicated, including an acute increase in left ventricular afterload in the setting of sympathetic activation with a catecholamine storm, multi-vessel coronary vasospasm, coronary endothelial microvascular dysfunction, and inflammation. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge surrounding presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of this under-diagnosed condition.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a light on the complex relationship between science and policy. Policymakers have had to make decisions at speed in conditions of uncertainty, implementing policies that have had profound consequences for people's lives. Yet this process has sometimes been characterised by fragmentation, opacity and a disconnect between evidence and policy. In the United Kingdom, concerns about the secrecy that initially surrounded this process led to the creation of Independent SAGE, an unofficial group of scientists from different disciplines that came together to ask policy-relevant questions, review the evolving evidence, and make evidence-based recommendations. The group took a public health approach with a population perspective, worked in a holistic transdisciplinary way, and were committed to public engagement. In this paper, we review the lessons learned during its first year. These include the importance of learning from local expertise, the value of learning from other countries, the role of civil society as a critical friend to government, finding appropriate relationships between science and policy, and recognising the necessity of viewing issues through an equity lens.

AB  - Summary
Shigellosis causes considerable public health burden, leading to excess deaths as well as acute and chronic consequences, particularly among children living in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Several Shigella vaccine candidates are advancing in clinical trials and offer promise. Although multiple target populations might benefit from a Shigella vaccine, the primary strategic goal of WHO is to accelerate the development and accessibility of safe, effective, and affordable Shigella vaccines that reduce mortality and morbidity in children younger than 5 years living in LMICs. WHO consulted with regulators and policy makers at national, regional, and global levels to evaluate pathways that could accelerate regulatory approval in this priority population. Special consideration was given to surrogate efficacy biomarkers, the role of controlled human infection models, and the establishment of correlates of protection. A field efficacy study in children younger than 5 years in LMICs is needed to ensure introduction in this priority population.

AB  - Since the beginning of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) virus pandemic, several highly effective and safe vaccines have been produced at remarkable speed. Following global implementation of vaccination programmes, cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following administration of adenoviral vector-based vaccines started being reported. In this review we discuss the known pathogenesis and epidemiology of so-called vaccine induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT). We consider the available guidelines, diagnostic laboratory tests and management options for these patients. Finally, we discuss important unanswered questions and areas for future research in this novel pathoclinical entity.

AB  - Nanoparticles have been widely studied in the fields of biotechnology, pharmacy, optics and medicine and have broad application prospects. Numerous studies have shown significant interest in utilizing nanoparticles for chemically coating or coupling drugs, aiming to address the challenges of drug delivery, including degradability and uncertainty. Furthermore, the utilization of lipid nanoparticles loaded with novel coronavirus antigen mRNA to control the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a notable surge in research on nanoparticle vaccines. Hence, nanoparticles have emerged as a crucial delivery system for disease prevention and treatment, bearing immense significance. Current research highlights that nanoparticles offer superior efficacy and potential compared to conventional drug treatment and prevention methods. Notably, for drug delivery applications, it is imperative to utilize biodegradable nanoparticles. This paper reviews the structures and characteristics of various biodegradable nanoparticles and their applications in biomedicine in order to inspire more researchers to further explore the functions of nanoparticles. RNA plays a pivotal role in regulating the occurrence and progression of diseases, but its inherent susceptibility to degradation poses a challenge. In light of this, we conducted a comprehensive review of the research advancements concerning RNA-containing biodegradable nanoparticles in the realm of disease prevention and treatment, focusing on cancer, inflammatory diseases, and viral infections.

AB  - Summary
In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), urgent action is needed to curb a growing crisis in cancer incidence and mortality. Without rapid interventions, data estimates show a major increase in cancer mortality from 520 348 in 2020 to about 1 million deaths per year by 2030. Here, we detail the state of cancer in SSA, recommend key actions on the basis of analysis, and highlight case studies and successful models that can be emulated, adapted, or improved across the region to reduce the growing cancer crises. Recommended actions begin with the need to develop or update national cancer control plans in each country. Plans must include childhood cancer plans, managing comorbidities such as HIV and malnutrition, a reliable and predictable supply of medication, and the provision of psychosocial, supportive, and palliative care. Plans should also engage traditional, complementary, and alternative medical practices employed by more than 80% of SSA populations and pathways to reduce missed diagnoses and late referrals. More substantial investment is needed in developing cancer registries and cancer diagnostics for core cancer tests. We show that investments in, and increased adoption of, some approaches used during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as hypofractionated radiotherapy and telehealth, can substantially increase access to cancer care in Africa, accelerate cancer prevention and control efforts, increase survival, and save billions of US dollars over the next decade. The involvement of African First Ladies in cancer prevention efforts represents one practical approach that should be amplified across SSA. Moreover, investments in workforce training are crucial to prevent millions of avoidable deaths by 2030. We present a framework that can be used to strategically plan cancer research enhancement in SSA, with investments in research that can produce a return on investment and help drive policy and effective collaborations. Expansion of universal health coverage to incorporate cancer into essential benefits packages is also vital. Implementation of the recommended actions in this Commission will be crucial for reducing the growing cancer crises in SSA and achieving political commitments to the UN Sustainable Development Goals to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by a third by 2030.

AB  - Health problems of women experiencing homelessness are driven either from the usual background characteristics of this population, or from the homeless lifestyle. Apart from poverty and unemployment, transition to homelessness is often associated with substance abuse, history of victimization, stress, poor mental health and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Water insecurity can undermine bodily hygiene and dental health, posing a greater risk of dehydration and opportunistic infections. Exposure to extreme environmental conditions like heat waves and natural disasters increases morbidity, accelerates aging, and reduces life expectancy. Nutrition-wise, a high prevalence of food insecurity, obesity, and micronutrient deficiencies are apparent due to low diet quality and food waste. Poor hygiene, violence, and overcrowding increase the susceptibility of these women to communicable diseases, including sexually transmitted ones and COVID-19. Furthermore, established cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus are often either undertreated or neglected, and their complications are more widespread than in the general population. In addition, lack of medical screening and contraception non-use induce a variety of reproductive health issues. All these health conditions are tightly related to violations of human rights in this population, including the rights to housing, water, food, reproduction, health, work, and no discrimination. Thus, the care provided to women experiencing homelessness should be optimized at a multidimensional level, spanning beyond the provision of a warm bed, to include access to clean water and sanitation, psychological support and stress-coping strategies, disease management and acute health care, food of adequate quality, opportunities for employment and support for any minor dependants.

AB  - The emergence of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS-CoV-2) variants that cause coronavirus disease is of global concern. Severe acute respiratory disease variants of concern (VOC) exhibiting greater transmissibility, and potentially increased risk of hospitalization, severity and mortality, are attributed to molecular mutations in outer viral surface spike proteins. Thus, there is a reliance on using appropriate counter-disease measures, including non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination. The best evidence suggests that the use of frontline biocides effectively inactivate coronavirus similarly, including VOC, such as 202012/01, 501Y.V2 and P.1 that have rapidly replaced the wild-type variant in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, respectively. However, this review highlights that efficacy of VOC-disinfection will depend on the type of biocide and the parameters governing the activity. VOC are likely to be similar in size to the wild-type strain, thus implying that existing guidelines for use and re-use of face masks post disinfection remain relevant. Monitoring to avoid injudicious use of biocides during the coronavirus disease era is required as prolonged and excessive biocide usage may negatively impact our receiving environments; thus, highlighting the potential for alternative more environmental-friendly sustainable biocide solutions. Traditional biocides may promote cross-antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics in problematical bacteria. The existing filtration efficacy of face masks is likely to perform similarly for VOC due to similar viral size; however, advances in face mask manufacturing by way incorporating new anti-viral materials will potentially enhance their design and functionality for existing and potential future pandemics.

AB  - Summary
The objective of this Personal View is to compare transmissibility, hospitalisation, and mortality rates for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with those of other epidemic coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and pandemic influenza viruses. The basic reproductive rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 2·5 (range 1·8–3·6) compared with 2·0–3·0 for SARS-CoV and the 1918 influenza pandemic, 0·9 for MERS-CoV, and 1·5 for the 2009 influenza pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 causes mild or asymptomatic disease in most cases; however, severe to critical illness occurs in a small proportion of infected individuals, with the highest rate seen in people older than 70 years. The measured case fatality rate varies between countries, probably because of differences in testing strategies. Population-based mortality estimates vary widely across Europe, ranging from zero to high. Numbers from the first affected region in Italy, Lombardy, show an all age mortality rate of 154 per 100 000 population. Differences are most likely due to varying demographic structures, among other factors. However, this new virus has a focal dissemination; therefore, some areas have a higher disease burden and are affected more than others for reasons that are still not understood. Nevertheless, early introduction of strict physical distancing and hygiene measures have proven effective in sharply reducing R0 and associated mortality and could in part explain the geographical differences.

AB  - In this article the technique, interpretation, and diagnostic performance of scintigraphy for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) are reviewed. Lung scintigraphy has stood the test of time as a reliable and validated examination for the determination of PE. Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) lung scintigraphy assesses the functional consequences of the clot on its downstream vascular bed in conjunction with the underlying ventilatory status of the affected lung region, in contrast to CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), which visualizes presence of the clot within affected vessels. Most-commonly used ventilation radiopharmaceuticals are Technetium-99m labeled aerosols (such as 99mTechnetium-DTPA), or ultrafine particle suspensions (99mTc-Technegas) which reach the distal lung in proportion to regional distribution of ventilation. Perfusion images are obtained after intravenous administration 99mTc-labeled macro-aggregated albumin particles which lodge in the distal pulmonary capillaries. Both planar and tomographic methods of imaging, each favored in different geographical regions, will be described. Guidelines for interpretation of scintigraphy have been issues by both the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, and by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine. Breast tissue is particularly radiosensitive during pregnancy due to its highly proliferative state and many guidelines recommend use of lung scintigraphy rather than CTPA in this population. Several maneuvers are available in order to further reduce radiation exposure including reducing radiopharmaceutical dosages or omitting ventilation altogether, functionally converting the study to a low-dose screening examination; if perfusion defects are present, further testing is necessary. Several groups have also performed perfusion-only studies during the COVID epidemic in order to reduce risk of respiratory contagion. In patients where perfusion defects are present, further testing is again necessary to avoid false-positive results. Improved availability of personal protective equipment, and reduced risk of serious infection, have rendered this maneuver moot in most practices. First introduced 60 years ago, subsequent advances in radiopharmaceutical development and imaging methods have positioned lung scintigraphy to continue to play an important clinical and research role in the diagnosis of acute PE.

AB  - Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed faults in the way we assess preparedness and response capacities for public health emergencies. Existing frameworks are limited in scope, and do not sufficiently consider complex social, economic, political, regulatory, and ecological factors. One Health, through its focus on the links among humans, animals, and ecosystems, is a valuable approach through which existing assessment frameworks can be analysed and new ways forward proposed. Although in the past few years advances have been made in assessment tools such as the International Health Regulations Joint External Evaluation, a rapid and radical increase in ambition is required. To sufficiently account for the range of complex systems in which health emergencies occur, assessments should consider how problems are defined across stakeholders and the wider sociopolitical environments in which structures and institutions operate. Current frameworks do little to consider anthropogenic factors in disease emergence or address the full array of health security hazards across the social–ecological system. A complex and interdependent set of challenges threaten human, animal, and ecosystem health, and we cannot afford to overlook important contextual factors, or the determinants of these shared threats. Health security assessment frameworks should therefore ensure that the process undertaken to prioritise and build capacity adheres to core One Health principles and that interventions and outcomes are assessed in terms of added value, trade-offs, and cobenefits across human, animal, and environmental health systems.

AB  - Summary
Circulating concentrations of the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) are known to be increased in pro-inflammatory critical care syndromes, such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Elevations in serum IL-6 concentrations in patients with severe COVID-19 have led to renewed interest in the cytokine as a therapeutic target. However, although the pro-inflammatory properties of IL-6 are widely known, the cytokine also has a series of important physiological and anti-inflammatory functions. An adequate understanding of the complex processes by which IL-6 signalling occurs is crucial for the correct interpretation of IL-6 concentrations in the blood or lung, the use of IL-6 as a critical care biomarker, or the design of effective anti-IL-6 strategies. Here, we outline the role of IL-6 in health and disease, explain the different types of IL-6 signalling and their contribution to the net biological effect of the cytokine, describe the approaches to IL-6 inhibition that are currently available, and discuss implications for the future use of treatments such as tocilizumab in the critical care setting.

A large number of patients admitted to ICU end with a deadly fate of mortality. A high mortality rate of patients was reported with hospital-acquired septic shock that leads to multiple organ failures and ultimately ends with death. The patients who overcome this septic shock suffer from morbidity that also affects their caretakers. To overcome these situations, scientists are exploring progressive theragnostic techniques with advanced techniques based on biosensors, biomarkers, biozymes, vesicles, and others. These advanced techniques pave the novel way for early detection of sepsis-associated symptoms and timely treatment with appropriate antibiotics and immunomodulators and prevent the undue effect on other parts of the body. There are other techniques like externally modulated electric-based devices working on the principle of piezoelectric mechanism that not only sense the endotoxin levels but also target them with a loaded antibiotic to neutralize the onset of inflammatory response. Recently researchers have developed a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) neutralizing cartridge that not only senses the LPS but also appropriately neutralizes with dual mechanistic insights of antibiotic and anti-inflammatory effects. This review will highlight recent developments in the new nanotechnology-based approaches for the diagnosis and therapeutics of sepsis that is responsible for the high number of deaths of patients suffering from this critical disease.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since it was first recognized in December 2019, it has resulted in the ongoing worldwide pandemic. Although acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the main features of the disease, the involvement of other organs needs to be explored. There has been a growing concern regarding the association between acute kidney injury (AKI) and poor outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Based on current observational data, AKI is the 2nd most common cause of morbidity and mortality behind ARDS in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor has been shown to be the cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly plays a significant role in the occurrence of renal injury. The pathogenesis of AKI is likely multifactorial that involves not only direct viral invasion but also dysregulated immune response in the form of cytokine storm, ischemia to kidneys, hypercoagulable state, and rhabdomyolysis, among others. We performed a literature search of the Pubmed and Google Scholar database from 1996 to 2020 using the following keywords: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, and acute kidney injury to find the most pertinent and highest-quality of evidence. Any cited references were reviewed to identify relevant literature. The purpose of this review is to discuss, explore, and summarize the relationship between AKI in SARS-CoV-2 patients, with a focus on its epidemiology, association with ACE2 receptors, and pathophysiology of AKI.

AB  - Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) is a RIP1-targeted inhibitor of necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death discovered and investigated in recent years. There are already many studies demonstrating the essential role of necroptosis in various diseases, including inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases and neurological diseases. However, the potential of Nec-1 in diseases has not received much attention. Nec-1 is able to inhibit necroptosis signaling pathway and thus ameliorate necroptotic cell death in disease development. Recent research findings indicate that Nec-1 could be applied in several types of diseases to alleviate disease development or improve prognosis. Moreover, we predict that Nec-1 has the potential to protect against the complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review summarized the effect of Nec-1 in disease models and the underlying molecular mechanism, providing research evidence for its future application.

AB  - Summary
Although the individual and societal consequences of antibiotic resistance spiral upwards, coordinated action has not kept pace on a global scale. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for resilient health systems and has resulted in an unprecedented rate of collaboration in scientific, medical, social, and political dimensions. The pandemic has also created a renewed awareness of the importance of infectious diseases and is a substantial entry point for reigniting the momentum towards containing the silent pandemic of antibiotic resistance. In this Viewpoint, we discuss the limitations in the current narrative on antibiotic resistance and how it could be improved, including concerted efforts to close essential data gaps. We discuss the need for capacity building and coordination at the national and global levels to strengthen the understanding of the importance of sustainable access to effective antibiotics for all health systems that could generate tangible links to current processes for global health and development.

AB  - Individuals with kidney failure face a future requiring long-term treatment with either dialysis or renal transplantation. Renal transplantation is the preferred form of renal replacement therapy, and is associated with a better quality of life, and usually increased longevity. Unfortunately, owing to excessive co-morbidities, only 30% of patients who develop end-stage renal failure are fit enough for transplantation. Over 90% of kidney transplants still function after 1 year, and most function for >15 years. Improvements in transplant outcomes are attributable to advances in histocompatibility testing, organ procurement, organ preservation, surgical techniques and perioperative care. Long-term outcomes have shown only minor improvements over the last two decades, although this should be considered in the context of deteriorating organ quality as older deceased donors with increasing co-morbidity are used more often to satisfy the need for donor organs. An overall increase in deceased donor numbers has boosted transplant activity in the UK, and it is hoped this will continue with the adoption of the ‘opt-out’ consent system. Living donor activity remains stable, but the use of non-directed altruistic donation and the living donor exchange scheme have reduced the need for higher immunological risk incompatible transplantation. The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced transplant rates globally, although national transplant systems are now recovering.

AB  - The COVID-19 global pandemic of 2019–2020 pointedly revealed the lack of diagnostic solutions that are able to keep pace with the rapid spread of the virus. Despite the promise of decades of lab-on-a-chip research, no commercial products were available to deliver rapid results or enable testing in the field at the onset of the pandemic. In this critical review, we assess the current state of progress on the development of point-of-care technologies for the diagnosis of viral diseases that cause pandemics. While many previous reviews have reported on progress in various lab-on-a-chip technologies, here we address the literature from the perspective of the testing needs of a rapidly expanding pandemic. First, we recommend a set of requirements to heed when designing point-of-care diagnostic technologies to address the testing needs of a pandemic. We then review the current state of assay technologies with a focus on isothermal amplification and lateral-flow immunoassays. Though there is much progress on assay development, we argue that the largest roadblock to deployment exists in sample preparation. We summarize current approaches to automate sample preparation and discuss both the progress and shortcomings of these developments. Finally, we provide our recommendations to the field of specific challenges to address in order to prepare for the next pandemic.

AB  - Respiratory viral infections remain a scourge, with seasonal influenza infecting millions and killing many thousands annually and viral pandemics, such as COVID-19, recurring every decade. Age, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus are risk factors for severe disease and death from viral infection. Immunometabolic therapies for these populations hold promise to reduce the risks of death and disability. Such interventions have pleiotropic effects that might not only target the virus itself but also enhance supportive care to reduce cardiopulmonary complications, improve cognitive resilience, and facilitate functional recovery. Ketone bodies are endogenous metabolites that maintain cellular energy but also feature drug-like signaling activities that affect immune activity, metabolism, and epigenetics. Here, we provide an overview of ketone body biology relevant to respiratory viral infection, focusing on influenza A and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, and discuss the opportunities, risks, and research gaps in the study of exogenous ketone bodies as novel immunometabolic interventions in these diseases.

AB  - As a process entailing a high turnover of the host cell molecules, viral replication is required for a successful viral infection and requests virus capacity to acquire the macromolecules required for its propagation. To this end, viruses have adopted several strategies to harness cellular metabolism in accordance with their specific demands. Most viruses upregulate specific cellular anabolic pathways and are largely dependent on such alterations. RNA viruses, for example, upregulate both glycolysisand glycogenolysis providing TCA cycle intermediates essential for anabolic lipogenesis. Also, these infections usually induce the PPP, leading to increased nucleotide levels supporting viral replication. SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19)that has so far spread from China throughout the world is also an RNA virus. Owing to the more metabolic plasticity of uninfected cells, a promising approach for specific antiviral therapy, which has drawn a lot of attention in the recent years, would be the targeting of metabolic changes induced by viruses. In the current review, we first summarize some of virus-induced metabolic adaptations and then based on these information as well as SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, propose a potential therapeutic modality for this calamitous world-spreading virus with the hope of employing this strategy for near-future clinical application.

AB  - Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of self-harm was already on the rise. Hanging/suffocation accounted for 50% of the increase in suicide attempts and remains the second leading cause of death from self-harm in the United States. Studies on the management of near-hanging patients are lacking, and most published literature is retrospective. Following airway and circulation assessment, clinical examination and imaging, namely CT angiography, remain the standard for identifying the injuries associated with near hanging: cervical spine fracture, blunt cerebrovascular injury, laryngeal injury, and injury to the trachea and oropharynx. These injuries, however, are uncommon, and each occur in < 5% of patients in most series. In a large series of critically ill near-hanging patients, > 50% survived to hospital discharge; however, cardiac arrest predicted a poor outcome. The management of asphyxia-related arrest remains controversial. Targeted temperature management has only been studied in a single large multicenter trial, which was retrospective. Given the significant selection bias of targeted temperature management in the treatment of the most ill patients, no firm recommendations can be made. Finally, for survivors, the underlying mental health issues must be addressed to avoid recurrent suicide attempts. Thirty percent of patients in a large near-hanging series were admitted for their second suicide attempt.

AB  - In light of the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the international scientific community has joined forces to develop effective treatment strategies. The Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) 2, is an essential receptor for cell fusion and engulfs the SARS coronavirus infections. ACE2 plays an important physiological role, practically in all the organs and systems. Also, ACE2 exerts protective functions in various models of pathologies with acute and chronic inflammation. While ACE2 downregulation by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein leads to an overactivation of Angiotensin (Ang) II/AT1R axis and the deleterious effects of Ang II may explain the multiorgan dysfunction seen in patients. Specifically, the role of Ang II leading to the appearance of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) and the cytokine storm in COVID-19 is discussed below. In this review, we summarized the latest research progress in the strategies of treatments that mainly focus on reducing the Ang II-induced deleterious effects rather than attenuating the virus replication.
