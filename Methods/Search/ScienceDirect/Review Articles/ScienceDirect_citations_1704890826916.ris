AB  - Today, the entire world is battling to contain the spread of COVID-19. Massive efforts are being made to find a therapeutic solution in the shortest possible time. However, the research community is becoming increasingly concerned about taking a shortsighted strategy without contemplating the long-term consequences. For example, It has been reported that only 8.4% of total COVID-19 patients develop a secondary bacterial infection. In comparison, 74.6% of them are administered with antibiotics as prophylactic treatment. We contend that overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics increases the likelihood of AMR development and negatively affects the patient's recovery due to the prevalence of the "gut-lung axis.". Consequently, the use of antibiotics to treat COVID-19 patients must be rationalized, or an alternative treatment must be sought that does not risk contributing to AMR development and positively impacts the treatment outcomes. Phage therapy, a century-old concept, is one of the most promising approaches that can be adapted to serve this purpose. This review emphasizes the negative impact of excessive antibiotic use in COVID-19 treatment and provides an overview of how phage therapy can be used as an alternative treatment option. We have argued that targeted killing (narrow spectrum) and anti-inflammatory (which can target the primary cause of mortality in COVID-19) properties of phages can be an effective alternative to antibiotics.

AB  - Despite a recent endorsement from official and professional bodies unequivocally recommending COVID-19 vaccination, vaccine hesitancy among pregnant people remains high. The accumulated evidence demonstrates that pregnant people are a special risk group for COVID-19, with an increased risk of intensive care unit admission, extracorporeal membranous oxygenation requirement, preterm birth, and perinatal death. These risks are further increased with some variants of concern, and vaccination of pregnant people reduces the COVID-19–related increase in maternal or fetal morbidity. Data from more than 180,000 vaccinated persons show that immunization against COVID-19 with an mRNA vaccine is safe for pregnant people. Many observational studies comparing perinatal outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant people have had reassuring findings and did not demonstrate harmful effects on pregnancy or the newborn. Immunization with mRNA vaccines does not increase the risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, low birthweight, maternal or neonatal intensive care unit admission, fetal death, fetal abnormality, or pulmonary embolism. Moreover, observational data corroborate the findings of randomized trials that mRNA vaccination is highly effective at preventing severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant people, emphasizing that the potential maternal and fetal benefits of vaccination greatly outweigh the potential risks of vaccination. Ensuring pregnant people have unrestricted access to COVID-19 vaccination should be a priority in every country worldwide.

AB  - The exceptional outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has let the scientific community to work closely and quickly learnt things in a very short period of time. This has let us recognize that thromboembolic complications are responsible for morbidity and mortality among the COVID-19 infected patients. Available data have suggested a possible multifactorial basis of these complications, and while efforts are being made to treat this infection, preventive measures with the use of systemic anticoagulation were quickly adopted to deal with this issue. Despite obvious benefits as appeared with the use of systemic anticoagulation, most of the emerged data were retrospective, hence raise questions on the possible interplay of the confounders as well as long-term benefits and safety of systemic anticoagulation.

AB  - There are important questions surrounding the potential contribution of outdoor and indoor air quality in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and perpetuation of COVID-19 epidemic waves. Environmental health may be a critical component of COVID-19 prevention. The public health community and health agencies should consider the evolving evidence in their recommendations and statements, and work to issue occupational guidelines. Evidence coming from the current epidemiological and experimental research is expected to add knowledge about virus diffusion, COVID-19 severity in most polluted areas, inter-personal distance requirements and need for wearing face masks in indoor or outdoor environments. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for maintaining particulate matter concentrations at low levels for multiple health-related reasons, which may also include the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Indoor environments represent even a more crucial challenge to cope with, as it is easier for the SARS-COV2 to spread, remain vital and infect other subjects in closed spaces in the presence of already infected asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic people. The potential merits of preventive measures, such as CO2 monitoring associated with natural or controlled mechanical ventilation and air purification, for schools, indoor public places (restaurants, offices, hotels, museums, theatres/cinemas etc.) and transportations need to be carefully considered. Hospital settings and nursing/retirement homes as well as emergency rooms, infectious diseases divisions and ambulances represent higher risk indoor environments and may require additional monitoring and specific decontamination strategies based on mechanical ventilation or air purification.

AB  - The highly transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen of the COVID-19 pandemic, bring new waves of infection worldwide. Identification of effective therapeutic drugs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent global need. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), an essential enzyme for viral RNA replication, is the most promising target for antiviral drug research since it has no counterpart in human cells and shows the highest conservation across coronaviruses. This review summarizes recent progress in studies of RdRp inhibitors, focusing on interactions between these inhibitors and the enzyme complex, based on structural analysis, and their effectiveness. In addition, we propose new possible strategies to address the shortcomings of current inhibitors, which may guide the development of novel efficient inhibitors to combat COVID-19.

AB  - There is concern that people with rheumatic disease, often treated with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medication, may be at an increased risk of poor outcomes of novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). However, hyperinflammation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 and treatment with glucocorticoids has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19. Therefore, uncertainty exists about continuing or withholding immune therapies with the risk of infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This review covers the current knowledge with respect to the risk of infection and outcomes and risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with rheumatic disease. We also discuss data from other immune-mediated diseases and its relevance to patients with rheumatic disease. In addition, we cover the limitations of the research efforts to date and how the current knowledge translates into practice guidance. Finally, we discuss our vision of the future research agenda.

AB  - In December 2019, the world was introduced to a new betacoronavirus, referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) for its propensity to cause rapidly progressive lung damage, resulting in high death rates. As fast as the virus spread, it became evident that the novel coronavirus causes a multisystem disease (COVID‐19) that may involve multiple organs and has a high risk of thrombosis associated with striking elevations in pro‐inflammatory cytokines, D‐dimer, and fibrinogen, but without disseminated intravascular coagulation. Postmortem studies have confirmed the high incidence of venous thromboembolism, but also notably revealed diffuse microvascular thrombi with endothelial swelling, consistent with a thrombotic microangiopathy, and inter‐alveolar endothelial deposits of complement activation fragments. The clinicopathologic presentation of COVID‐19 thus parallels that of other thrombotic diseases, such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), that are caused by dysregulation of the complement system. This raises the specter that many of the thrombotic complications arising from SARS‐CoV‐2 infections may be triggered and/or exacerbated by excess complement activation. This is of major potential clinical relevance, as currently available anti‐complement therapies that are highly effective in protecting against thrombosis in aHUS, could be efficacious in COVID‐19. In this review, we provide mounting evidence for complement participating in the pathophysiology underlying the thrombotic diathesis associated with pathogenic coronaviruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2. Based on current knowledge of complement, coagulation and the virus, we suggest lines of study to identify novel therapeutic targets and the rationale for clinical trials with currently available anti‐complement agents for COVID‐19.

AB  - The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global pandemic that requires a multi-faceted approach to tackle this unprecedent health crisis. Therapeutics to treat COVID-19 are an integral part of any such management strategy and there is a substantial unmet need for treatments for individuals most at risk of severe disease. This perspective review provides rationale of a combined therapeutic regimen of selective endothelin-A (ET-A) receptor antagonism and sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition to treat COVID-19. Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor with pro-inflammatory and atherosclerotic effects. It is upregulated in a number of conditions including acute respiratory distress syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Endothelin mediates vasocontractility via endothelin (ET-A and ET-B) receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). ET-B receptors regulate endothelin clearance and are present on endothelial cells, where in contrast to their role on VSMCs, mediate vasodilation. Therefore, selective endothelin-A (ET-A) receptor inhibition is likely the optimal approach to attenuate the injurious effects of endothelin and may reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatch and pulmonary inflammation, whilst improving pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygenation. SGLT-2 inhibition may dampen inflammatory cytokines, reduce hyperglycaemia if present, improve endothelial function, cardiovascular haemodynamics and cellular bioenergetics. This combination therapeutic approach may therefore have beneficial effects to mitigate both the pulmonary, metabolic and cardiorenal manifestations of COVID-19. Given these drug classes include medicines licensed to treat heart failure, diabetes and pulmonary hypertension respectively, information regarding their safety profile is established. Randomised controlled clinical trials are the best way to determine efficacy and safety of these medicines in COVID-19.

AB  - A Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic disease named Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) of epochal dimension. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is wide, ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe pneumonia, sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes resulting in poor outcomes. Among the various consequences of severe COVID-19, cardiovascular (CV) collapse appears the most serious and potentially lethal. On the other hand, pre-existent CV comorbidities are also associated with higher mortality. The most reliable hypothetical pathogenetic mechanism for CV complications and cardiac injury in severe COVID-19 patients appears to be a sustained endothelial dysfunction, caused by the interplay of inflammation and coagulation. In this review, we survey papers addressing issues related to severe COVID-19, characterized by enhanced lung microvascular loss, hypercytokinemia, hypoxemia and thrombosis. We discuss about how the virus-induced downregulation of the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, used to enter the host cell, could affect the renin-angiotensin system, attempting to clarify the doubts about the use of ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin-II receptor blockers in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we point out how the delicate and physiological homeostatic function of the endothelium, which turns into a disastrous battlefield of the complex interaction between “cytokine and coagulative storms”, can be irreparably compromised and result in systemic inflammatory complications.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic is the more challenging public health emergency of the century, producing the collapse of health systems and unprecedented levels of morbidity and mortality around the world, especially in low resource settings. Patients with chronic diseases are the most affected, not only due to the high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection but also due to the decrease in opportunities for timely care. In this dark landscape, telemedicine, before limited to very specific scenarios, has become one of our main tools to manage cancer patients, particularly in Latin America where COVID-19 has had a strong impact on the public health. Telemedicine can provide rapid access to specialized cancer care in a scenario complicated, reducing the exposure of patients and healthcare personnel to the SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we would like to share our experience and our workflow using telemedicine at Oncosalud-AUNA, a private clinic in Peru.

AB  - Background
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) triggers the development of numerous pathologies and infection-linked complications and exacerbates existing pathologies in nearly all body systems. Aside from the primarily targeted respiratory organs, adverse SARS-CoV-2 effects were observed in nervous, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/metabolic, immune, and other systems in COVID-19 survivors. Long-term effects of this viral infection have been recently observed and represent distressing sequelae recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a distinct clinical entity defined as post-COVID-19 condition. Considering the pandemic is still ongoing, more time is required to confirm post COVID-19 condition diagnosis in the COVID-19 infected cohorts, although many reported post COVID-19 symptoms overlap with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).
Aims of Review
In this study, COVID-19 clinical presentation and associated post-infection sequelae (post-COVID-19 condition) were reviewed and compared with ME/CFS symptomatology.
Key Scientific Concepts of Review
The onset, progression, and symptom profile of post COVID-19 condition patients have considerable overlap with ME/CFS. Considering the large scope and range of pro-inflammatory effects of this virus, it is reasonable to expect development of post COVID-19 clinical complications in a proportion of the affected population. There are reports of a later debilitating syndrome onset three months post COVID-19 infection (often described as long-COVID-19), marked by the presence of fatigue, headache, cognitive dysfunction, post-exertional malaise, orthostatic intolerance, and dyspnoea. Acute inflammation, oxidative stress, and increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Longitudinal monitoring of post COVID-19 patients is warranted to understand the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pathomechanism of post COVID-19 condition.

AB  - Patients admitted to the ICU with critical COVID-19 often require prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation. Difficulty weaning, lack of progress, and clinical deterioration are commonly encountered. These conditions should prompt a thorough evaluation for persistent or untreated manifestations of COVID-19, as well as complications from COVID-19 and its various treatments. Inflammation may persist and lead to fibroproliferative changes in the lungs. Infectious complications may arise including bacterial superinfection in the earlier stages of disease. Use of immunosuppressants may lead to the dissemination of latent infections, and to opportunistic infections. Venous thromboembolic disease is common, as are certain neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 including delirium and stroke. High levels of ventilatory support may lead to ventilator-induced injury to the lungs and diaphragm. We present diagnostic and therapeutic considerations for the mechanically ventilated patient with COVID-19 who shows persistent or worsening signs of critical illness, and we offer an approach to treating this complex but common scenario.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis. Little is known about the protective factors of this infection. Therefore, preventive health measures that can reduce the risk of infection, progression and severity are desperately needed. This review discussed the possible roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory tract infections and severity. Moreover, this study determined the correlation of vitamin D levels with COVID-19 cases and deaths in 20 European countries as of 20 May 2020. A significant negative correlation (p=0.033) has been observed between mean vitamin D levels and COVID-19 cases per one million population in European countries. However, the correlation of vitamin D with COVID-19 deaths of these countries was not significant. Some retrospective studies demonstrated a correlation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality, while other studies did not find the correlation when confounding variables are adjusted. Several studies demonstrated the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of acute viral respiratory tract infections and pneumonia. These include direct inhibition with viral replication or with anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory ways. In the meta-analysis, vitamin D supplementation has been shown as safe and effective against acute respiratory tract infections. Thus, people who are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency during this global pandemic should consider taking vitamin D supplements to maintain the circulating 25(OH)D in the optimal levels (75–125nmol/L). In conclusion, there is not enough evidence on the association between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 severity and mortality. Therefore, randomized control trials and cohort studies are necessary to test this hypothesis.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has pushed the medical system to its breaking point. While the virus does not discriminate, the elderly and those with comorbidities, including hypertension severe obesity, diabetes mellitus, coronary disease, pneumonia and dementia, are at a greater risk for adverse outcomes due to COVID-19. While many people navigate their new normal, the question of what the long-lasting effects of the pandemic may be, lingers. To investigate how vulnerable populations are affected by the pandemic, we focused on Alzheimer’s disease, a vector to understanding how the virus has impacted AD progression and risk via aging. By assessing the effect of COVID-19 on AD patients, we explore genetics, metabolism, and lifestyle factors in both COVID-19 and Alzheimer’s disease that can work synergistically to precipitate adverse outcomes. This article also discusses how age-related conditions and/or age-related comorbidities susceptible to COVID-19. We also discuss possible healthy lifestyle factors reduce and/or combat COVID-19 now and in the future.

AB  - Background
SARS-CoV-2 has led to a sharp increase in the number of hospitalizations and deaths from pneumonia and multiorgan disease worldwide; therefore, SARS-CoV-2 has become a global health problem. Supportive therapies remain the mainstay treatments against COVID-19, such as oxygen inhalation, antiviral drugs, and antibiotics. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been shown clinically to relieve the symptoms of COVID-19 infection, and TCMs can affect the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Jing Si Herbal Drink (JSHD), an eight herb formula jointly developed by Tzu Chi University and Tzu Chi Hospital, has shown potential as an adjuvant treatment for COVID-19 infection. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of JSHD as an adjuvant treatment in patients with COVID-19 infection is underway
Objectives
This article aims to explore the efficacy of the herbs in JSHD against COVID-19 infection from a mechanistic standpoint and provide a reference for the rational utilization of JSHD in the treatment of COVID-19.
Method
We compiled evidence of the herbs in JSHD to treat COVID-19 in vivo and in vitro.
Results
We described the efficacy and mechanism of action of the active ingredients in JSHD to treat COVID-19 based on experimental evidence. JSHD includes 5 antiviral herbs, 7 antioxidant herbs, and 7 anti-inflammatory herbs. In addition, 2 herbs inhibit the overactive immune system, 1 herb reduces cell apoptosis, and 1 herb possesses antithrombotic ability.
Conclusion
Although experimental data have confirmed that the ingredients in JSHD are effective against COVID-19, more rigorously designed studies are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of JSHD as a COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, emerged as the deadliest outbreak that has now become a serious health issue to mankind. Activation of inflammatory signaling pathways and cytokine storm are crucial factors that lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. Excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines leads to the dysregulation of the innate immune system. The cytokine storm attracts many inflammatory cells that infiltrate into the lung tissues and ultimately cause immune damage. In addition to the dysregulation of the immune system, dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) due to the downregulation of ACE2 is also associated with the mortality of COVID-19 patients. Both the mechanisms are directly or indirectly associated with cytokine storm that promotes vascular hyperpermeability, vascular edema leading to hypercoagulation and hence multiorgan damage. As of now, there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19, but scientists have purposed several treatment options including cytokine inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, immunomodulators, plasma therapy, etc. In this article, we have provided the detailed mechanism of occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory storm and its connection with the pre-existing inflammatory conditions. Possible treatment options to cope up with the severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are also discussed.

AB  - Ferritin, which includes twenty-four light and heavy chains in varying proportions in different tissues, is primarily responsible for maintaining the body's iron metabolism. Its normal value is between 10 and 200 ngmL−1 in men and between 30 and 300 ngmL−1 in women. Iron is delivered to the tissue via them, and they act as immunomodulators, signaling molecules, and inflammatory markers. When ferritin level exceeds 1000 µgL-1, the patient is categorized as having hyperferritinemia. Iron chelators such as deferiprone, deferirox, and deferoxamine are currently FDA approved to treat iron overload. The inflammation cascade and poor prognosis of COVID-19 may be attributed to high ferritin levels. Critically ill patients can benefit from deferasirox, an iron chelator administered orally at 20–40 mgkg−1 once daily, as well as intravenous deferoxamine at 1000 mg initially followed by 500 mg every 4 to 12 h. It can be combined with monoclonal antibodies, antioxidants, corticosteroids, and lactoferrin to make iron chelation therapy effective for COVID-19 victims. In this article, we analyze the antiviral and antifibrotic activity of iron chelators, thereby promoting iron depletion therapy as a potentially innovative treatment strategy for COVID-19.

AB  - Since December 2019 SARS-CoV-2 infections have affected millions of people worldwide. Along with the increasing number of COVID-19 patients, the number of cases of opportunistic fungal infections among the COVID-19 patients is also increasing. There have been reports of the cases of aspergillosis and candidiasis in the COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 patients have also been affected by rare fungal infections such as histoplasmosis, pneumocystosis, mucormycosis and cryptococcosis. These fungal infections are prolonging the stay of COVID-19 patients in hospital. In this study several published case reports, case series, prospective and retrospective studies were investigated to explore and report the updated information regarding candidiasis, crytptococcosis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, histoplasmosis, and pneumocystosis infections in COVID-19 patients. In this review, the risk factors of these co-infections in COVID-19 patients have been reported. There have been reports that the comorbidities and the treatment with corticoids, monoclonal antibodies, use of mechanical ventilation, and use of antibiotics during COVID-19 management are associated with the emergence of fungal infections in the COVID-19 patients. Hence, this review analyses the role of these therapies and comorbidities in the emergence of these fungal infections among COVID-19 patients. This review will help to comprehend if these fungal infections are the result of the co-morbidities, and treatment protocol followed to manage COVID-19 patients or directly due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The analysis of all these factors will help to understand their role in fungal infections among COVID-19 patients which can be valuable to the scientific community.

AB  - Identifying signaling pathways and molecules involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is pivotal for developing new effective therapeutic or preventive strategies for COVID-19. Pannexins (PANX) are ATP-release channels in the plasma membrane essential in many physiological and immune responses. Activation of pannexin channels and downstream purinergic receptors play dual roles in viral infection, either by facilitating viral replication and infection or inducing host antiviral defense. The current review provides a hypothesis demonstrating the possible contribution of the PANX1 channel and purinergic receptors in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and mechanism of action. Moreover, we discuss whether targeting these signaling pathways may provide promising preventative therapies and treatments for patients with progressive COVID-19 resulting from excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines production. Several inhibitors of this pathway have been developed for the treatment of other viral infections and pathological consequences. Specific PANX1 inhibitors could be potentially included as part of the COVID-19 treatment regimen if, in future, studies demonstrate the role of PANX1 in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Of note, any ATP therapeutic modulation for COVID-19 should be carefully designed and monitored because of the complex role of extracellular ATP in cellular physiology.

AB  - Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predominantly disrupts the respiratory system, there is accumulating experience that the disease, particularly in its more severe manifestations, also affects the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular risk factors and chronic cardiovascular conditions are prevalent among patients affected by COVID-19 and associated with adverse outcomes. However, whether pre-existing cardiovascular disease is an independent determinant of higher mortality risk with COVID-19 remains uncertain. Acute cardiac injury, manifest by increased blood levels of cardiac troponin, electrocardiographic abnormalities, or myocardial dysfunction, occurs in up to ~60% of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Potential contributors to acute cardiac injury in the setting of COVID-19 include (1) acute changes in myocardial demand and supply due to tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxemia resulting in type 2 myocardial infarction; (2) acute coronary syndrome due to acute atherothrombosis in a virally induced thrombotic and inflammatory milieu; (3) microvascular dysfunction due to diffuse microthrombi or vascular injury; (4) stress-related cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo syndrome); (5) nonischemic myocardial injury due to a hyperinflammatory cytokine storm; or (6) direct viral cardiomyocyte toxicity and myocarditis. Diffuse thrombosis is emerging as an important contributor to adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Practitioners should be vigilant for cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. Monitoring may include serial cardiac troponin and natriuretic peptides, along with fibrinogen, D-dimer, and inflammatory biomarkers. Management decisions should rely on the clinical assessment for the probability of ongoing myocardial ischemia, as well as alternative nonischemic causes of injury, integrating the level of suspicion for COVID-19.

AB  - Introduction
In addition to the directly attributed mortality, COVID-19 is also likely to increase mortality indirectly. In this systematic review, we investigate the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 on out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.
Methods
We searched PubMed, BioMedCentral, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies comparing out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occurring during the pandemic and a non-pandemic period. Risk of bias was assessed with the ROBINS-I tool. The primary endpoint was return of spontaneous circulation. Secondary endpoints were bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, survival to hospital discharge, and survival with favourable neurological outcome.
Results
We identified six studies. In two studies, rates of return of spontaneous circulation and survival to hospital discharge decreased significantly during the pandemic. Especially in Europe, bystander-witnessed cases, bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation and resuscitation attempted by emergency medical services were reduced during the pandemic. Also, ambulance response times were significantly delayed across all studies and patients presenting with non-shockable rhythms increased in two studies. In 2020, 3.9–5.9% of tested patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 4.8–26% had suggestive symptoms (fever and cough or dyspnoea).
Conclusions
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests had worse short-term outcomes during the pandemic than a non-pandemic period suggesting direct effects of COVID-19 infection and indirect effects from lockdown and disruption of healthcare systems. Patients at high risk of deterioration should be identified outside the hospital to promptly initiate treatment and reduce fatalities. Study registration PROSPERO CRD42020195794.

AB  - Emerging data show that the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 are being disproportionately borne by individuals who are not only biologically, but also socially vulnerable. Based on preliminary data from Sweden and other reports, in this paper we propose a conceptual framework whereby different factors related to biological and social vulnerability may explain the specific COVID-19 burden among older people. There is already some evidence showing large social disparities in the prevention, treatment, prognosis and/or long-term consequences of COVID-19. The remaining question is to what extent these affect older adults specifically. We provide the rationale to address this question with scientific methods and proper study designs, where the interplay between individuals’ biomedical status and their social environment is the focus. Only through interdisciplinary research integrating biological, clinical and social data will we be able to provide new insights into the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and inform actions aimed at reducing older adults’ vulnerability to COVID-19 or other similar pandemics in the future.

We conducted a consensus critical review using primary sources, scientific articles, and secondary bibliographic indexes, databases, and web pages. The method was a narrative literature review of the available literature regarding physical activity and physical activity related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main online database used in the present research were PubMed, SciELO, and Google Scholar. COVID-19 has negatively influenced motor behavior, levels of regular exercise practice, eating and nutritional patterns, and the psychological status of citizens. These factors feed into each other, worsening COVID-19 symptoms, the risk of death from SARS-CoV-2, and the symptoms and effectiveness of the vaccine. The characteristics and symptoms related with the actual COVID-19 pandemic made the physical activity interventions a valuable prevention and treatment factor.

AB  - Obesity has rapidly become a significant public health issue. As the prevalence of obesity continues to rise, so does its economic burden as a result of both direct and indirect costs. Likewise, since 2019, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic with rising infection rates carrying significant economic costs associated with treatment of the disease and the reduction in economic activity due to government regulations. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a detrimental impact on obesity, not only creating an increasingly obesogenic environment but also reducing access to bariatric care and treatment of obesity-related diseases. In this article, we form a compelling argument for the resumption of bariatric services as soon as it is safe to do so because bariatric surgery brings significant additional medical and economic benefits. Medically, obesity is a risk factor for increased severity of COVID-19 infections, and therefore, treatment of obesity should be a priority in the current pandemic. Additionally, bariatric surgery has been shown to be a cost-saving procedure in the long term and thus has significant economic benefit in reducing the costs of obesity in the future as we recover from the economic collapse following the global pandemic.

AB  - A novel coronavirus termed as COVID-19 by WHO has been the causative agent of an unprecedented pandemic in the history of humanity. The global burden of mortality and morbidity associated with this pandemic continues to increase with each passing day as it is progressively leading to multiorgan dysfunction. In most cases, the cause of death has been attributed to respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiac failure, kidney injury, or coagulopathy. As more knowledge is being unfolded, an in-depth understanding of various systemic manifestations and complications of SARS-CoV2 is vital for optimum management of these patients. This novel virus is known to spread faster than its two ancestors, the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), demonstrating a case fatality ranging from 5 to 8% [1]. Hematological abnormalities such as lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated D-Dimer, elevated fibrinogen, elevated fibrinogen degradation products as well as cytokines such as IL-6 are emerging as important prognostic marker for worse outcome of COVID-19. Among various systemic manifestations, hematological complications such as venous thrombosis causing pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, and arterial thrombosis causing myocardial infarction, strokes or limb ischemia are being noted to be directly linked to high mortality from COVID-19. An attempt to understand the pathophysiology of various hematological abnormalities including cytokine storm, hypercoagulable state and some rare presentations of this disease hence becomes imperative. Through this review, we aim to provide an up-to-date summary of current evidence-based literature of hematological manifestations, their consequences and management including role of anticoagulation and drugs targeting cytokine storm in patients with SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Purpose of review: Although the respiratory system is the main target of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it is evident from recent data that other systems, especially cardiovascular and hematological, are also significantly affected. In fact, in severe form, COVID-19 causes a systemic illness with widespread inflammation and cytokine flood, resulting in severe cardiovascular injury. Therefore, we reviewed cardiac injury biomarkers' role in various cardiovascular complications of COVID 19 in recent studies. Recent findings: Cardiac injury biomarkers were elevated in most of the complicated cases of COVID-19, and their elevation is directly proportional to the worst outcome. Evaluation of cardiac biomarkers with markers of other organ damage gives a more reliable tool for case fatalities and future outcome. Summary: Significant association of cardiac biomarkers in COVID-19 cases helps disease management and prognosis, especially in severely ill patients.

AB  - Obesity is increasingly prevalent worldwide. Associated risk factors, including depression, socioeconomic stress, poor diet, and lack of physical activity, have all been impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This systematic review aims to explore the indirect effects of the first year of COVID-19 on obesity and its risk factors. A literature search of PubMed and EMBASE was performed from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 to identify relevant studies pertaining to the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (PROSPERO; CRD42020219433). All English-language studies on weight change and key obesity risk factors (psychosocial and socioeconomic health) during the COVID-19 pandemic were considered for inclusion. Of 805 full-text articles that were reviewed, 87 were included for analysis. The included studies observed increased food and alcohol consumption, increased sedentary time, worsening depressive symptoms, and increased financial stress. Overall, these results suggest that COVID-19 has exacerbated the current risk factors for obesity and is likely to worsen obesity rates in the near future. Future studies, and policy makers, will need to carefully consider their interdependency to develop effective interventions able to mitigate the obesity pandemic.

AB  - Family caregivers in Canadian long-term care homes are estimated to provide 10 h per week of direct care to approximately 30% of residents through roles including mobility support, mealtime assistance, personal care, social interaction, psychological care, care coordination, and advocacy. Despite these contributions, they continue to be viewed as visitors rather than as key participants in the interdependent relationships that support the long-term care sector. Their marginalization was evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, as Canadian public health policy focused on preventing them from entering long-term care, rather than supporting personal risk management, symptom screening, personal protective equipment, and other mechanisms for safe involvement in care. Several iatrogenic resident outcomes have been attributed to this, including decreased cognitive function, decreased mobility, increased incontinence, weight loss, increased depression and anxiety, increased responsive behaviours amongst those living with dementia, and increased delirium. In this commentary article, we argue that family caregiver presence was conflated as a risk when instead, it contributed to unintended harm. We identify nine well-known human social cognitive predispositions that may have contributed to this. We then examine their implications for trust in long-term care, and consider how quality and safety can be further fostered in long-term care by working in partnership with family caregivers to rebuild trust through enquiry and collaboration. We advocate incorporating trust as an essential measure of quality health service.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a current pandemic that has resulted in nearly 250 million cases and over 5 million deaths. While vaccines have been developed to prevent infection, and most COVID-19 cases end up being fairly light, there are severe cases of COVID-19 that may end up in death, even with adequate healthcare treatment. New options to combat this disease’s effects, therefore, could prove to be invaluable in saving lives. Adamalysins are proteins that have several roles in regulating different functions in the human body but are also known to have functions in inflammation. They are also known to have roles in several different diseases, including COVID-19, where ADAM17, in particular, is now well-known to have a prominent role, but also several diseases which include comorbidities that may worsen cases of COVID-19. Therefore, investigating the functions of adamalysins in disease may give us clues to the molecular workings of COVID-19 as well as potentially new therapeutic targets. Understanding these molecular mechanisms may also allow for an understanding of the mechanisms behind the rare severe side effects that occur in response to current COVID-19 vaccines, which may lead to better monitoring measures for people who may be more at risk of developing these side effects. This review investigates the known roles and functions of adamalysins in disease, including what is currently known of their involvement in COVID-19, and how these functions might be involved.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 is considered the most critical health pandemic of 21st century. Due to extremely high transmission rate, people are more susceptible to viral infection. COVID-19 patients having chronic type-2 asthma prevails a major risk as it may aggravate the disease and morbidities.
Objective
The present review mainly focuses on correlating the influence of COVID-19 in type-2 asthmatic patients. Besides, it delineates the treatment measures and drugs that can be used to manage mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of COVID-19 in asthmatic patients, thus preventing any exacerbation.
Methods
An in-depth research was carried out from different peer-reviewed articles till September 2020 from several renowned databases like PubMed, Frontier, MEDLINE, and related websites like WHO, CDC, MOHFW, and the information was analysed and written in a simplified manner.
Results
The progressive results were quite conflicting as severe cases of COVID-19 shows an increase in the level of several cytokines that can augment inflammation to the bronchial tracts, worsening the asthma attacks. Contradicting to this, certain findings reveal the decrease in the severity of COVID-19 due to the elevation of T-cells in type-2 asthmatic patients, as prominent reduction of T-cell is seen in most of the COVID-19 positive patients. This helps to counteract the balance of immune responses and hence ameliorate the disease progression.
Conclusion
Asthmatic patients must remain cautious during the COVID-19 pandemic by maintaining all the precautions to stay safe due to limited research data. Future strategies should include a better understanding of asthmatic exacerbation and its relation to COVID-19.

AB  - Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a new highly infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus. Recently, the number of new cases infected pneumonia in the world continues to increase, which has aroused great concern from the international community. At present, there are no small-molecule specific anti-viral drugs for the treatment. The high mortality rate seriously threatens human health. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a unique health resource in China. The combination of TCM and Western medicine has played a positive and important role in combating COVID-19 in China. In this review, through literature mining and analysis, it was found that TCM has the potential to prevent and treat the COVID-19. Then, the network pharmacological studies demonstrated that TCM played roles of anti-virus, anti-inflammation and immunoregulation in the management of COVID-19 via multiple components acting on multiple targets and multiple pathways. Finally, clinical researches also confirmed the beneficial effects of TCM on the treatment of patients. This review may provide meaningful and useful information on further drug development of COVID-19 and other viral infectious diseases.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly emerged as one of the biggest public health concerns of the 21st century. Although it was initially reported as a cluster of pneumonia cases, it quickly became apparent that COVID-19 is not merely a respiratory tract infection. Its clinical course is often complicated by cardiovascular manifestations including venous and arterial thrombosis, electrical disturbances, and myocardial damage. In addition, the cardiovascular system is involved not only during infection but also preceding the contraction of the virus; having cardiovascular comorbidities indicates significant vulnerability to the pathogen. As longer-term data continue to accumulate, we now have concerns over its lasting cardiovascular effects after recovery. Moreover, there have been substantial collateral effects on the epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases. Reports of adverse cardiovascular events from vaccination have emerged as new hurdles to our efforts to bring an end to the pandemic. As such, the association between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system and cardiovascular practice in general is expansive. In this review, we provide an overview of the knowledge and considerations in this field, based on the evidence available at the time of this writing.

AB  - Post COVID-19, mucormycosis occurred after the SARS-CoV-2 has rampaged the human population and is a scorching problem among the pandemic globally, particularly among Asian countries. Invasive mucormycosis has been extensively reported from mild to severe COVID-19 survivors. The robust predisposing factor seems to be uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, comorbidity and immunosuppression acquired through steroid therapy. The prime susceptive reason for the increase of mucormycosis cases is elevated iron levels in the serum of the COVID survivors. A panoramic understanding of the infection has been elucidated based on clinical manifestation, genetic and non- genetic mechanisms of steroid drug administration, biochemical pathways and immune modulated receptor associations. This review lime-lights and addresses the “What”, “Why”, “How” and “When” about the COVID-19 associated mucormycosis (CAM) in a comprehensive manner with a pure intention to bring about awareness to the common public as the cases are inevitably and exponentially increasing in India and global countries as well. The article also unearthed the pathogenesis of mucormycosis and its association with the COVID-19 sequela, the plausible routes of entry, diagnosis and counter remedies to keep the infection at bay. Cohorts of case reports were analysed to spotlight the link between the pandemic COVID-19 and the nightmare-mucormycosis.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a transformational impact on public policy as governments played a leading role, working alongside and coordinating with business/industry, healthcare, public health, education, transportation, researchers, non-governmental organizations, philanthropy, and media/communications. This paper summarizes the impact of the pandemic on different areas of public policy affecting healthy living and cardiovascular health including prevention (i.e., nutrition, physical activity, air quality, tobacco use), risk factors for chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, substance abuse), access to health care, care delivery and payment reform, telehealth and digital health, research, and employment policy. The paper underscores where public policy is evolving and where there are needs for future evidence base to inform policy development, and the intersections between the public and private sectors across the policy continuum. There is a continued need for global multi-sector coordination to optimize population health.

AB  - The objective of this systematic review is to give a comprehensive interpretation of menstrual cycle changes after the COVID-19 vaccination. Additionally, it is imperative to assess reports of menstrual changes following vaccination to dispel concerns that COVID-19 vaccines hinder the likelihood of pregnancy in the long run. A literature review was conducted using digital databases to systematically identify the studies reporting any menstrual abnormalities after the COVID-19 vaccine. Detailed patient-level study characteristics including the type of study, sample size, administered vaccines, and menstrual abnormalities were abstracted. A total of 78 138 vaccinated females were included in this review from 14 studies. Of these, 39 759 (52.05%) had some form of a menstrual problem after vaccination. Due to the lack of published research articles, preprints were also included in this review. Menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and polymenorrhea were the most commonly observed problems and the overall study-level rate of menstrual abnormality ranged from 0.83% to 90.9%. Age, history of pregnancy, systemic side-effects of COVID-19, smoking, and second dose of COVID-19 vaccine were predictors of menstrual problems after vaccination.
Resumen
Alteraciones menstruales tras la vacunación contra la COVID-19: revisión sistemática Resumen El objetivo de esta revisión sistemática es aportar una interpretación amplia sobre los cambios de los ciclos menstruales tras la vacunación contra la COVID-19. Además, es imperativo evaluar los informes sobre los cambios menstruales tras la vacunación, para disipar preocupaciones en cuanto a que las vacunas contra la COVID-19 dificultan la probabilidad de embarazo a largo plazo. Se realizó una revisión de la literatura utilizando bases de datos digitales para identificar sistemáticamente los estudios que reportan cualquier alteración menstrual tras la vacuna contra la COVID-19. Se resumieron las características detalladas del estudio al nivel del paciente, incluyendo tipo de estudio, tamaño de la muestra, vacunas administradas, y alteraciones menstruales. Se incluyó en la revisión a un total de 78 138 mujeres vacunadas, procedentes de 14 estudios. De ellas, 39 759 (52,05%) tuvieron algún tipo de problema menstrual tras la vacunación. Debido a la falta de artículos de investigación publicados, también se incluyeron preimpresos en esta revisión. Menorragia, metrorragia, y polimenorrea fueron los problemas más comúnmente observados, oscilando la tasa global de alteraciones menstruales a nivel de estudios entre el 0,83 y el 90,9%. La edad, los antecedentes de embarazos, los efectos secundarios sistémicos de la COVID-19, el tabaquismo y la segunda dosis de la vacuna contra la COVID-19 fueron factores predictivos de problemas menstruales tras la vacunación.

AB  - COVID-19 spreads via aerosols, droplets, fomites and faeces. The built environment that facilitates crowding increases exposure and hence transmission of COVID-19 as evidenced by outbreaks in both cool-dry and hot-humid climates, such as in the US prison system and dormitories in Singapore, respectively. This paper explores how the built environment influences crowding and COVID-19 transmission, focusing on informal urban settlements (slums). We propose policy and practice changes that could reduce COVID-19 transmission. There are several issues on how COVID-19 affects informal urban settlements. Slum populations tend to be younger than the overall population. Lower numbers of older people lessen the morbidity and mortality of the pandemic in slum areas. Second, many slum populations are highly mobile. By returning to their ancestral villages residents can avoid the risks of overcrowding and reduce the population density in a given area but may spread COVID-19 to other areas. Third, detection and registration of COVID-19 cases depends on patients presenting to health care providers. If the risk of visiting a health care centre outweighs the potential benefits patients may prefer not to seek treatment. The control and prevention of COVID-19 in informal urban settlements starts with organizing community infrastructure for diagnosis and treatment and assuring that basic needs (food, water, sanitation, health care and public transport) are met during quarantine. Next, community members at highest risk need to be identified and protected. Low-income, informal settlements need to be recognized as a reservoir and source for persistent transmission. Solutions to overcrowding must be developed for this and future pandemics. In view of the constant risk that slums present to the entire population decisive steps need to be taken to rehabilitate and improve informal settlements, while avoiding stigmatization.

AB  - Summary
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a significant surge of critically ill patients and an unprecedented demand on intensive care services. The rapidly evolving understanding of pathogenesis, limited disease specific evidence, and demand-resource imbalances have posed significant challenges for intensive care clinicians. COVID-19 is a complex multisystem inflammatory vasculopathy with a significant mortality implication for those admitted to intensive care. Institutional strategic preparation and meticulous intensive care support are essential to maximising outcomes during the pandemic. The significant mortality variation observed between institutions and internationally, despite a single aetiology and uniform presentation, highlights the potential influence of management strategies on outcome. Given that optimal organ support and adjunctive therapies for COVID-19 have not yet been well defined by trial-based outcomes, strategies are predicated on existing literature and experiential learning. This review outlines the relevant pathophysiology and management strategies for critically ill patients with COVID-19, and shares some of the collective learning accumulated in a high volume severe respiratory failure centre in London.

AB  - Summary
SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis can quickly strike to incapacitate the lung, leading to severe disease and sometimes death. In this perspective, we suggest that vitamin D deficiency and the failure to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR) can aggravate this respiratory syndrome by igniting a wounding response in stellate cells of the lung. The FDA-approved injectable vitamin D analog, paricalcitol, suppresses stellate cell-derived murine hepatic and pancreatic pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic changes. Therefore, we suggest a possible parallel program in the pulmonary stellate cells of COVID-19 patients and propose repurposing paricalcitol infusion therapy to restrain the COVID-19 cytokine storm. This proposed therapy could prove important to people of color who have higher COVID-19 mortality rates and lower vitamin D levels.

The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus which causes COVID-19 has unified the scientific community in search of therapeutic and preventative solutions. The top priorities at the moment are twofold: first, to repurpose already-approved pharmacologic agents or develop novel therapies to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the ever-spreading virus. Secondly, the scientific and larger pharmaceutical community have been tasked with the development, testing, and production of a safe and effective vaccine as a longer-term solution to prevent further spread and recurrence throughout the populace. The purpose of this article is to review the most up-to-date published data regarding both the leading pharmacological therapies undergoing clinical trials and vaccine candidates in development to stem the threat of COVID-19.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is challenging in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of diabetes patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two- to threefold higher, and the mortality rate at least double, than that of non-diabetes patients. As the population with diabetes is highly heterogeneous, it is of major interest to determine the risk factors of progression to a more serious life-threatening COVID-19 infection. This brief review discusses the main findings of CORONADO, a prospective observational study in France that specifically addressed this issue as well as related observations from other countries, mainly China and the US. Some prognostic factors beyond old age have been identified: for example, an increased body mass index is a major risk factor for requiring respiratory assistance. Indeed, obesity combines several risk factors, including impaired respiratory mechanics, the presence of other comorbidities and inappropriate inflammatory responses, partly due to ectopic fat deposits. While previous diabetic microvascular (renal) and macrovascular complications also increase risk of death, the quality of past glucose control had no independent influence on hospitalized diabetes patient outcomes, but whether the quality of glucose control might modulate risk of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized diabetes patients is still unknown. In addition, no negative signs regarding the use of RAAS blockers and DPP-4 inhibitors and outcomes of COVID-19 could be identified. Hyperglycaemia at the time of hospital admission is associated with poor outcomes, but it may simply be considered a marker of severity of the infection. Thus, the impact of glucose control during hospitalization on outcomes related to COVID-19, which was not investigated in the CORONADO study, is certainly deserving of specific investigation.

AB  - Summary
Hospital-onset COVID-19 infections (HOCIs) are associated with excess morbidity and mortality in patients and healthcare workers. The aim of this review was to explore and describe the current literature in HOCI surveillance. Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and MedRxiv were searched up to 30 November 2020 using broad search criteria. Articles of HOCI surveillance systems were included. Data describing HOCI definitions, HOCI incidence, types of HOCI identification surveillance systems, and level of system implementation were extracted. A total of 292 citations were identified. Nine studies on HOCI surveillance were included. Six studies reported on the proportion of HOCI among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which ranged from 0 to 15.2%. Six studies provided HOCI case definitions. Standardized national definitions provided by the UK and US governments were identified. Four studies included healthcare workers in the surveillance. One study articulated a multimodal strategy of infection prevention and control practices including HOCI surveillance. All identified HOCI surveillance systems were implemented at institutional level, with eight studies focusing on all hospital inpatients and one study focusing on patients in the emergency department. Multiple types of surveillance were identified. Four studies reported automated surveillance, of which one included real-time analysis, and one included genomic data. Overall, the study quality was limited by the observational nature with short follow-up periods. In conclusion, HOCI case definitions and surveillance methods were developed pragmatically. Whilst standardized case definitions and surveillance systems are ideal for integration with existing routine surveillance activities and adoption in different settings, we acknowledged the difficulties in establishing such standards in the short-term.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by a newly emerged coronavirus (CoV) called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) comorbidities have significantly increased morbidity and mortality. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers (ARBs) improve CVD outcomes; however, there is concern that they may worsen the prognosis of CVD patients that become infected with SARS-CoV-2 because the virus uses the ACE2 receptor to bind to and subsequently infect host cells. Thus, some health care providers and media sources have questioned the continued use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. In this brief review, we discuss the effect of ACE inhibitor-induced bradykinin on the cardiovascular system, on the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) regulation in COVID-19 patients, and analyze recent clinical studies regarding patients treated with RAAS inhibitors. We propose that the application of RAAS inhibitors for COVID-19 patients with CVDs may be beneficial rather than harmful.

AB  - Background
Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors could alter mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but existing meta-analyses that combined crude and adjusted results may be confounded by the fact that comorbidities are more common in ARB/ACE inhibitor users.
Methods
We searched PubMed/MEDLINE/Embase for cohort studies and meta-analyses reporting mortality by preexisting ARB/ACE inhibitor treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Random effects meta-regression was used to compute pooled odds ratios for mortality adjusted for imbalance in age, sex, and prevalence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease between users and nonusers of ARBs/ACE inhibitors at the study level during data synthesis.
Results
In 30 included studies of 17,281 patients, 22%, 68%, 25%, and 11% had cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. ARB/ACE inhibitor use was associated with significantly lower mortality after controlling for potential confounding factors (odds ratio 0.77 [95% confidence interval: 0.62, 0.96]). In contrast, meta-analysis of ARB/ACE inhibitor use was not significantly associated with mortality when all studies were combined with no adjustment made for confounders (0.87 [95% confidence interval: 0.71, 1.08]).
Conclusions
ARB/ACE inhibitor use was associated with decreased mortality in cohorts of COVID-19 patients after adjusting for age, sex, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Unadjusted meta-analyses may not be appropriate for determining whether ARBs/ACE inhibitors are associated with mortality from COVID-19 because of indication bias.
Résumé
Introduction
Les antagonistes des récepteurs de l'angiotensine (ARA) et/ou les inhibiteurs de l'enzyme de conversion de l'angiotensine (IECA) feraient varier la mortalité liée à la COVID-19, mais il est possible que les méta-analyses actuelles qui combinaient les résultats bruts et ajustés soient invalidées du fait que les comorbidités sont plus fréquentes chez les utilisateurs d'ARA/IECA.
Méthodes
Nous avons effectué des recherches dans les bases de données PubMed/MEDLINE/Embase pour trouver des études de cohorte et des méta-analyses qui portent sur la mortalité associée à un traitement préexistant par ARA/IECA chez les patients hospitalisés atteints de la COVID-19. Nous avons utilisé la métarégression à effets aléatoires pour calculer les rapports de cotes regroupés de mortalité ajustés en fonction du déséquilibre de l’âge, du sexe, et de la prévalence des maladies cardiovasculaires, de l'hypertension, du diabète sucré et de l'insuffisance rénale chronique entre les utilisateurs et les non-utilisateurs d'ARA/IECA dans le cadre de l’étude durant la synthèse des données.
Résultats
Dans les 30 études portant sur 17 281 patients, 22 %, 68 %, 25 % et 11 % avaient respectivement une maladie cardiovasculaire, de l'hypertension, le diabète sucré et de l'insuffisance rénale chronique. L'utilisation des ARA/IECA a été associée à une mortalité significativement plus faible après avoir tenu compte des facteurs confusionnels potentiels (rapport de cotes 0,77 [intervalle de confiance à 95 % : 0,62, 0,96]). En revanche, la méta-analyse sur l'utilisation des ARA/IECA n'a pas été associée de façon significative à la mortalité lorsque toutes les études ont été combinées sans ajustement sur les facteurs confusionnels (0,87 [intervalle de confiance à 95 % : 0,71, 1,08]).
Conclusions
L'utilisation des ARA/IECA a été associée à la diminution de la mortalité au sein des cohortes de patients atteints de la COVID-19 après l'ajustement en fonction de l’âge, du sexe, des maladies cardiovasculaires, de l'hypertension, du diabète et de l'insuffisance rénale chronique. Les méta-analyses non ajustées peuvent ne pas permettre de déterminer si les ARA/IECA sont associés à la mortalité liée à la COVID-19 en raison du biais d'indication.

AB  - Objectives
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the extreme vulnerability of older people and other individuals who reside in long-term care, creating an urgent need for evidence-based policy that can adequately protect these community members. This study aimed to provide synthesized evidence to support policy decision making.
Design
Rapid narrative review investigating strategies that have prevented or mitigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission in long-term care.
Setting and Participants
Residents and staff in care settings such as nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
Methods
PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were systematically searched, with studies describing potentially effective strategies included. Studies were excluded if they did not report empirical evidence (eg, commentaries and consensus guidelines). Study quality was appraised on the basis of study design; data were extracted from published reports and synthesized narratively using tabulated data extracts and summary tables.
Results
Searches yielded 713 articles; 80 papers describing 77 studies were included. Most studies were observational, with no randomized controlled trials identified. Intervention studies provided strong support for widespread surveillance, early identification and response, and rigorous infection prevention and control measures. Symptom- or temperature-based screening and single point-prevalence testing were found to be ineffective, and serial universal testing of residents and staff was considered crucial. Attention to ventilation and environmental management, digital health applications, and acute sector support were also considered beneficial although evidence for effectiveness was lacking. In observational studies, staff represented substantial transmission risk and workforce management strategies were important components of pandemic response. Higher-performing facilities with less crowding and higher nurse staffing ratios had reduced transmission rates. Outbreak investigations suggested that facility-level leadership, intersectoral collaboration, and policy that facilitated access to critical resources were all significant enablers of success.
Conclusions and Implications
High-quality evidence of effectiveness in protecting LTCFs from COVID-19 was limited at the time of this study, though it continues to emerge. Despite widespread COVID-19 vaccination programs in many countries, continuing prevention and mitigation measures may be required to protect vulnerable long-term care residents from COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. This rapid review summarizes current evidence regarding strategies that may be effective.

As on 3rd June 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has affected 171049741 people worldwide with 3549710 deaths. Nanomedicine such as nanoparticles, liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, virus-like nanoparticles offer tremendous hopes to treat viral infections including COVID-19. Most importantly target specific ligands can be attached on the surface of them and this makes them more target specific and the loaded drug can be delivered to cellular and molecular level. These properties of nanomedicines can be utilized to deliver drugs or vaccines to treat viral diseases including SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review discusses about SARS-CoV-2 and the potential application of nanomedicines for delivering biological macromolecules like vaccines and drugs for treating COVID-19.

AB  - Introduction
Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a world-wide pandemic with an enormous medical and societal-economic toll. Thus, our aim was to gather all available information regarding comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, outcomes, laboratory findings, imaging features, and treatments in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Methods
EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies published in any language between December 1st, 2019 and March 28th, 2020. Original studies were included if the exposure of interest was an infection with SARS-CoV-2 or confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcome was the risk ratio of comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, imaging features, treatments, outcomes, and complications associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. We performed random-effects pairwise meta-analyses for proportions and relative risks, I2, T2, and Cochrane Q, sensitivity analyses, and assessed publication bias.
Results
148 studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review and meta-analysis with 12′149 patients (5′739 female) and a median age of 47.0 [35.0–64.6] years. 617 patients died from COVID-19 and its complication. 297 patients were reported as asymptomatic. Older age (SMD: 1.25 [0.78–1.72]; p < 0.001), being male (RR = 1.32 [1.13–1.54], p = 0.005) and pre-existing comorbidity (RR = 1.69 [1.48–1.94]; p < 0.001) were identified as risk factors of in-hospital mortality. The heterogeneity between studies varied substantially (I2; range: 1.5–98.2%). Publication bias was only found in eight studies (Egger's test: p < 0.05).
Conclusions
Our meta-analyses revealed important risk factors that are associated with severity and mortality of COVID-19.

AB  - While the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps the world, much evidence is being gathered regarding its novel pathological mechanisms. It is the authors’ clinical experience that patients in the intensive care unit suffering from COVID-19 are extremely pro-coagulable, with venous and arterial thromboembolism frequently observed, and losses of vascular access lines and filtration circuits to thrombosis now commonplace. Here, we explore the evidence for hypercoagulability in this group, presenting evidence of both a localised pulmonary hypercoagulability, and a systemic hypercoagulability resulting in thrombosis distant to the pulmonary vasculature. Furthermore, we discuss the possible risk factors exacerbated by, or selected for in COVID-19. We review the available evidence for use of plasma D-dimer as a prognostic marker, exploring the possibility that it acts as a marker of a COVID-19-associated hypercoagulability. We review the evidence for a pro-coagulant subtype of disseminated intravascular coagulation, discussing its clinical significance. Finally, we discuss the current evidence surrounding treatment of COVID-19 hypercoagulability, including prophylactic and treatment-dose heparin, thrombolytic agents, antiplatelet agents, and direct thrombin inhibitors, among others. We suggest areas in which further investigation is urgently needed to reduce the startling incidence of thrombosis in this group, a complication no doubt contributing to morbidity and mortality.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has turned out to be a pandemic in short period of time due to the high transmissibility of its causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Various reports have suggested the promising link between overexpression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and COVID-19 pathogenesis. The severity of COVID-19 pathophysiology is greatly depended on several comorbidities, like hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), respiratory and cardiovascular disease, out of which DM has emerged as a major risk factor. The current review focuses on the link among the expression of ACE2, use of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), and risk of COVID-19 pathogenesis in DM. The review also emphasizes on synergistic detrimental effect of DM and COVID-19 on the immune system in provoking uncontrolled cytokine storm which eventually leads to lethal consequences. Finally, several possible therapeutic strategies have been highlighted to reduce the excess of risk associated with COVID-19 in people with DM.

AB  - Cardiovascular wellbeing has been dramatically affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the reason for the coronavirus disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. There is a greater risk of morbidity and death in individuals with preexisting heart diseases. Clinical syndromes of the acute coronary syndrome, acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, heart failure, and venous thromboembolism can, directly and indirectly, affect the heart. There may also be adverse heart effects of specific therapeutics under review for COVID-19. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) mechanism in virus replication makes it essential to understand the consequences of the system-modulating medications. For optimum patient care, detailed knowledge of specific cardiovascular symptoms of COVID-19 and the role of RAAS in the prognosis of COVID-19 disease is necessary.

AB  - Background
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) accounts for a substantial proportion of sudden cardiac events globally, with hundreds of thousands of cases reported annually in the United States. The mortality rate of patients who suffer OHCA remains high despite extensive utilization of resources.
Objectives
We aim to describe the current landscape of OHCA during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide an overview of the logistical challenges and resuscitation protocols amongst emergency medical service (EMS) personnel.
Discussion
Recent studies in Italy, New York City, and France characterized a significant increase in OHCA incidence in conjunction with the arrival of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The presence of the pandemic challenged existing protocols for field resuscitation of cardiac arrest patients as the pandemic necessitated prioritization of EMS personnel and other healthcare providers' safety through stringent personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements. Studies also characterized difficulties encountered by the first responder system during COVID-19, such as dispatcher overload, increased response times, and adherence to PPE requirements, superimposed on PPE shortages. The lack of guidance by governmental agencies and specialty organizations to provide unified safety protocols for resuscitation led to the development of different resuscitative protocols globally.
Conclusions
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic modified the approach of first responders to OHCA. With the rise in OCHA during the pandemic in several geographic regions and the risks of disease transmission with superimposed equipment shortages, novel noninvasive, adjunct tools, such as point of care ultrasound, warrant consideration. Further prehospital studies should be considered to optimize OHCA and resource management while minimizing risk to personnel.

AB  - ABSTRACT
The outbreak of the pandemic associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led researchers to find new potential treatments, including nonpharmacological molecules such as zinc (Zn2+). Specifically, the use of Zn2+ as a therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on several findings: 1) the possible role of the anti-inflammatory activity of Zn2+ on the aberrant inflammatory response triggered by COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19), 2) properties of Zn2+ in modulating the competitive balance between the host and the invading pathogens, and 3) the antiviral activity of Zn2+ on a number of pathogens, including coronaviruses. Furthermore, Zn2+ has been found to play a central role in regulating brain functioning and many disorders have been associated with Zn2+ deficiency, including neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, and brain injuries. Within this context, we carried out a narrative review to provide an overview of the evidence relating to the effects of Zn2+ on the immune and nervous systems, and the therapeutic use of such micronutrients in both neurological and infective disorders, with the final goal of elucidating the possible use of Zn2+ as a preventive or therapeutic intervention in COVID-19. Overall, the results from the available evidence showed that, owing to its neuroprotective properties, Zn2+ supplementation could be effective not only on COVID‐19–related symptoms but also on virus replication, as well as on COVID-19–related inflammation and neurological damage. However, further clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of Zn2+ as a nonpharmacological treatment of COVID-19 are required to achieve an overall improvement in outcome and prognosis.

AB  - Obesity is a major health problem whose well-known association with psoriasis has been amply described. The importance of obesity as a risk factor for poor prognosis in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has recently been demonstrated. This review examines a possible relationship between obesity, psoriasis, and COVID-19, analyzing the pathophysiological links and their practical implications. On the one hand, a higher body mass index increases the risk of psoriasis and is also a factor in metabolic syndrome, which is common in patients with psoriasis and has been implicated in reducing the effectiveness of psoriasis treatments. On the other hand, obesity is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 and mortality. Obesity also promotes a proinflammatory state in the lung, where it compromises respiratory mechanics.
Resumen
La obesidad es un importante problema sanitario y su asociación a la psoriasis es bien conocida y ha sido ampliamente descrita. Recientemente, su relevancia en relación con la COVID-19, enfermedad causada por el betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, se ha puesto de manifiesto al demostrarse que es un factor de mal pronóstico para estos pacientes. En este trabajo se analiza la relación que puede existir entre obesidad, psoriasis y COVID-19, analizando los nexos fisiopatológicos comunes entre estas entidades y las implicaciones prácticas de esta asociación. Por un lado, el aumento del índice de masa corporal aumenta el riesgo de padecer psoriasis y, además, la obesidad es un factor implicado tanto en el síndrome metabólico, que también está incrementado en pacientes con psoriasis, como en una menor eficacia de los tratamientos. Por otro lado, la obesidad es un factor de riesgo para gravedad de la COVID-19 y para su mortalidad. Además, a nivel pulmonar promueve un estado proinflamatorio y tiene un efecto mecánico desfavorable.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly across the world. The vast majority of patients with COVID-19 manifest mild to moderate symptoms but may progress to severe cases or even mortalities. Young adults of reproductive age are the most affected population by SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is no consensus yet if pregnancy contributes to the severity of COVID-19. Initial studies of pregnant women have found that COVID-19 significantly increases the risk of preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and low birth weight, which have been associated with non-communicable diseases in offspring. Besides, maternal viral infections with or without vertical transmission have been allied with neurological and behavioral disorders of the offspring. In this review, obstetrical outcomes of women with COVID-19 and possible risks for their offspring are discussed by reviewing maternal immune responses to COVID-19 based on the current evidence. Structural and systemic follow-up of offspring who are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in-utero is suggested.

AB  - Aims
We aimed to briefly review the general characteristics of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and provide a better understanding of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in people with diabetes, and its management.
Methods
We searched for articles in PubMed and Google Scholar databases till 02 April 2020, with the following keywords: “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “infection”, “pathogenesis”, “incubation period”, “transmission”, “clinical features”, “diagnosis”, “treatment”, “diabetes”, with interposition of the Boolean operator “AND”.
Results
The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death. Older age, diabetes and other comorbidities are reported as significant predictors of morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation, increased coagulation activity, immune response impairment, and potential direct pancreatic damage by SARS-CoV-2 might be among the underlying mechanisms of the association between diabetes and COVID-19. No conclusive evidence exists to support the discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers or thiazolidinediones because of COVID-19 in people with diabetes. Caution should be taken to potential hypoglycemic events with the use of chloroquine in these subjects. Patient tailored therapeutic strategies, rigorous glucose monitoring and careful consideration of drug interactions might reduce adverse outcomes.
Conclusions
Suggestions are made on the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19, and its management. No definite conclusions can be made based on current limited evidence. Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted.

AB  - Objectives
The COVID-19 pandemic put into question the organizational skills of LTCF. The containment measures implemented in several Asian countries avoided heavy death tolls in LTCF in contrast to other countries across the globe. The aim of this review is therefore to investigate and illustrate the measures that were undertaken in Asia to contain and prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in LTCF.
Design
Narrative review.
Setting and Participants
Asian older subjects institutionalized in LTCF.
Methods
Broad literature research from July 2020–April 2021. The following search terms were used: “COVID-19 Nursing homes” AND the country of interest or “contact tracing.” Eligible categories for inclusion comprise editorials, reviews, government guidelines, letters to the editor, and perspectives. The COVID-19 measures were then subdivided into different sections and compiled into an evidence table.
Results
Prompt measures were put into action since the beginning of the pandemic that avoided the spread of COVID-19 in LTCF. Examples range from simple acts of proper hand hygiene and environmental disinfection, swab testing, social distancing, preventive measures on health care workers, organizational measures such as quarantine, outbreak control, visitor restrictions, relationship with acute hospitals, and admission policy. Technology also played a fundamental role in promoting social distancing by using specific robots and in managing contact tracing.
Conclusions and Implications
The Asian preventive control guidelines are similar to those recommended elsewhere. Difference in timing and past experience with prior outbreaks such as SARS and MERS might have favored the Asian response. Furthermore, sociocultural values toward older persons by protecting and making sure that LTCF are part of the health care system could have also played a role.

AB  - Pregnant women and neonates are often categorised as being at high risk during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the characteristics of COVID-19 disease in pregnant women and non-pregnant women are very similar. However, pregnant women with COVID-19 in the third trimester are more likely than their non-pregnant counterparts to require intensive care, though this may reflect a lower threshold for intervention in pregnant women rather than more serious disease. Compared with pregnant women without COVID-19, pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital have worse maternal outcomes, including death, although the absolute risk remains very low. Outcomes of neonates born to women positive for COVID-19 are generally very good, though iatrogenic preterm birth is more common. Findings from these studies highlight the need for further monitoring of the outcomes of pregnant and post-partum women according to trimester during this pandemic.

AB  - Background
Breast Cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic affected healthcare delivery throughout North America. Breast cancer diagnosis and management was similarly affected.
Methods
We conducted a scoping review to determine the impact of COVID-19 on BC care and the impact on patients’ well-being.
Results
Our review found that the pandemic led to changes in screenings, biopsies, medical therapy, and surgery. Constraints of the pandemic left patients without resources to navigate the emotional toll from social distancing. There was a disparity in patients’ perceptions of the impact of the pandemic on BC care.
Conclusion
Although the pandemic altered medical care in general, we found that the impact on breast cancer care was counterintuitively not as significant as predicted. However, the pandemic did impact breast cancer patients’ mental well-being. This highlights the importance of properly communicating, in real-time, guidelines on breast cancer management to allay the fears of the general public.

AB  - ABSTRACT
During the first year of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, many drugs and drug candidates have been evaluated as treatment options. None yet has proved to be an effective cure, but progress in controlling the disease has been made. In June 2020 we published an article that described the mechanistic rationale behind the repurposing of seven licensed drugs in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 and reviewed synthetic routes to these drugs. Several developments have occurred since then. Remdesivir (trade name Veklury) has been approved for use in the U.S. and Europe. Dexamethasone, a steroid drug first approved in 1959, has shown mortality reduction in severe COVID patients. Molnupiravir, a new and promising oral antiviral drug, is being studied in late-stage clinical trials. In this review, we update synthetic work that has been recently published on remdesivir, provide an overview of several routes to molnupiravir, and review classical routes to dexamethasone as well as some of those more recently developed.

AB  - Summary
The significant morbidity and mortality of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) prompted a global race to develop new therapies. These include interventions using cell- or cell-derived products, several of which are being tested in well-designed, properly controlled clinical trials. Yet, the search for cell-based COVID-19 treatments has also been fraught with hyperbolic claims; flouting of crucial regulatory, scientific, and ethical norms; and distorted communication of research findings. In this paper, we critically examine ethical issues and public communication challenges related to the development of cell-based therapeutics for COVID-19. Drawing on the lessons learned from this ongoing process, we argue against the rushed development of cell-based interventions. We conclude by outlining ways to improve the ethical conduct of cell-based clinical investigations and public communication of therapeutic claims.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first reported in Wuhan, China, has rapidly spread worldwide. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used to prevent and treat viral epidemics and plagues for over 2,500 years. In the guidelines on fighting against COVID-19, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China has recommended certain TCM formulas, namely Jinhua Qinggan granule (JHQGG), Lianhua Qingwen granule (LHQWG), Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPDD), Xuanfei Baidu granule (XFBD), Xuebijing injection (XBJ), and Huashi Baidu granule (HSBD) for treating COVID-19 infected individuals. Among these six TCM formulas, JHQGG and LHQWG effectively treated mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 infections. XFBD therapy is recommended for mild COVID-19 infections, while XBJ and HSBD effectively treat severe COVID-19 infections. The internationalization of TCM faces many challenges due to the absence of a clinical efficacy evaluation system, insufficient research evidence, and a lack of customer trust across the globe. Therefore, evidence-based research is crucial in battling this infectious disease. This review summarizes SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the history of TCM used to treat various viral epidemics, with a focus on six TCM formulas. Based on the evidence, we also discuss the composition of various TCM formulas, their underlying therapeutic mechanisms, and their role in curing COVID-19 infections. In addition, we evaluated the roles of six TCM formulas in the treatment and prevention of other influenza diseases, such as influenza A (H1N1), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Furthermore, we highlighted the efficacy and side effects of single prescriptions used in TCM formulas.

AB  - Patients with inflammatory arthritis represent a possible high-risk group to COVID-19 due to their immunosuppressive regimen designed to maintain low disease activity. Thus, substantial effort has been put forth to understand the impact of COVID-19 on these patients. Patients with rheumatic diseases as a whole do not appear to be more susceptible to acquiring COVID-19. Furthermore, immunosuppression generally did not increase the likelihood of developing severe COVID-19, with the important exception of medium and high-dose glucocorticoid use. In addition, a small number of COVID-19 patients have developed new inflammatory arthritis; whether this represents an unmasking of previous subclinical disease or a bone fide virus-induced arthritis is unclear. Nevertheless, it appears that inflammatory arthritis patients currently on immunosuppression should continue their medication to prevent future flares and limit glucocorticoid usage. While this continues to be a rapidly evolving field, these data are reassuring to both patients with and providers treating inflammatory arthritides.

AB  - The post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) is characterized by the persistence of fluctuating symptoms over three months from the onset of the possible or confirmed COVID-19 acute phase. Current data suggests that at least 10% of people with previously documented infection may develop PACS, and up to 50–80% of prevalence is reported among survivors after hospital discharge. This viewpoint will discuss various aspects of PACS, particularly in older adults, with a specific hypothesis to describe PACS as the expression of a modified aging trajectory induced by SARS CoV-2. This hypothesis will be argued from biological, clinical and public health view, addressing three main questions: (i) does SARS-CoV-2-induced alterations in aging trajectories play a role in PACS?; (ii) do people with PACS face immuno-metabolic derangements that lead to increased susceptibility to age-related diseases?; (iii) is it possible to restore the healthy aging trajectory followed by the individual before pre-COVID?. A particular focus will be given to the well-being of people with PACS that could be assessed by the intrinsic capacity model and support the definition of the healthy aging trajectory.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded pathologists of our significant roles in the management and understanding of rapidly spreading and dangerous pathogens, from identifying the agent to characterizing the clinical pathology to managing the dead. Cellular pathology – through autopsy - has depicted the main features: viral pneumonitis, acute lung injury, organising pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, thrombophilia and infarction, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome with multi-organ failure. These are similar to another viral pandemic of the 20th century, H1N1 influenza; but contrast with the second major more complicated pandemic, that of HIV/AIDS. The outcomes of these infections are compared, along with seasonal influenza and SARS-1-CoV disease. Work to be done on COVID-19 includes characterisation of the emerging ‘long COVID’ syndrome, and monitoring the complications of therapies and vaccination programs.

AB  - Summary
Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) across the Pacific region have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and emergency care (EC) clinicians have been on the frontline of response efforts. Their responsibilities have extended from triage and clinical management of patients with COVID-19 to health system leadership and coordination. This has exposed EC clinicians to a range of ethical and operational challenges. This paper describes the context and methodology of a rapid, collaborative, qualitative research project that explored the experiences of EC clinicians in Pacific LMICs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted in three phases, with data obtained from online regional EC support forums, key informant interviews and focus group discussions. A phenomenological approach was adopted, incorporating a hybrid inductive and deductive thematic analysis. Research findings, reported in other manuscripts in this collection, will inform multi-sectoral efforts to improve health system preparedness for future public health emergencies.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 virus, the main culprit for COVID-19 disaster, has triggered a gust of curiosity both in the mechanism of action of this infection as well as potential risk factors for disease generation and regimentation. The prime focus of the present review, which is basically a narrative one, is in utilizing the current concepts of vitamin D3 as an agent with myriad functions, one of them being immunocompetence and a promising weapon for both innate and adaptive immunity against COVID-19 infection. Some of the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 virus such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) overlap with the pathophysiological effects that are overcome due to already established role of vitamin D3 e.g., amelioration of cytokine outburst. Additionally, the cardiovascular complications due to COVID-19 infection may also be connected to vitamin D3 levels and the activity of its active forms. Eventually, we summarise the clinical, observational and epidemiological data of the respiratory diseases including COVID-19 disease and try to bring its association with the potential role of vitamin D3, in particular, the activity of its active forms, circulating levels and its supplementation, against dissemination of this disease.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has taken the world by surprise into a major crisis of overwhelming morbidity and mortality. This highly infectious disease is associated with respiratory failure unusual in other coronavirus infections. Mounting evidence link the accelerated progression of the disease in COVID-19 patients to the hyper-inflammatory state termed as the “cytokine storm” involving major systemic perturbations. These include iron dysregulation manifested as hyperferritinemia associated with disease severity. Iron dysregulation induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and promotes oxidative stress. The mitochondria are the hub of cellular oxidative homeostasis. In addition, the mitochondria may circulate “cell-free” in non-nucleated platelets, in extracellular vesicles and mitochondrial DNA is found in the extracellular space. The heightened inflammatory/oxidative state may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction leading to platelet damage and apoptosis. The interaction of dysfunctional platelets with coagulation cascades aggravates clotting events and thrombus formation. Furthermore, mitochondrial oxidative stress may contribute to microbiota dysbiosis, altering coagulation pathways and fueling the inflammatory/oxidative response leading to the vicious cycle of events. Here, we discuss various cellular and systemic incidents caused by SARS-CoV-2 that may critically impact intra and extracellular mitochondrial function, and contribute to the progression and severity of the disease. It is crucial to understand how these key modulators impact COVID-19 pathogenesis in the quest to identify novel therapeutic targets that may reduce fatal outcomes of the disease.

AB  - We failed to adequately launch a gender transformative response to COVID-19 pandemic, data by sex on a variety of indicators for most countries are hard to find. Some symptoms reported as common of COVID-19 infection, are more prominent in men, while others are more prominent in women, one cannot with certainty exclude that some of the differences observed could be due to gender bias in the management of cases in health services. The gender implications of the pandemic reach wide and far. Inequalities can be further aggravated as sex and gender intersect with other axes of inequality. The SAGER guidelines exemplify an effort to improve reporting of sex and gender dimensions and encouraging researchers to integrate these aspects in the research design. these observations and emerging evidence about the persistent gender-blind approach to COVID-19 is a wake-up call to change course. National Gender Equality Institutions can be central in ensuring gender matters are considered in government responses. COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity to reverse the trend and take action to apply an intersectional feminist approach to global health that enables a just and equal world where everyone's health and wellbeing matter.
Resumen
No se ha conseguido dar una respuesta adecuadamente transformadora desde la perspectiva de género a la pandemia de la COVID-19. Los datos por sexo en una variedad de indicadores para la mayoría de los países son difíciles de encontrar. Algunos síntomas comunes de la infección por COVID-19, son más frecuentes en los hombres, mientras que otros lo son en las mujeres, no pudiendo excluir con certeza que algunas de las diferencias observadas se deban a un sesgo de género en el manejo de los casos en los servicios de salud. Las implicaciones de género de la pandemia son amplias y de gran alcance. Las desigualdades pueden agravarse aún más cuando el sexo y el género se cruzan con otros ejes de desigualdad. Las directrices del SAGER ejemplifican un esfuerzo por mejorar la información sobre las dimensiones de sexo y género y por animar a quienes investigan a integrar estos aspectos en el diseño de la investigación. Estas observaciones y las pruebas emergentes sobre el persistente enfoque ciego al género de la COVID-19 son una llamada de atención para cambiar de rumbo. Las instituciones nacionales de igualdad de género pueden ser fundamentales para garantizar que las cuestiones de género se consideren en las respuestas gubernamentales. La pandemia de la COVID-19 es una oportunidad para invertir la tendencia y tomar medidas para aplicar un enfoque feminista interseccional en la salud global que permita un mundo justo e igualitario donde la salud y el bienestar de todos y todas importen.

AB  - Background
COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with significant morbidity and high levels of mortality. This paper describes the processes involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 from the initial infection and subsequent destruction of type II alveolar epithelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 and culminating in the development of ARDS.
Main body
The activation of alveolar cells and alveolar macrophages leads to the release of large quantities of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and their translocation into the pulmonary vasculature. The presence of these inflammatory mediators in the vascular compartment leads to the activation of vascular endothelial cells platelets and neutrophils and the subsequent formation of platelet neutrophil complexes. These complexes in concert with activated endothelial cells interact to create a state of immunothrombosis. The consequence of immunothrombosis include hypercoagulation, accelerating inflammation, fibrin deposition, migration of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) producing neutrophils into the alveolar apace, activation of the NLRP3 inflammazome, increased alveolar macrophage destruction and massive tissue damage by pyroptosis and necroptosis Therapeutic combinations aimed at ameliorating immunothrombosis and preventing the development of severe COVID-19 are discussed in detail.

AB  - Endothelial injury and microvascular/macrovascular thrombosis are common pathophysiological features of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). However, the optimal thromboprophylactic regimens remain unknown across the spectrum of illness severity of COVID-19. A variety of antithrombotic agents, doses, and durations of therapy are being assessed in ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that focus on outpatients, hospitalized patients in medical wards, and patients critically ill with COVID-19. This paper provides a perspective of the ongoing or completed RCTs related to antithrombotic strategies used in COVID-19, the opportunities and challenges for the clinical trial enterprise, and areas of existing knowledge, as well as data gaps that may motivate the design of future RCTs.

AB  - Approximately 9 months of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavius-2 (SARS-CoV-2 [COVID-19]) spreading across the globe has led to widespread COVID-19 acute hospitalizations and death. The rapidity and highly communicable nature of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has hampered the design and execution of definitive randomized, controlled trials of therapy outside of the clinic or hospital. In the absence of clinical trial results, physicians must use what has been learned about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in determining early outpatient treatment of the illness with the aim of preventing hospitalization or death. This article outlines key pathophysiological principles that relate to the patient with early infection treated at home. Therapeutic approaches based on these principles include 1) reduction of reinoculation, 2) combination antiviral therapy, 3) immunomodulation, 4) antiplatelet/antithrombotic therapy, and 5) administration of oxygen, monitoring, and telemedicine. Future randomized trials testing the principles and agents discussed will undoubtedly refine and clarify their individual roles; however, we emphasize the immediate need for management guidance in the setting of widespread hospital resource consumption, morbidity, and mortality.

AB  - With more than 5 million fatalities and close to 300 million reported cases, COVID-19 is the first documented pandemic due to a coronavirus that continues to be a major health challenge. Despite being rapid, uncontrollable, and highly infectious in its spread, it also created incentives for technology development and redefined public health needs and research agendas to fast-track innovations to be translated. Breakthroughs in computational biology peaked during the pandemic with renewed attention to making all cutting-edge technology deliver agents to combat the disease. The demand to develop effective treatments yielded surprising collaborations from previously segregated fields of science and technology. The long-standing pharmaceutical industry's aversion to repurposing existing drugs due to a lack of exponential financial gain was overrun by the health crisis and pressures created by front-line researchers and providers. Effective vaccine development even at an unprecedented pace took more than a year to develop and commence trials. Now the emergence of variants and waning protections during the booster shots is resulting in breakthrough infections that continue to strain health care systems. As of now, every protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been structurally characterized and related host pathways have been extensively mapped out. The research community has addressed the druggability of a multitude of possible targets. This has been made possible due to existing technology for virtual computer-assisted drug development as well as new tools and technologies such as artificial intelligence to deliver new leads. Here in this article, we are discussing advances in the drug discovery field related to target-based drug discovery and exploring the implications of known target-specific agents on COVID-19 therapeutic management. The current scenario calls for more personalized medicine efforts and stratifying patient populations early on for their need for different combinations of prognosis-specific therapeutics. We intend to highlight target hotspots and their potential agents, with the ultimate goal of using rational design of new therapeutics to not only end this pandemic but also uncover a generalizable platform for use in future pandemics.

AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and the ensuing global pandemic, has resulted in an unprecedented response to identify therapies that can limit uncontrolled inflammation observed in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. The immune pathology behind COVID-19 is complex and involves the activation and interaction of multiple systems including, but not limited to, complement, inflammasomes, endothelial as well as innate and adaptive immune cells to bring about a convoluted profile of inflammation, coagulation and tissue damage. To date, therapeutic approaches have focussed on inhibition of coagulation, untargeted immune suppression and/or cytokine-directed blocking agents. Regardless of recently achieved improvements in individual patient outcomes and survival rates, improved and focussed approaches targeting individual systems involved is needed to further improve prognosis and wellbeing. This review summarizes the current understanding of molecular and cellular systems involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, and their contribution to pathogen clearance and damage to then discuss possible therapeutic options involving immunomodulatory drug delivery systems as well as summarising the complex interplay between them.

AB  - Background and aims
Corona virus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread rapidly. Growing evidences that overweight and obesity which extent nearly a third of the world population were associated with severe COVID-19. This study aimed to explore the association and risk of increased BMI and obesity with composite poor outcome in COVID-19 adult patients.
Methods
We conducted a systematic literature search from PubMed and Embase database. We included all original research articles in COVID-19 adult patients and obesity based on classification of Body Mass Index (BMI) and composite poor outcome which consist of ICU admission, ARDS, severe COVID-19, use of mechanical ventilation, hospital admission, and mortality.
Results
Sixteen studies were included in meta-analysis with 9 studies presented BMI as continuous outcome and 10 studies presented BMI as dichotomous outcome (cut-off ≥30 kg/m2). COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome had higher BMI with mean difference 1.12 (95% CI, 0.67–1.57, P < 0.001). Meanwhile, obesity was associated with composite poor outcome with odds ratio (OR) = 1.78 (95% CI, 1.25–2.54, P < 0.001) Multivariate meta-regression showed the association between BMI and obesity on composite poor outcome were affected by age, gender, DM type 2, and hypertension.
Conclusion
Obesity is a risk factor of composite poor outcome of COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome have higher BMI. BMI is an important routine procedure that should always be assessed in the management of COVID-19 patients and special attention should be given to patients with obesity.

AB  - Pandemic dynamics and health care responses are markedly different during the COVID-19 pandemic than in earlier outbreaks. Compared with established infectious disease such as influenza, we currently know relatively little about the origin, reservoir, cross-species transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Health care services, drug availability, laboratory testing, research capacity and global governance are more advanced than during 20th century pandemics, although COVID-19 has highlighted significant gaps. The risk of zoonotic transmission and an associated new pandemic is rising substantially. COVID-19 vaccine development has been done at unprecedented speed, with the usual sequential steps done in parallel. The pandemic has illustrated the feasibility of this approach and the benefits of a globally coordinated response and infrastructure. Some of the COVID-19 vaccines recently developed or currently in development might offer flexibility or sufficiently broad protection to swiftly respond to antigenic drift or emergence of new coronaviruses. Yet many challenges remain, including the large-scale production of sufficient quantity of vaccines, delivery of vaccines to all countries and ensuring vaccination of relevant age groups. This wide vaccine technology approach will be best employed in tandem with active surveillance for emerging variants or new pathogens using antigen mapping, metagenomics and next generation sequencing.

AB  - The world is currently facing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic which places great pressure on health care systems and workers, often presents with severe clinical features, and sometimes requires admission into intensive care units. Derangements in nutritional status, both for obesity and malnutrition, are relevant for the clinical outcome in acute illness. Systemic inflammation, immune system impairment, sarcopenia, and preexisting associated conditions, such as respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases related to obesity, could act as crucial factors linking nutritional status and the course and outcome of COVID-19. Nevertheless, vitamins and trace elements play an essential role in modulating immune response and inflammatory status. Overall, evaluation of the patient's nutritional status is not negligible for its implications on susceptibility, course, severity, and responsiveness to therapies, in order to perform a tailored nutritional intervention as an integral part of the treatment of patients with COVID-19. The aim of this study was to review the current data on the relevance of nutritional status, including trace elements and vitamin status, in influencing the course and outcome of the disease 3 mo after the World Health Organization's declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic.

AB  - The objective of this systematic review is to give a comprehensive interpretation of menstrual cycle changes after the COVID-19 vaccination. Additionally, it is imperative to assess reports of menstrual changes following vaccination to dispel concerns that COVID-19 vaccines hinder the likelihood of pregnancy in the long run. A literature review was conducted using digital databases to systematically identify the studies reporting any menstrual abnormalities after the COVID-19 vaccine. Detailed patient-level study characteristics including the type of study, sample size, administered vaccines, and menstrual abnormalities were abstracted. A total of 78 138 vaccinated females were included in this review from 14 studies. Of these, 39 759 (52.05%) had some form of a menstrual problem after vaccination. Due to the lack of published research articles, preprints were also included in this review. Menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and polymenorrhea were the most commonly observed problems and the overall study-level rate of menstrual abnormality ranged from 0.83% to 90.9%. Age, history of pregnancy, systemic side-effects of COVID-19, smoking, and second dose of COVID-19 vaccine were predictors of menstrual problems after vaccination.
Resumen
Alteraciones menstruales tras la vacunación contra la COVID-19: revisión sistemática Resumen El objetivo de esta revisión sistemática es aportar una interpretación amplia sobre los cambios de los ciclos menstruales tras la vacunación contra la COVID-19. Además, es imperativo evaluar los informes sobre los cambios menstruales tras la vacunación, para disipar preocupaciones en cuanto a que las vacunas contra la COVID-19 dificultan la probabilidad de embarazo a largo plazo. Se realizó una revisión de la literatura utilizando bases de datos digitales para identificar sistemáticamente los estudios que reportan cualquier alteración menstrual tras la vacuna contra la COVID-19. Se resumieron las características detalladas del estudio al nivel del paciente, incluyendo tipo de estudio, tamaño de la muestra, vacunas administradas, y alteraciones menstruales. Se incluyó en la revisión a un total de 78 138 mujeres vacunadas, procedentes de 14 estudios. De ellas, 39 759 (52,05%) tuvieron algún tipo de problema menstrual tras la vacunación. Debido a la falta de artículos de investigación publicados, también se incluyeron preimpresos en esta revisión. Menorragia, metrorragia, y polimenorrea fueron los problemas más comúnmente observados, oscilando la tasa global de alteraciones menstruales a nivel de estudios entre el 0,83 y el 90,9%. La edad, los antecedentes de embarazos, los efectos secundarios sistémicos de la COVID-19, el tabaquismo y la segunda dosis de la vacuna contra la COVID-19 fueron factores predictivos de problemas menstruales tras la vacunación.

AB  - Background and aims
Molnupiravir is a newer oral antiviral drug that has recently been tested in COVID-19. We aim to conduct a systematic review of literature to find out the efficacy and safety of molnupiravir in patients with COVID-19.
Methods
We systematically searched the electronic database of PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar from inception until October 15, 2021, using MeSH keywords. Ongoing trials of molnupiravir in COVID-19 were additionally searched from the ClinicalTrials.Gov and ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials. We retrieved all the available granular details of phase 1 to 3 studies of molnupiravir in COVID-19. Subsequently we reviewed the results narratively.
Results
Two phase 1 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled (DBRPC) studies of molnupiravir showed that 1600 mg daily dose is safe and tolerable, without any serious adverse events up to 5.5 days. One phase 2 DBPRC study found significantly lower time to clearance (RNA negativity) with molnupiravir 800 mg twice daily compared to the placebo (log-rank p value = 0.013) in mild to moderate COVID-19. Interim report of one phase 3 DBRPC study in non-hospitalized COVID-19 found a significant reduction in the risk of hospital admission or death by 50% (p = 0.0012). However, no significant benefit was observed with molnupiravir in the later stage of moderate to severe COVID-19.
Conclusion
Molnupiravir is first oral antiviral drug to demonstrate a significant benefit in reducing hospitalization or death in mild COVID-19 and could be an important weapon in the battle against SARS-CoV-2. However, its role in moderate to severe COVID-19 is questionable and more studies are needed.

AB  - Obesity is a chronic disease that leads to an increased risk of mortality and morbidity, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may create a new health challenge. There is clear evidence showing that some biological and social factors associated with obesity involve an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and greater severity compared to people with normal weight. Undoubtedly, obesity involves a low-grade proinflammatory state that produces a dysregulation of the immune system that compromises its ability to respond to respiratory infection by COVID-19 and so produces a worsening of the disease. In this review, the main epidemiological and pathophysiological data that associate obesity with COVID-19 are described.
Resumen
La obesidad es una enfermedad crónica asociada a incremento de la morbimortalidad en el mundo, y el impacto con la pandemia de COVID-19 puede suponer un nuevo reto sanitario. Disponemos de evidencias que sugieren que algunos factores biológicos y sociales asociados con la obesidad confieren un mayor riesgo de infección por COVID-19, de hospitalización y de mayor gravedad respecto a las personas con normopeso. Sin duda, la obesidad comporta un estado proinflamatorio de bajo grado que produce una desregulación del sistema inmune que compromete su capacidad de respuesta ante la infección respiratoria por la COVID-19 y propicia un empeoramiento de la enfermedad. En esta revisión se exponen los principales datos epidemiológicos y fisiopatológicos que asocian obesidad con la COVID-19.

AB  - ABSTRACT
This literature review discusses the current evidence on acute limb ischemia (ALI) in patients with COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, these patients have been at increased risk of arterial thrombotic events and subsequent mortality as a result of a hypercoagulable state. The exact mechanism of thrombosis is unknown; however arterial thrombosis may be due to invasion of endothelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, endothelial injury from inflammation, or even free-floating aortic thrombus. Multiple studies have been performed evaluating the medical and surgical management of these patients; the decision to proceed with operative intervention is dependent on the patient’s clinical status as it relates to COVID-19 and morbidity of that disease. The interventions afforded typically include anticoagulation in patients undergoing palliation; alternatively, thrombectomy (endovascular and open) is utilized in other patients. There is a high risk of rethrombosis, despite anticoagulation, given persistent endothelial injury from the virus. Postoperative mortality can be high in these patients.

AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial morbidity and mortality to humanity. Remarkable progress has been made in understanding both the innate and adaptive mechanisms involved in the host response to the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus, but much remains to be discovered. Robust upper airway defenses are critical in restricting SARS-CoV-2 replication and propagation. Further, the nasal abundance of viral uptake receptor, ACE2, and the host epithelial transcriptional landscape, are associated with differential disease outcomes across different patient cohorts. The adaptive host response to systemic COVID-19 is heterogeneous and complex. Blunted responses to interferon and robust cytokine generation are hallmarks of the disease, particularly at the advanced stages. Excessive immune cell influx into tissues can lead to substantial collateral damage to the host akin to sepsis. This review offers a contemporary summary of these mechanisms of disease and highlights potential avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic development. These include improved disease stratification, targeting effectors of immune-mediated tissue damage, and blunting of immune cell-mediated tissue damage.

AB  - While COVID-19 is best known as a respiratory infection, SARS-CoV-2 causes systemic disease manifestations including coagulopathies. Both dysregulated extracellular matrix remodeling pathways and circulating coagulation proteins are hallmarks of severe COVID-19 and often continue after the resolution of acute infection. Coagulation proteins have proven effective as biomarkers for severe disease and anticoagulants are a mainstay of COVID-19 therapeutics in hospitalized patients. While much knowledge has been gained about the role of clotting pathway activation in COVID-19, much remains to be elucidated in this complex network of signaling pathways.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) keeps on destroying normal social integrity worldwide, bringing about extraordinary medical services, cultural and financial interruption. Individuals with diabetes have been demonstrated to be at higher risk of complications and even death when exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Regardless of pandemic scale infection, there is presently limited comprehension on the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 on individuals with diabetes. Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant circulating plasma protein in human serum and attracted more interest from researchers because most susceptible to non-enzymatic glycation reactions. Albumin down-regulates the expression of ACE2 that is the target receptor of COVID-19. Hypoalbuminemia, coagulopathy, and vascular disease have been connected in COVID-19 and appear to predict outcomes independent of age and morbidity. This review discusses the most recent evidence that the ACE/ACE2 ratio could influence by human serum albumin both the susceptibility of individuals to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the outcome of the COVID-19 disease.

AB  - Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, has claimed more than 4.4 million lives worldwide (as of 20 August 2021). Severe cases of the disease often result in respiratory distress due to cytokine storm, and mechanical ventilation is required. Although, the lungs are the primary organs affected by the disease, more evidence on damage to the heart, kidney, and liver is emerging. A common link in these connections is the cardiovascular network. Inner lining of the blood vessels, called endothelium, is formed by a single layer of endothelial cells. Several clinical manifestations involving the endothelium have been reported, such as its activation via immunomodulation, endotheliitis, thrombosis, vasoconstriction, and distinct intussusceptive angiogenesis (IA), a unique and rapid process of blood-vessel formation by splitting a vessel into two lumens. In fact, the virus directly infects the endothelium via TMPRSS2 spike glycoprotein priming to facilitate ACE-2-mediated viral entry. Recent studies have indicated a significant increase in remodeling of the pulmonary vascular bed via intussusception in patients with COVID-19. However, the lack of circulatory biomarkers for IA limits its detection in COVID-19 pathogenesis. In this review, we describe the implications of angiogenesis in COVID-19, unique features of the pulmonary vascular bed and its remodeling, and a rapid and non-invasive assessment of IA to overcome the technical limitations in patients with COVID-19.

The assessment of the efficacy and safety of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in actual practice is extremely important, and monitoring efforts are being implemented worldwide. In Japan, a joint council in the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is held every two to three weeks to summarise information on the adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination, with careful assessment of individual case safety reports and comparison with background incidence rates. In 2021, the joint council mainly reviewed anaphylaxis, death, myocarditis/pericarditis, and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. These activities resulted in several safety-related regulatory actions, including the revision of vaccine package inserts with warnings about myocarditis/pericarditis. International sharing of vaccine safety information, as well as details of the evaluation systems, is important for international discussion and decision-making on better safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines.

The pathogenicity of the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows postulates that optimal status of essential nutrients is crucial in supporting both the early viraemic and later hyperinflammatory phases of COVID-19. Micronutrients such as vitamin C, D, zinc, and selenium play roles in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiviral, and immuno-modulatory functions and are useful in both innate and adaptive immunity. The purpose of this review is to provide a high-level summary of evidence on clinical outcomes associated with nutritional risk of these micronutrients observed in patients with COVID-19. A literature search was performed on PubMed and Google Scholar to obtain findings of cross-sectional and experimental studies in humans. The search resulted in a total of 1212 reports including all nutrients, but only 85 were included according to the eligibility criteria. Despite the diversity of studies and the lack of randomized clinical trials and prospective cohorts, there is evidence of the potential protective and therapeutic roles of vitamin C, D, zinc, and selenium in COVID-19. The findings summarized in this review will contribute to guide interventions in clinical practice or in future clinical studies.

AB  - Summary
The high prevalence of obesity and obesity-related comorbidities has reached pandemic proportions, particularly in Western countries. Obesity increases the risk to develop several chronic noncommunicable disease, ultimately contributing to reduced survival. Recently, obesity has been recognized as major risk factor for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)-related prognosis, contributing to worse outcomes in those with established COVID-19. Particularly, obesity has been associated with higher hospitalization rates in acute or intensive care and greater risk for invasive mechanical ventilation than lean people. Obesity is characterized by metabolic impairments and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation that causes a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, further aggravating the cytokine production and risk of cytokine storm response during Sars-Cov2 sepsis or other secondary infections. Moreover, the metabolic dysregulations are closely related to an impaired immune system and altered response to viral infection that can ultimately lead to a greater susceptibility to infections, longer viral shedding and greater duration of illness and severity of the disease. In individuals with obesity, maintaining a healthy diet, remaining physically active and reducing sedentary behaviors are particularly important during COVID-19-related quarantine to reduce metabolic and immune impairments. Moreover, such stategies are of utmost importance to reduce the risk for sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity, and to prevent a reduction and potentially even increase cardiorespiratory fitness, a well-known independent risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and recently found to be a risk factor also for hospitalizations secondary to COVID-19. Such lifestyle strategies may ultimately reduce morbility and mortality in patients with infectious disease, especially in those with concomitant obesity. The aim of this review is to discuss how obesity might increase the risk of COVID-19 and potentially affect its prognosis once COVID-19 is diagnosed. We therefore advocate for implementation of strategies aimed at preventing obesity in the first place, but also to minimize the metabolic anomalies that may lead to a compromized immune response and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, especially in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Background
Migrant populations in high-income countries have faced myriad health and social inequities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Migrants often work in frontline essential services that expose them to COVID-19. Migrant workers in meat processing plants have endured large COVID-19 outbreaks across multiple countries.
Objectives
We examine current scientific evidence around COVID-19 transmission, outcomes, and prevention for migrant workers and highlight meat processing plants as an example.
Sources
We performed a series of PubMed searches between January 1, 2020 and January 12, 2022.
Content
Migrant workers in high-income countries often work in occupations at high risk for COVID-19 transmission, contract COVID-19 at higher rates, and experience worse outcomes than native-born counterparts. For example, meat processing plants represent almost ideal environments for rapid and large-scale SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission; often, large migrant workforces confined to small workspaces perform physically demanding work in noisy environments that require shouting to communicate, increasing workers' respiratory rates and the quantity of aerosolized droplets expelled and thus increasing viral transmission risk. Although enhanced vaccination outreach programs remain an important equity approach for migrant worker safety, they alone are insufficient. The emergence and rapid spread of multiple increasingly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with variable vaccine escape properties, including Omicron in November 2021, highlight the importance of improved infection prevention and control strategies to protect migrant workers. Across countries, strategies such as improving ventilation and mask quality in many high-risk occupational settings are already required by employment law. Universal mandatory vaccination program should also be considered.
Implications
COVID-19 transmission prevention for migrant workers requires an aggressive multicomponent plan that includes (a) improved on-site ventilation and infection prevention and control strategies; (b) improved social supports such as paid sick leave; (c) mobile vaccination clinics and community engagement to overcome vaccine hesitancy and barriers; and (d) consideration of universal mandatory vaccination programs.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made significant impacts on global public health, including the development of several skin diseases that have arisen primarily as a result of the pandemic. Owing to the widespread expansion of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), the development of effective treatments for these skin diseases is drawing attention as an important social issue. For many centuries, ginseng and its major active ingredients, ginsenosides and saponins, have been widely regarded as herbal medicines. Further, the anti-viral action of ginseng suggests its potential effectiveness as a therapeutic agent against COVID-19. Thus, the aim of this review was to examine the association of skin lesions with COVID-19 and the effect of ginseng as a therapeutic agent to treat skin diseases induced by COVID-19 infection. We classified COVID-19-related skin disorders into three categories: caused by inflammatory, immune, and complex (both inflammatory and immune) responses and evaluated the evidence for ginseng as a treatment for each category. This review offers comprehensive evidence on the improvement of skin disorders induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection using ginseng and its active constituents.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is likely to remain endemic globally despite widespread vaccination. There is increasing concern for myocardial involvement and ensuing cardiac complications due to COVID-19, however, the available evidence suggests these risks are low. Pandemic publishing has resulted in rapid manuscript availability though pre-print servers. Subsequent article retractions, a lack of standardised definitions, over-reliance on isolated troponin elevation and the heterogeneity of studied patient groups (i.e. severe vs. symptomatic vs all infections) resulted in early concern for high rates of myocarditis in patients with and recovering from COVID-19. The estimated incidence of myocarditis in COVID-19 infection is 11 cases per 100,000 infections compared with an estimated 2.7 cases per 100,000 persons following mRNA vaccination. For substantiated cases, the clinical course of myocarditis related to COVID-19 or mRNA vaccination appears mild and self-limiting, with reports of severe/fulminant myocarditis being rare. There is limited data available on the management of myocarditis in these settings. Clinical guidance for appropriate use of cardiac investigations and monitoring in COVID-19 is needed for effective risk stratification and efficient use of cardiac resources in Australia. An amalgamation of national and international position statements and guidelines is helpful for guiding clinical practice. This paper reviews the current available evidence and guidelines and provides a summary of the risks and potential use of cardiac investigations and monitoring for patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently emerged pathogen that has caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the worst pandemic of our times leading to tremendous loss of human life and unprecedented measures of social distancing. COVID-19 symptom manifestations range from asymptomatic disease to severe and lethal outcomes. Lack of previous exposure and immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and high infectivity of the virus have contributed to its broad spread across the globe. In the absence of specific adaptive immunity, innate immune mechanisms are crucial for efficient antiviral defenses and control of the infection. Accumulating evidence now suggests that the remarkable heterogeneity in COVID-19 disease manifestations is due to variable degrees of impairment of innate immune mechanisms. In this review, we summarize recent findings describing both viral and host intrinsic factors that have been linked to defective innate immune responses and account for severe COVID-19. We also discuss emerging therapeutic opportunities for targeting innate immunity for the treatment of COVID-19.
