AB  - Background
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has produced substantial health challenges from the perspective of both its direct health complications and the disruption to delivery of standard care for individuals with a range of acute and chronic health issues. In parallel, the widespread application of social isolation initiatives in most countries raises the potential for significant mental health consequences and psychosocial impacts. This has major implications for cardiovascular health care professionals and the management of their patients.
Challenges
The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical isolation practices are likely to result in a range of mental health and psychosocial challenges. In addition to an increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress, the pandemic may also witness an increase in substance abuse, domestic violence and relationship discord. The consequences of these complications will be further magnified, when considering their potential effect on cardiovascular disease and its management.
Purpose
This commentary aims to summarise some of the potential mental health and psychosocial challenges that may arise in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - a novel coronavirus has rapid spread, and caused community infection around the globe. During the absence of a vaccine, people focused more on an immunity-boosting diet and needed clear knowledge about immunity-boosting foods. However, after the vaccination drive, the importance of food as a natural source of immunomodulation cannot be neglected. So, the purpose of this review was to describe the role of vital nutrient in boosting immune system of body apart from other factors like adequate sleep, exercise, and low stress levels. Macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, B-cells, and T-cells are the important components having important role in maintaining immunity of the human body. The first four-act as the initial mediators of innate host defense, and the latter two produce antibodies for pathogen destruction. The review investigated vital nutrients like vitamin-C, A, E and D, iron, zinc, folic acid, probiotics, and prebiotics affecting these immune components in some extent. Fruits, vegetables, spices, herbs, seeds, nuts, cereals, millets, and superfoods like chlorella and spirulina are good sources of these nutrients. However, fortified foods, functional foods, encapsulated foods with bioactive compounds and plant-based foods have shown immense potential in boosting immunity against viral infections like COVID-19. Some clinical trials and retrospective cohort studies have shown reduction in the severity of COVID-19 patients with relation to plant-based diet, vitamin D and C doses, probiotic, and zinc salts application.

AB  - How will the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic develop in the coming months and years? Based on an expert survey, we examine key aspects that are likely to influence the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. The challenges and developments will strongly depend on the progress of national and global vaccination programs, the emergence and spread of variants of concern (VOCs), and public responses to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). In the short term, many people remain unvaccinated, VOCs continue to emerge and spread, and mobility and population mixing are expected to increase. Therefore, lifting restrictions too much and too early risk another damaging wave. This challenge remains despite the reduced opportunities for transmission given vaccination progress and reduced indoor mixing in summer 2021. In autumn 2021, increased indoor activity might accelerate the spread again, whilst a necessary reintroduction of NPIs might be too slow. The incidence may strongly rise again, possibly filling intensive care units, if vaccination levels are not high enough. A moderate, adaptive level of NPIs will thus remain necessary. These epidemiological aspects combined with economic, social, and health-related consequences provide a more holistic perspective on the future of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The pandemic of childhood obesity that has been increasing over the last decade has collided with the current pandemic of COVID-19. Enforced behavioural changes have resulted in a myriad of problems for children particularly in weight management. Restricted activity is the most obvious but many other aspects of life have exacerbated biological, psychosocial, and behavioral factors identified as risks for childhood obesity. Significant effort is required to turn around the prevailing tide of weight gain necessitating changes in personal and family behavior and diet, as well as high-level governmental and educational policy. Evidence-based, focused, long-term interventions which are adequately funded are required. Enthusiasm and optimism for change coupled with public engagement by utilization of new technology as well as traditional methods offers hope for change. Public health interventions in isolation are inadequate and bolder changes to central policies and social structure are needed for sustained change. This will allow some mitigation of the affects of COVID-19 but also reduce negative outcomes in future comparable situations.

AB  - Viral diseases are emerging as global threats. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has severe global impacts. Safety, dosage, and potency of vaccines recently approved for emergency use against SARS-CoV-2 need further evaluation. There is still no effective treatment against COVID-19; therefore, safe, and effective vaccines or therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. Oil-in-water nanoemulsions (O/W NEs) are emerging as sophisticated, protective, and therapeutic platforms. Encapsulation capacity, which offers better drug pharmacokinetics, coupled with the tunable surfaces present NEs as promising tools for pharmaceutical applications. The challenges facing drug discovery, and the advancements of NEs in drug delivery demonstrate the potential of NEs against evolving diseases, like COVID-19. Here we summarize current COVID-19 knowledge and discuss the composition, stability, preparation, characterization, and biological fate of O/W NEs. We also provide insights into NE structural-functional properties that may contribute to therapeutic or preventative solutions against COVID-19.

AB  - The spread of COVID-19 led countries around the world to adopt lockdown measures of varying stringency, with the purpose of restricting the movement of people. However, the effectiveness of these measures on mobility has been markedly different. Employing a difference-in-differences design, we analyse the effectiveness of movement restrictions across different countries. We disentangle the role of regulation (stringency measures) from the role of people's knowledge about the spread of COVID-19. We proxy COVID-19 knowledge by using Google Trends data on the term “Covid”. We find that lockdown measures have a higher impact on mobility the more people learn about COVID-19. This finding is driven by countries with low levels of trust in institutions and low levels of education.

AB  - The purpose of the review was to investigate the changes in mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic review of qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods studies was conducted from February 2021 to March 2022 using four databases and five languages. 29 studies reporting on mental health services in 63 countries were included. Findings were organised according to nine major topics: (1) lack of preparedness vs. timely response and flexible solutions, (2) changes in access, referrals, and admission, (3) impacts on outpatient, community and psychosocial services, (4) inpatient: reorganisation of hospital psychiatric units/acute wards, (5) diagnostic and therapeutic adaptations, (6) effects on medication, (7) infection control measures, (8), changes in patients’ demands, engagement, and mental health, and (9) impacts on staff and team. Many services were closed intermittently or considerably reduced while telepsychiatric services were extensively expanded. Face-to-face services decreased, as did the work with therapeutic groups. Many inpatient units restructured their services to accommodate COVID-19 patients. While the digitalisation of services allowed for better access to services for some, restrictive measures hindered access for most. Staff experienced changes such as heightened impacts on their own mental health, burdens on patients and the pausing of professional training. Clearly, diverse findings of studies relate to different (national) contexts, type of service offered, but also to the time of the investigation, as studies noted several distinct phases of change during the pandemic. This review suggests directions for policy and service development, such as fostering community services and providing support services for particularly vulnerable populations.

AB  - Summary
The Coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization. Since then, the scientific community has been actively engaged in developing a vaccine against the dreaded disease. Considerable research has also been performed for drugs that can directly interfere with the viral replication pathway. However, the production of these vaccines and drugs demands a lot of time and effort which is undesirable considering the pace at which the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading across the continents. For this reason, the possible role of dietary nutrients in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as mitigating the symptoms, may be explored. These natural substances are readily available, have negligible side effects and confer several benefits to the immune system. Macronutrients like proteins are vital for antibody production. Dietary constituents such as omega-3-fatty acids, vitamin C, vitamin E, phytochemicals such as carotenoids and polyphenols exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This review highlights the significance of relevant nutrients in boosting the immune system.

AB  - On January 2020, WHO confirmed the epidemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 as a Health Emergency of International Concern. The aim of this meta-meta-analysis is quantifying meta-analytic findings on the association of cardiovascular disease (CVD) comorbidities and COVID-19 severity. Findings suggest that chances of getting severe COVID-19 disease in patients with CVD is greater than those without CVD. Also, prevalence of CVD in patents with COVID-19 is 0.08 (95% CI = 0.07–0.08). The OR as 3.44 indicates that the odds of getting severe COVID-19 is more than 3 times higher in those with CVD. Also, prevalence of hypertension in patient with COVID-19 is 0.27 (95%CI = 0.27–0.28) and the OR as 2.68 indicates that the odds of getting severe COVID-19 in cases with high blood pressure is more than 2.5 times higher than those without hypertension. It is rational to suppose that persons with coronary artery disease are prone to severe viral infection thereby, guideline-directed diagnosis and medical therapy is vital in CVD patients.

The SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a spectrum of non-specific signs and symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic infection, to flu-like illness such as fever, cough, dry cough and fatigue, to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even multi-organ failures with high morbidity and mortality. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets that infected people exhale during incubation and onset period. By 12 June 2020, over 7.5 million confirmed cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with more than 421,000 deaths in the world have been reported to the WHO. No specific medication is approved to treat COVID-19, raising the urgent need for antiviral drug development. By 12 June 2020, there are over 1000 clinical trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov for treatment of COVID-19. This review summarizes the epidemiology, virology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and particularly the antiviral drugs currently under clinical trials for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, together with the challenges and perspectives of this disease are also discussed.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an unprecedented disease caused by highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 and characterized by extreme respiratory deterrence, pneumonia and immune damage. The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the sequence similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other SARS-like bat viruses. The primary source and intermediate host are not yet confirmed, although transmission from human to human is universally confirmed. The new SARS-CoV-2 virus reaches cells via ACE-2 and subsequently down-regulates ACE-2, leaving angiotensin II unbalanced in affected organs primarily in the lungs, heart, brain, and kidneys. As reported recently, numerous secondary complications i.e., neurological, nephrological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune, and hepatic complications, are associated with COVID-19 infection along with prominent respiratory disease including pneumonia. Extensive research work on recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 is in the pipeline to clarify pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiological features, and identify new drug targets that will lead to the development of successful strategies for prevention and treatment. There are currently no appropriate scientifically approved vaccines/drugs for COVID-19. Nonetheless, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, azithromycin were tested against COVID-19 in clinical trials, and finally, FDA approved emergency use of remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Additionally, administration of convalescent plasma obtained from recovered COVID-19 patients to infected COVID-19 patients reduces the viral burden via immunomodulation. This review analysis therefore concentrates primarily on recent discoveries related to COVID-19 pathogenesis along with a full description of the structure, genome, and secondary complication associated with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, a short and brief clinical update has been provided concerning the development of therapeutic medications and vaccines to counter COVID-19.

AB  - COVID-19 is a new pandemic, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-Cov2) infection and characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. Inflammation and the innate immune system have been recently recognized as pivotal players in the most severe forms, characterized by significantly elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this setting, several studies have also reported the presence of abnormalities in coagulation parameters and platelets count, possibly identifying a subgroup of patients with poor prognosis. Some reports of full-blown thromboembolic events are emerging. Among the possible mechanisms underlying coagulation dysfunction, the so-called "cytokine storm" seems to play a pivotal role. Other candidate factors include virus-specific mechanisms, related to the virus interaction with renin angiotensin system (RAS) and the fibrinolytic pathway, but also comorbidities affecting these patients. Coagulation dysfunction is therefore a candidate risk factor for adverse outcomes in COVID-19 and should be carefully addressed in clinical practice.

AB  - Summary
Invasive mould disease (IMD) might affect up to a third of critically ill patients with COVID-19. COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is typically diagnosed on the basis of a combination of non-specific clinical, radiographical, and mycological findings, but whether most cases represent invasive disease is unresolved. We systematically reviewed autopsy series of three or more decedents with COVID-19 for evidence of IMD. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, OVID (Embase), and medRxiv for studies in English or French published from Jan 1, 2019, to Sept 26, 2020. We identified 1070 references, of which 50 studies met the criteria. These studies described autopsies from 677 decedents, with individual-level data for 443 decedents. The median age was 70·0 years (IQR 57·0–79·0). Of decedents with individual-level data, 133 (30%) had diabetes, 97 (22%) had pre-existing lung disease, and 27 (6%) had immunocompromising conditions. Of 548 decedents with such data, 320 (58%) received invasive mechanical ventilation; among 140 decedents for whom this was known, ventilation was for a median of 9·0 days (IQR 5·0–20·0). Treatment included immunomodulation in 60 decedents and antifungals in 50 decedents. Autopsy-proven IMD occurred in 11 (2%) of 677 decedents, including eight CAPA, two unspecified IMD, and one disseminated mucormycosis. Among 320 decedents who received mechanical ventilation, six (2%) had IMD. We conclude that IMD, including CAPA, is an uncommon autopsy finding in COVID-19.

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affecting the lungs. All tobacco-related illnesses including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease are known to reduce the lung capacity and impair the immune system of the body and can greatly influence the ability to fight the novel coronavirus. The purpose of this state-of-the-art literature review is to summarize the evidence of the association of tobacco use with the severity of the COVID-19 manifestations.
Method
Articles describing the association of tobacco use with the severity of COVID-19 manifestations were searched on PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google. This review covers the relevant studies on the subject published from January 1, 2020 to September 10, 2020.
Results
Tobacco use in all forms, whether smoking or chewing, is significantly associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. Pre-existing comorbidities in tobacco users such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases and hypertension were found to further aggravate the disease manifestations making the treatment of such COVID-19 patients more challenging due to their rapid clinical deterioration.
Conclusions
Current review indicates that nicotine exposure is linked to cardiopulmonary vulnerability to COVID-19 and tobacco use can be a potential risk factor for not only getting the viral infection but also its severe manifestations. The current pandemic provides a teachable moment to break the cycle of nicotine addiction and accelerate national tobacco control programs to achieve a tobacco-free world.

AB  - While COVID-19, the disease driven by SARS-CoV-2 has ignited interest in the host immune response to this infection, it has also highlighted the lack of treatment options for the damaging inflammatory responses driven by pathogens that precipitate the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). With the global prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the likelihood of a second winter spike alongside seasonal flu, the need for effective and targeted anti-inflammatory agents is even more pressing. Here we discuss the aetiology of COVID-19 and the common signalling pathways driven by SARS-CoV-2, namely p38 MAP kinase. We highlight that p38 MAP kinase becomes elevated with increasing age, thereby driving many of the inflammatory pathways that precipitate death in old people with the added drawback of impairing vaccine efficacy in this susceptible age group. Finally, we review drugs available to inhibit p38 MAP kinase, their risks-versus-benefits as well as suggested dosing regimen to combat over-exuberant innate immune responses and potentially reverse vaccine inefficacy in older patients.

AB  - Currently, the world is facing a Coronavirus pandemic with a grave deficiency of specific therapy for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). Moreover, scientists attempt to discover the most refined approach to prevent this condition. Regarding COVID-19 infection, herbal medicines with immunomodulatory effects may offer patients a promising preventive treatment option. Several ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are effective during this worrisome Coronavirus pandemic i.e. Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers, Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal, Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Curcuma longa L. etc. TCM was shown to be utilized with over 90% efficacy when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in early 2020. In addition to herbal treatments and nutraceutical drugs, dietary supplements such as vitamins and amino acid derivatives also play a significant part in COVID-19 management. Diet can assist in regulating inflammation, while nutraceuticals can aid in the prevention of viral invasion. Functional amino acids (e.g., arginine, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, taurine, and tryptophan) and glutathione, which are all abundant in animal-sourced foodstuffs, are crucial for optimum immunity and health in humans and animals. The goal of this article is to thoroughly evaluate recent statistics on the effectiveness of herbal medicines in COVID-19, the antiviral activity of nutraceuticals, and the significance of these results in creating dietary supplements that would enhance innate immunity and contribute as preventive measures against severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

AB  - Objectives
To better understand the impact of comprehensive COVID-19 targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on influenza burden worldwide.
Methods
We conducted a systematic literature search in selected databases (PubMed, WHO COVID-19), preprint servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv) and websites of European Public Health institutes. Documents that compared influenza estimates in the 2019/2020 season with previous seasons were included. Information synthesis was qualitative due to a high heterogeneity in the number and periods of comparative seasons, outcome measures and statistical methods.
Results
We included 23 records reporting from 15 countries/regions as well as 8 reports from European Public Health agencies. Estimates in the 2019/2020 season based on influenza virus tests (4 out of 7 countries/regions), defined influenza cases (8 out of 9), influenza positivity rate (7 out of 8), and severe complications (1 out of 2) were lower than in former seasons. Results from syndromic indicators, such as influenza-like-illness (ILI), were less clear or even raised (4 out of 7) after the influenza season indicating a misclassification with COVID-19 cases.
Conclusions
Evidence synthesis suggests that NPIs targeted at SARS-CoV-2-transmission reduce influenza burden as well. Low threshold NPIs need to be more strongly emphasized in influenza prevention strategies.

AB  - With the increasing prevalence of obesity, there is a growing awareness of its impact on infectious diseases. In past epidemics of influenza A and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, obesity has been identified as a risk factor influencing the severity of illness in infected persons. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a large number of deaths and health damages worldwide. Increasing numbers of reports have linked obesity to more severe COVID-19 disease and death. This review focuses on the impact of obesity on patients with COVID-19. We comprehensively analyzed the various mechanisms of obesity affecting the severity of the disease. In addition, on the basis of the vulnerability of people with obesity during the COVID-19 epidemic, we summarized both individual-level and hospital-level prevention and management measures for COVID-19 patients with obesity and discussed the impact of isolation on people with obesity.

AB  - Background
Currently, novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak creates global panic across the continents, as people from almost all countries and territories have been affected by this highly contagious viral disease. The scenario is deteriorating due to lack of proper & specific target-oriented pharmacologically safe prophylactic agents or drugs, and or any effective vaccine. drug development is urgently required to back in the normalcy in the community and to combat this pandemic.
Purpose
Thus, we have proposed two novel drug targets, Furin and TMPRSS2, as Covid-19 treatment strategy. We have highlighted this target-oriented novel drug delivery strategy, based on their pathophysiological implication on SARS-CoV-2 infection, as evident from earlier SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and influenza virus infection via host cell entry, priming, fusion, and endocytosis.
Study design &  Methods
An earlier study suggested that Furin and TMPRSS2 knockout mice had reduced level of viral load and a lower degree of organ damage such as the lung. The present study thus highlights the promise of some selected novel and potential anti-viral Phytopharmaceutical that bind to Furin and TMPRSS2 as target.
Result
Few of them had shown promising anti-viral response in both preclinical and clinical study with acceptable therapeutic safety-index.
Conclusion
Hence, this strategy may limit life-threatening Covid-19 infection and its mortality rate through nano-suspension based intra-nasal or oral nebulizer spray, to treat mild to moderate SARS-COV-2 infection when Furin and TMPRSS2 receptor may initiate to express and activate for processing the virus to cause cellular infection by replication within the host cell and blocking of host-viral interaction.

AB  - Background
Cardiovascular disease related mortality is the leading cause of death in the United States, with hypertension being the most prevalent and potent risk factor. For decades hypertension has disproportionately affected African Americans, who also have a higher burden of associated comorbidities including diabetes and heart failure.
Methods
Current literature including guideline reports and newer studies on hypertension in African Americans in PubMed were reviewed. We also reviewed newer publications on the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease.
Findings
While APOL1 has been theorized in the epidemiology of hypertension, the increased prevalence and associated risks are primarily due to environmental and lifestyle factors. These factors include poor diet, adverse lifestyle, and social determinants. Hypertension control can be achieved by lifestyle modifications such as low sodium diet, weight loss, and adequate physical activity. When lifestyle modifications alone do not adequately control hypertension, a common occurrence among African Americans who suffer with greater prevalence of resistant hypertension, pharmacological intervention is indicated. The efficacy of renal denervation, and the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 and aminopeptidase A inhibitors, have been studied for treatment of resistant hypertension. Furthermore, the recent COVID-19 crisis has been particularly devastating among African Americans who demonstrate increased incidence and poorer health outcomes related to the disease.
Conclusion
The disparities in outcomes, which are largely attributable to a greater prevalence of comorbidities such as hypertension and obesity, in addition to adverse environmental and socioeconomic factors, highlight the necessity of specialized clinical approaches and programs for African Americans to address longstanding barriers to equitable care.

AB  - Background and aim
The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected the world’s population in the last two years. Along with non-pharmacological public health interventions, major efforts have also been made to identify effective drugs or active substances for COVID-19 prevention and treatment. These include, among many others, the trace elements zinc and selenium, based on laboratory studies and some observational human studies. However, both of these study designs are not adequate to identify and approve treatments in human medicine, and experimental studies in the form of randomized controlled trials are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness and the safety of any interventions.
Methods
We undertook a systematic review in which we searched for published and unpublished clinical trials using zinc or selenium supplementation to treat or prevent COVID-19 in the Pubmed, Scopus and ClinicalTrials databases up to 10 January 2022.
Results
Amongst the published studies, we did not find any trial with selenium, whereas we retrieved four eligible randomized clinical trials using zinc supplementation, only one of which was double-blind. One of these trials looked at the effect of the intervention on the rate of new SARS-CoV-2 infections, and three at the COVID-19 clinical outcome in already infected individuals. The study populations of the four trials were very heterogeneous, ranging from uninfected individuals to those hospitalized for COVID-19. Only two studies investigated zinc alone in the intervention arm with no differences in the endpoints. The other two studies examined zinc in association with one or more drugs and supplements in the intervention arm, therefore making it impossible to disentangle any specific effects of the element. In addition, we identified 22 unpublished ongoing clinical trials, 19 on zinc, one on selenium and two on both elements.
Conclusion
No trials investigated the effect of selenium supplementation on COVID-19, while the very few studies on the effects of zinc supplementation did not confirm efficacy. Therefore, preventive or therapeutic interventions against COVID-19 based on zinc or selenium supplementation are currently unjustified, although when the results of the on-going studies are published, this may change our conclusion.

AB  - The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has quickly become a daunting challenge to global health. In the absence of targeted therapy and a reported 5.5% case fatality rate in the United States, treatments preventing rapid cardiopulmonary failure are urgently needed. Clinical features, pathology and homology to better understood pathogens suggest that uncontrolled inflammation and a cytokine storm likely drive COVID-19's unrelenting disease process. Interventions that are protective against acute lung injury and ARDS can play a critical role for patients and health systems during this pandemic. Nitric oxide is an antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory molecule with key roles in pulmonary vascular function in the context of viral infections and other pulmonary disease states. This article reviews the rationale for exogenous nitric oxide use for the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and highlights its potential for contributing to better clinical outcomes and alleviating the rapidly rising strain on healthcare capacity.

AB  - From the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic it became evident that children infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain mostly asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. We reviewed the epidemiologic and clinical features of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The true prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is most likely underestimated, as asymptomatic children are less frequently tested. Serologic surveys indicate that half of children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 report no symptoms. Anosmia/ageusia is not frequent in children but it is the strongest predictor of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. In general, children with COVID-19 are at lower risk of hospitalization and life-threatening complications. Nevertheless, cases of severe disease or a post-infectious multisystem hyperinflammatory syndrome named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) have been described. Rarely children with severe COVID-19 develop neurologic complications. In addition, studies indicate that school closures have a limited impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, much less than other social distancing measures. The past months new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged with higher transmissibility and an increased impact on morbidity and deaths. The role of children in the transmission dynamics of these variants must be elucidated. Lastly, preliminary results from COVID-19 vaccine trials indicate very good efficacy and tolerability in children. Very recently the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities recommend vaccination of children 12 years or older to protect them but mostly to contribute to the achievement of herd immunity.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has affected over 200 million people globally (including over 30 million people in the United States), with children comprising 12.9% of reported cases in the United States. In children, COVID-19 infection appears to be associated with mild respiratory symptoms; however, serious neurological complications may occur in conjunction with multisystem inﬂammatory syndrome. A wide spectrum of neurological diseases have been observed in children with COVID-19 infection including encephalitis, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, cytotoxic lesion of the callosal splenium, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, venous sinus thrombosis, vasculitis and infarction, Guillain–Barré syndrome, transverse myelitis, and myositis. This review describes the characteristic magnetic resonance neuroimaging features of these diseases and their differentiations from other imaging mimics. In addition, we review the possible pathophysiology underlying the association between these diseases and COVID-19-infection. As new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge and COVID-19 infection continues to spread worldwide, pediatricians, radiologists, and first-line care givers should be aware of possible neurological diseases associated with COVID-19 infection when these reported neuroimaging patterns are observed in children during this pandemic.

Vaccine induced immune mediated thrombocytopenia or VITT, is a recent and rare phenomenon of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, frequently including cerebral venous thromboses (CVT), that has been described following vaccination with adenovirus vaccines ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 (AstraZeneca) and Ad26.COV2·S Johnson and Johnson (Janssen/J&J). The evaluation and management of suspected cases of CVT post COVID-19 vaccination are critical skills for a broad range of healthcare providers.
Methods
A collaborative comprehensive review of literature was conducted among a global group of expert neurologists and hematologists.
Findings
Strategies for rapid evaluation and treatment of the CVT in the context of possible VITT exist, including inflammatory marker measurements, PF4 assays, and non-heparin anticoagulation.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the world, despite all efforts in infection control and treatment/vaccine development. Hospitals are currently overcrowded, with health statuses of patients often being hard to gauge. Therefore, methods for determining infection severity need to be developed so that high-risk patients can be prioritized, resources can be efficiently distributed, and fatalities can be prevented. Electrochemical prognostic biosensing of various biomarkers may hold promise in solving these problems as they are low-cost and provide timely results. Therefore, we have reviewed the literature and extracted the most promising biomarkers along with their most favourable electrochemical sensors. The biomarkers discussed in this paper are C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukins (ILs), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interferons (IFNs), glutamate, breath pH, lymphocytes, platelets, neutrophils and D-dimer. Metabolic syndrome is also discussed as comorbidity for COVID-19 patients, as it increases infection severity and raises chances of becoming infected. Cannabinoids, especially cannabidiol (CBD), are discussed as a potential adjunct therapy for COVID-19 as their medicinal properties may be desirable in minimizing the neurodegenerative or severe inflammatory damage caused by severe COVID-19 infection. Currently, hospitals are struggling to provide adequate care; thus, point-of-care electrochemical sensor development needs to be prioritized to provide an approximate prognosis for hospital patients. During and following the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, electrochemical sensors can also be integrated into wearable and portable devices to help patients monitor recovery while returning to their daily lives. Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, these sensors will also prove useful for monitoring inflammation-based diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Purpose
Childhood obesity is a global epidemic and a chronic disease. Multifactorial determinants have long been linked with childhood obesity. These have been challenged with the onset of COVID-19 and the associated mitigation measures. The study aimed to re-highlight these determinants while exploring the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on these pre-existing childhood obesity determinants, while providing evidence that may be beneficial for the post-COVID-19 recovery plan.
Methods
A PubMed literature search (2016–2021) using the keywords, “childhood obesity”, “gender”, “sex”, “obesity in youth”, “obesity in adolescents”, “COVID-19″ and “SARS-CoV2” was performed.
Results
Genetic predisposition, biologically low leptin levels, certain cultural beliefs and socio-economic statuses, as well as exposure to an “obesogenic” environment were found to have a positive association with childhood obesity. Additionally, the onset of COVID-19 further aggravates the childhood obesity epidemic, increasing childrens’ susceptibility to obesity and all associated consequential diseases.
Discussion
A possible key to the control and prevention of the burden of childhood obesity, lies in dealing with its precursors and risk factors. Certain factors, including socio-cultural norms, cultural beliefs and geographical factors are amenable. COVID-19 further challenged these and it is evident that the childhood obesity epidemic is still a critical one. Encouraging preventative interventions, such as screening programs, public awareness and policies targeting the environment, amongst others, are recommended.

AB  - Summary
During the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, EASL and ESCMID published a position paper to provide guidance for physicians involved in the care of patients with chronic liver disease. While some healthcare systems are returning to a more normal routine, many countries and healthcare systems have been, or still are, overwhelmed by the pandemic, which is significantly impacting on the care of these patients. In addition, many studies have been published focusing on how COVID-19 may affect the liver and how pre-existing liver diseases might influence the clinical course of COVID-19. While many aspects remain poorly understood, it has become increasingly evident that pre-existing liver diseases and liver injury during the disease course must be kept in mind when caring for patients with COVID-19. This review should serve as an update on the previous position paper, summarising the evidence for liver disease involvement during COVID-19 and providing recommendations on how to return to routine care wherever possible.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has affected more than 20 million people in Brazil and caused a global health emergency. This virus has the potential to affect various parts of the body and compromise metabolic functions. The virus-mediated neural inflammation of the nervous system is due to a storm of cytokines and oxidative stress, which are the clinical features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This neurodegenerative disease is aggravated in cases involving SARS-CoV-2 and its inflammatory biomarkers, accelerating accumulation of β-amyloid peptide, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and production of reactive oxygen species, which lead to homeostasis imbalance. The cholinergic system, through neurons and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), modulates various physiological pathways, such as the response to stress, sleep and wakefulness, sensory information, and the cognitive system. Patients with AD have low concentrations of ACh; hence, therapeutic methods are aimed at adjusting the ACh titers available to the body for maintaining functionality. Herein, we focused on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, responsible for the degradation of ACh in the synaptic cleft, and muscarinic and nicotinic receptor agonists of the cholinergic system owing to the therapeutic potential of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in AD associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - COVID-19 disease has put life of people in stress worldwide from many aspects. Since the virus has mutated in absolutely short period of time the challenge to find a suitable vaccine has become harder. Infection to COVID-19, especially at severe life threatening states is highly dependent on the strength of the host immune system. This system is partially dependent on the balance between oxidative stress and antioxidant. Besides, this virus still has unknown mechanism of action companied by a probable commune period. From another hand, some reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels can be helpful on the state determination of the disease. Thus it could be possible to use modern bioanalytical techniques for their detection and determination, which could indicate the disease state at the golden time window since they have the potential to show whether specific DNA, RNA, enzymes and proteins are affected. This also could be used as a preclude study or a reliable pathway to define the best optimized time of cure beside effective medical actions. Herein, some ROS and their relation with SARS-CoV-2 virus have been considered. In addition, modern bioelectroanalytical techniques on this approach from quantitative and qualitative points of view have been reviewed.

AB  - Propolis, a resinous material produced by honey bees from plant exudates, has long been used in traditional herbal medicine and is widely consumed as a health aid and immune system booster. The COVID-19 pandemic has renewed interest in propolis products worldwide; fortunately, various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism are potential targets for propolis compounds. SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is characterized by viral spike protein interaction with cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serine protease TMPRSS2. This mechanism involves PAK1 overexpression, which is a kinase that mediates coronavirus-induced lung inflammation, fibrosis, and immune system suppression. Propolis components have inhibitory effects on the ACE2, TMPRSS2 and PAK1 signaling pathways; in addition, antiviral activity has been proven in vitro and in vivo. In pre-clinical studies, propolis promoted immunoregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including reduction in IL-6, IL-1 beta and TNF-α. This immunoregulation involves monocytes and macrophages, as well as Jak2/STAT3, NF-kB, and inflammasome pathways, reducing the risk of cytokine storm syndrome, a major mortality factor in advanced COVID-19 disease. Propolis has also shown promise as an aid in the treatment of various of the comorbidities that are particularly dangerous in COVID-19 patients, including respiratory diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. Standardized propolis products with consistent bioactive properties are now available. Given the current emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and limited therapeutic options, propolis is presented as a promising and relevant therapeutic option that is safe, easy to administrate orally and is readily available as a natural supplement and functional food.

AB  - The current coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19, is the third outbreak of disease caused by the coronavirus family, after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is an acute infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This severe disease is characterised by acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Currently, no drugs or vaccines exist against the disease and the only course of treatment is symptom management involving mechanical ventilation, immune suppressants, and repurposed drugs. The severe form of the disease has a relatively high mortality rate. The last six months have seen an explosion of information related to the host receptors, virus transmission, virus structure-function relationships, pathophysiology, co-morbidities, immune response, treatment and the most promising vaccines. This review takes a critically comprehensive look at various aspects of the host-pathogen interaction in COVID-19. We examine the genomic aspects of SARS-CoV-2, modulation of innate and adaptive immunity, complement-triggered microangiopathy, and host transmission modalities. We also examine its pathophysiological impact during pregnancy, in addition to emphasizing various gaps in our knowledge. The lessons learnt from various clinical trials involving repurposed drugs have been summarised. We also highlight the rationale and likely success of the most promising vaccine candidates.

AB  - Background
Vaccines are critical cost-effective tools to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the emergence of variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may threaten the global impact of mass vaccination campaigns.
Aims
The objective of this study was to provide an up-to-date comparative analysis of the characteristics, adverse events, efficacy, effectiveness and impact of the variants of concern for 19 COVID-19 vaccines.
Sources
References for this review were identified through searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, regulatory drug agencies and pharmaceutical companies' websites up to 22nd September 2021.
Content
Overall, all COVID-19 vaccines had a high efficacy against the original strain and the variants of concern, and were well tolerated. BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 and Sputnik V after two doses had the highest efficacy (>90%) in preventing symptomatic cases in phase III trials. mRNA vaccines, AZD1222, and CoronaVac were effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and severe infections against Alpha, Beta, Gamma or Delta variants. Regarding observational real-life data, full immunization with mRNA vaccines and AZD1222 seems to effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection against the original strain and Alpha and Beta variants but with reduced effectiveness against the Delta strain. A decline in infection protection was observed at 6 months for BNT162b2 and AZD1222. Serious adverse event rates were rare for mRNA vaccines—anaphylaxis 2.5–4.7 cases per million doses, myocarditis 3.5 cases per million doses—and were similarly rare for all other vaccines. Prices for the different vaccines varied from $2.15 to $29.75 per dose.
Implications
All vaccines appear to be safe and effective tools to prevent severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and death against all variants of concern, but the quality of evidence greatly varies depending on the vaccines considered. Questions remain regarding a booster dose and waning immunity, the duration of immunity, and heterologous vaccination. The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risks, despite rare serious adverse effects.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 remains an international concern. Although there are drugs to fight it, new natural alternatives such as polyphenols are essential due to their antioxidant activity and high antiviral potential. In this context, this review reports the main findings on the effect of phenolic compounds (PCs) against SARS-CoV-2 virus. First, the proven activity of PCs against different human viruses is briefly detailed, which serves as a starting point to study their anti-COVID-19 potential. SARS-CoV-2 targets (its proteins) are defined. Findings from in silico, in vitro and in vivo studies of a wide variety of phenolic compounds are shown, emphasizing their mechanism of action, which is fundamental for drug design. Furthermore, clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of PCs in the prevention and as a possible therapeutic management against COVID-19. The results were complemented with information on the influence of polyphenols in strengthening/modulating the immune system. It is recommended to investigate compounds such as vitamins, minerals, alkaloids, triterpenes and fatty acids, and their synergistic use with PCs, many of which have been successful against SARS-CoV-2. Based on findings on other viruses, synergistic evaluation of PCs with accepted drugs against COVID-19 is also suggested. Other recommendations and limitations are also shown, which is useful for professionals involved in the development of efficient, safe and low-cost therapeutic strategies based on plant matrices rich in PCs. To the authors' knowledge, this manuscript is the first to evaluate the relationship between the antiviral and immunomodulatory (including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects) activity of PCs and their underlying mechanisms in relation to the fight against COVID-19. It is also of interest for the general population to be informed about the importance of consuming foods rich in bioactive compounds for their health benefits.

AB  - The global scope of pollution from plastic waste is a well-known phenomenon associated with trade, mass consumption, and disposal of plastic products (e.g., personal protective equipment (PPE), viral test kits, and vacuum-packaged food). Recently, the scale of the problem has been exacerbated by increases in indoor livelihood activities during lockdowns imposed in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The present study describes the effects of increased plastic waste on environmental footprint and human health. Further, the technological/regulatory options and life cycle assessment (LCA) approach for sustainable plastic waste management are critically dealt in terms of their implications on energy resilience and circular economy. The abrupt increase in health-care waste during pandemic has been worsening environmental quality to undermine the sustainability in general. In addition, weathered plastic particles from PPE along with microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) can all adsorb chemical and microbial contaminants to pose a risk to ecosystems, biota, occupational safety, and human health. PPE-derived plastic pollution during the pandemic also jeopardizes sustainable development goals, energy resilience, and climate control measures. However, it is revealed that the pandemic can be regarded as an opportunity for explicit LCA to better address the problems associated with environmental footprints of plastic waste and to focus on sustainable management technologies such as circular bio-economies, biorefineries, and thermal gasification. Future researches in the energy-efficient clean technologies and circular bio-economies (or biorefineries) in concert with a “nexus” framework are expected to help reduce plastic waste into desirable directions.

AB  - Summary
Disruptions to cancer screening services have been experienced in most settings as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ideally, programmes would resolve backlogs by temporarily expanding capacity; however, in practice, this is often not possible. We aim to inform the deliberations of decision makers in high-income settings regarding their cervical cancer screening policy response. We caution against performance measures that rely solely on restoring testing volumes to pre-pandemic levels because they will be less effective at mitigating excess cancer diagnoses than will targeted measures. These measures might exacerbate pre-existing inequalities in accessing cervical screening by disregarding the risk profile of the individuals attending. Modelling of cervical screening outcomes before and during the pandemic supports risk-based strategies as the most effective way for screening services to recover. The degree to which screening is organised will determine the feasibility of deploying some risk-based strategies, but implementation of age-based risk stratification should be universally feasible.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 is associated with excessive inflammation, as a main reason for severe condition and death. Increased inflammatory cytokines and humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 correlate with COVID-19 immunity and pathogenesis. Importantly, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that increase profoundly in systemic circulation appear as part of the clinical pictures of two overlapping conditions, sepsis and the hemophagocytic syndromes. Both conditions can develop lethal inflammatory responses that lead to tissue damage, however, in many patients hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) can be differentiated from sepsis. This is a key issue because the life-saving aggressive immunosuppressive treatment, required in the HLH therapy, is absent in sepsis guidelines. This paper aims to describe the pathophysiology and clinical relevance of these distinct entities in the course of COVID-19 that resemble sepsis and further highlights two effector arms of the humoral immune response (inflammatory cytokine and immunoglobulin production) during COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Cholesterol is being recognized as a molecule involved in regulating the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the host cell. However, the data about the possible role of cholesterol carrying lipoproteins and their receptors in relation to infection are scarce and the connection of lipid-associated pathologies with COVID-19 disease is in its infancy. Herein we provide an overview of lipids and lipid metabolism in relation to COVID-19, with special attention on different forms of cholesterol. Cholesterol enriched lipid rafts represent a platform for viruses to enter the host cell by endocytosis. Generally, higher membrane cholesterol coincides with higher efficiency of COVID-19 entry. Inversely, patients with COVID-19 show lowered levels of blood cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins. The modulated efficiency of viral entry can be explained by availability of SR-B1 receptor. HDL seems to have a variety of roles, from being itself a scavenger for viruses, an immune modulator and mediator of viral entry. Due to inverse roles of membrane cholesterol and lipoprotein cholesterol in COVID-19 infected patients, treatment of these patients with cholesterol lowering statins needs more attention. In conclusion, cholesterol and lipoproteins are potential markers for monitoring the viral infection status, while the lipid metabolic pathways and the composition of membranes could be targeted to selectively inhibit the life cycle of the virus as a basis for antiviral therapy.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and is associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. Various types of bacterial and fungal infections occur in patients with COVID-19 with some resistant to antimicrobials that are associated with significantly worse outcomes and deaths. Besides, antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) co-infections are responsible for clinically significant mortality in past pandemics. There is evidence to suggest that factors such as the proliferation of adulterated antimicrobials in some developing countries, international travels, issues with healthcare financing, use/misuse by humans, and in agricultural production and climate change are determinants of AMR at various levels of society. These complex interrelated determinants intersect with AMR in current and past pandemics and could amplify the potential of a future antimicrobial resistance pandemic. Therefore, global concerted interventions targeted at all levels of society to reduce the use/misuse of antimicrobials and disrupt these multifaceted, interrelated, and interdependent factors are urgently needed. This paper leverages prior research to describe complex major determinants of antimicrobial resistance and provides fresh insights into possible intervention strategies to tackle antimicrobial resistance including in the current and future pandemics.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a respiratory tract virus that causes Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The virus originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has spread across the globe to-date. The disease ranges from asymptomatic carriers to symptoms such as fever, sore throat, cough, lung infections, and in severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and death. As many as 50% of patients reported having at least one comorbidities with COVID-19 upon hospital admission. Hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases are among the most commonly reported. Comorbidities are contributing to acute disease prognosis and increased risk of severe symptoms. Around 70% of patients who require ICU care have been observed to have comorbidities. This review intends to understand how some of these comorbidities affect the disease’s prognosis and how severe the outcome can be expected.

AB  - The SARS-2 pandemic which has moved with frightening speed over the last 5 months has several synergies with another older, and far more neglected airborne disease, tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis are not only more likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 but also likely to have adverse outcomes once infected. The sequelae of more severe forms of COVID-19 in patients who have recovered from TB but have residual compromised lung function, are also likely to be devastating. These diseases share almost identical bio-social determinants like poverty, overcrowding, diabetes and pollution and some clinical similarities. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our global response to it with lockdowns, are likely to leave a profound and long-lasting impact on TB diagnosis and control, potentially leading to an additional 6.3 million cases of TB between 2020 and 2025, and an additional 1.4 million TB deaths during this time. Novel solutions will need to be urgently devised or else TB control targets will never be met and indeed may be set back by 5–8 years.

AB  - Hyper-inflammatory responses, lymphopenia, unbalanced immune responses, cytokine storm, large viral replication and massive cell death play fundamental roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Extreme production of many kinds of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines occur in severe COVID-19 that called cytokine storm. Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) present in the cytoplasm in an inactive form and can be stimulated by a vast range of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Thus, STAT-3 can participate in the induction of inflammatory responses during coronavirus infections. STAT-3 can also suppress anti-virus interferon response and induce unbalanced anti-virus adaptive immune response, through influencing Th17-, Th1-, Treg-, and B cell-mediated functions. Furthermore, STAT-3 can contribute to the M2 macrophage polarization, lung fibrosis and thrombosis. Moreover, STAT-3 may be directly targeted by some virus-derived protein and operate as a pro-viral or anti-viral element in a virus-specific process. Here, the possible contribution of STAT-3 to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 was explained, while providing potential approaches to target this transcription factor in an attempt for COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - Objective
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a rare and challenging diagnosis requiring early treatment. The diagnostic criteria involve clinical, laboratory, and complementary tests. This review aims to draw pediatrician attention to this diagnosis, suggesting early treatment strategies, and proposing a pediatric emergency care flowchart.
Sources
The PubMed/MEDLINE/WHO COVID-19 databases were reviewed for original and review articles, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, case series, and recommendations from medical societies and health organizations published through July 3, 2020. The reference lists of the selected articles were manually searched to identify any additional articles.
Summary of the findings
COVID-19 infection is less severe in children than in adults, but can present as MIS-C, even in patients without comorbidities. There is evidence of an exacerbated inflammatory response with potential systemic injury, and it may present with aspects similar to those of Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome. MIS-C can develop weeks after COVID-19 infection, suggesting an immunomediated cause. The most frequent clinical manifestations include fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, mucous membrane changes, and cardiac dysfunction. Elevated inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, and coagulopathy are common laboratory findings. Supportive treatment and early immunomodulation can control the intense inflammatory response and reduce complications and mortality.
Conclusions
MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is serious, rare, and potentially fatal. The emergency department pediatrician must recognize and treat it early using immunomodulatory strategies to reduce systemic injury. Further studies are needed to identify the disease pathogenesis and establish the most appropriate treatment.

AB  - Rapid changes in the viral genome allow viruses to evade threats posed by the host immune response or antiviral drugs, and can lead to viral persistence in the host cells. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an essential enzyme in RNA viruses, which is involved in RNA synthesis through the formation of phosphodiester bonds. Therefore, in RNA viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2, RdRp could be a crucial therapeutic target. The present review discusses the promising application of RdRp inhibitors, previously approved or currently being tested in human clinical trials, in the treatment of RNA virus infections. Nucleoside inhibitors (NIs) bind to the active site of RdRp, while nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) bind to allosteric sites. Given the absence of highly effective drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, the discovery of an efficient treatment for this pandemic is an urgent concern for researchers around the world. We review the evidence for molnupiravir (MK-4482, EIDD-2801), an antiviral drug originally designed for Alphavirus infections, as a potential preventive and therapeutic agent for the management of COVID-19. At the beginning of this pandemic, molnupiravir was in preclinical development for seasonal influenza. When COVID-19 spread dramatically, the timeline for development was accelerated to focus on the treatment of this pandemic. Real time consultation with regulators took place to expedite this program. We summarize the therapeutic potential of RdRp inhibitors, and highlight molnupiravir as a new small molecule drug for COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - An increasing amount of reports in the literature is showing that medical ozone (O3) is used, with encouraging results, in treating COVID-19 patients, optimizing pain and symptoms relief, respiratory parameters, inflammatory and coagulation markers and the overall health status, so reducing significantly how much time patients underwent hospitalization and intensive care. To date, aside from mechanisms taking into account the ability of O3 to activate a rapid oxidative stress response, by up-regulating antioxidant and scavenging enzymes, no sound hypothesis was addressed to attempt a synopsis of how O3 should act on COVID-19. The knowledge on how O3 works on inflammation and thrombosis mechanisms is of the utmost importance to make physicians endowed with new guns against SARS-CoV2 pandemic. This review tries to address this issue, so to expand the debate in the scientific community.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic has stimulated study of the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS), and how it can be manipulated to treat COVID-19. Studies are examining whether drugs that act on the RAAS system might be useful to treat COVID-19. COVID-19 and the RAAS are closely linked both in infection and in possible post-infection inflammatory cascades. We detail the Physiology and Pharmacology of the RAAS including the effects of aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide. It is appropriate that the theoretical benefits of modulation of the RAAS should be considered based on available knowledge of the complexity of the system. In this short review we have tried to explain the actions of the angiotensin family of peptides and produce a relatively simple model and diagrammatic summary of the RAAS and the possible sites of intervention.

We briefly present the clinical and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 infection, as well as the co-infections that could be associated with this virus. In the laboratory, PCR is a first-choice technique in the acute phase of the infection, together with antigen and serological studies. Finally, we describe the main objectives of microbiological studies in the deceased in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the main post-mortem microbiological analysis to be carried out in the medico-legal context. The microbiological analysis should aim to detect both SARS-CoV-2 and coinfections, which may also contribute to the cause of death.
Resumen

En primer lugar, se analizan las características taxonómicas del virus, su relación con la familia coronaviridae y su estructura genética. Se presentan brevemente las características clínicas y patológicas de la infección COVID-19 así como las coinfecciones que pueden asociarse a este virus. En el diagnóstico de laboratorio se describe la PCR, técnica de elección en la fase aguda de la infección; los estudios antigénicos y los serológicos. Finalmente se detallan los principales objetivos para los estudios microbiológicos en fallecidos en relación a la pandemia COVID-19 y se describen los principales análisis microbiológicos post- mórtem a realizar en fallecidos en el ámbito forense. Los estudios microbiológicos deben estar dirigidos tanto a la detección del SARS-CoV-2 como de las coinfecciones, que también podrían contribuir a la causa de muerte.

AB  - Despite endorsed and exponential research to improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, efforts have not yet converted into a better prospect for patients infected with the novel coronavirus (2019nCoV), and still, the name of SARS-CoV-2 is coupled with numerous unanswered questions. One of these questions is concerning how this respiratory virus reduces the number of platelets (PLTs)? The results of laboratory examinations showed that about a quarter of COVID-19 cases experience thrombocytopenia, and more remarkably, about half of these patients succumb to the infection due to coagulopathy. These findings have positioned PLTs as a pillar in the management as well as stratifying COVID-19 patients; however, not all the physicians came into a consensus about the prognostic value of these cells. The current review aims to unravel the contributory role of PLTs s in COVID-19; and alsoto summarize the original data obtained from international research laboratories on the association between COVID-19 and PLT production, activation, and clearance. In addition, we provide a special focus on the prognostic value of PLTs and their related parameters in COVID-19. Questions on how SARS-CoV-2 induces thrombocytopenia are also responded to. The last section provides a general overview of the most recent PLT- or thrombocytopenia-related therapeutic approaches. In conclusion, since SARS-CoV-2 reduces the number of PLTs by eliciting different mechanisms, treatment of thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 patients is not as simple as it appears and serious cautions should be considered to deal with the problem through scrutiny awareness of the causal mechanisms.

AB  - Interferons are the best antiviral agents in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 so far and genetic defects in their signaling cascade or neutralization of alfa-interferons by autoantibodies come with more severe COVID-19. However, there is more, as the SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates not only innate immune mechanisms but also T and B cell repertoires. Most genetic, hematological and immunological studies in COVID-19 are at present phenomenological. However, these and antecedent studies contain the seed grains to resolve many unanswered questions and a whole range of testable hypotheses. What are the links, if existing, between genetics and the occurrence of interferon-neutralizing antibodies? Are NAGGED (neutralizing and generated by gene defect) antibodies involved or not? Is the autoimmune process cause or consequence of virus infection? What are the roles played by cytokine posttranslational modifications, such as proteolysis, glycosylation, citrullination and others? How is systemic autoimmunity linked with type 1 interferons? These questions place cytokines and growth factors at pole positions as keys to unlock basic mechanisms of infection and (auto)immunity. Related to cytokine research, (1) COVID-19 patients develop neutralizing autoantibodies, mainly against alpha interferons and it is not yet established whether this is the consequence or cause of virus replication. (2) The glycosylation of recombinant interferon-beta protects against breaking tolerance and the development of neutralizing antibodies. (3) SARS-CoV-2 induces severe inflammation and release of extracellular proteases leading to remnant epitopes, e.g. of cytokines. (4) In the rare event of homozygous cytokine gene segment deletions, observed neutralizing antibodies may be named NAGGED antibodies. (5) Severe cytolysis releases intracellular content into the extracellular milieu and leads to regulated degradation of intracellular proteins and selection of antibody repertoires, similar to those observed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. (6) Systematic studies of novel autoimmune diseases on single cytokines will complement the present picture about interferons. (7) Interferon neutralization in COVID-19 constitutes a preamble of more studies about cytokine-regulated proteolysis in the control of autoimmunity. Here we reformulate these seven conjectures into testable questions for future research.

AB  - Given the rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its overwhelming effect on health care systems and the global economy, innovative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. The proposed primary culprit of COVID-19 is the intense inflammatory response—an augmented immune response and cytokine storm—severely damaging the lung tissue and rendering some patients’ conditions severe enough to require assisted ventilation. Sex differences in the response to inflammation have been documented and can be attributed, at least in part, to sex steroid hormones. Moreover, age-associated decreases in sex steroid hormones, namely, estrogen and testosterone, may mediate proinflammatory increases in older adults that could increase their risk of COVID-19 adverse outcomes. Sex hormones can mitigate the inflammation response and might provide promising therapeutic potential for patients with COVID-19. In this article, we explore the possible anti-inflammatory effects of estrogen and testosterone and the anabolic effect of testosterone, with particular attention to the potential therapeutic role of hormone replacement therapy in older men and women with COVID-19.

AB  - Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging viral pathogen that causes the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and may result in hypoxemic respiratory failure necessitating invasive mechanical ventilation in the most severe cases.
Objective
This narrative review provides evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of COVID-19 related respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.
Discussion
In severe cases, COVID-19 leads to hypoxemic respiratory failure that may meet criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mainstay of treatment for ARDS includes a lung protective ventilation strategy with low tidal volumes (4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight), adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and maintaining a plateau pressure of < 30 cm H2O. While further COVID-19 specific studies are needed, current management should focus on supportive care, preventing further lung injury from mechanical ventilation, and treating the underlying cause.
Conclusions
This review provides evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of COVID-19 related respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

We consider five regions (Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Umbria, Apulia) which are located in the north, centre and south of Italy. These five regions differ both in their healthcare systems and in the extent to which they were hit by the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate their different responses to COVID-19 reflecting on seven management factors: (1) monitoring, (2) learning, (3) decision-making, (4) coordinating, (5) communicating, (6) leading, and (7) recovering capacity. In light of these factors, we discuss the analogies and differences among the regions and their different institutional choices.

AB  - Introduction
Thrombotic microangiopathies are a group of disorders that are mainly related to endothelial dysfunction. This category of endothelial dysfunction results of several imbalances between platelets, endothelium and immune system, also cytokine production.
Aim of this study
To report cases with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and COVID-19 and review COVID-19 endothelial dysfunction literature.
Methods
Primary laboratory data, peripheral blood smear, ADAMTS13 antigen activity level, and antibody ordered for each of these four patients. Treatments for COVID-19 administered for all patients. Traditional treatments for TTP also were administered.
Results
There were numerous schistocytes (more than 5%) in peripheral blood smears for each patient. ADAMTS13 antigen activity level was below 10%, and ADAMTS13 antibody was elevated for each patient. COVID-19 PCR was positive for all patients, and CT-Scans were indicative of the involvement of COVID-19.
Conclusion
In this case series, we reported four COVID-19 patients who presented with signs and symptoms of anemia and thrombocytopenia, resulting in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

AB  - Summary
We will likely look back on 2020 as a turning point. The pandemic put a spotlight on existing societal issues, accelerated the pace of change in others, and created some new ones too. For example, concerns about inequalities in health by income and race are not new, but they became more apparent to a larger number of people during 2020. The speed and starkness of broadening societal conversation, including beyond the direct effects of COVID-19, create an opportunity and motivation to reassess our understanding of health. Perhaps more importantly, it is an opportunity to reduce inequities in who has access to, who uses, and who benefits from the resources that promote health and well-being. To this end, we offer three questions to guide thinking about health and health inequities after 2020: (1) what do we mean by “health” and “health inequality and inequity”? (2) what are the structures and policies we put in place to support or promote health, and how effective are they? And (3) who has the power to shape structures and policies, and whose interests do those structures and policies serve?

AB  - The COVID‐19 pandemic has become an urgent issue in every country. Based on recent reports, the most severely ill patients present with coagulopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)‐like massive intravascular clot formation is frequently seen in this cohort. Therefore, coagulation tests may be considered useful to discriminate severe cases of COVID‐19. The clinical presentation of COVID‐19‐associated coagulopathy is organ dysfunction primarily, whereas hemorrhagic events are less frequent. Changes in hemostatic biomarkers represented by increase in D‐dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products indicate the essence of coagulopathy is massive fibrin formation. In comparison with bacterial‐sepsis‐associated coagulopathy/DIC, prolongation of prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time, and decrease in antithrombin activity is less frequent and thrombocytopenia is relatively uncommon in COVID‐19. The mechanisms of the coagulopathy are not fully elucidated, however. It is speculated that the dysregulated immune responses orchestrated by inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte cell death, hypoxia, and endothelial damage are involved. Bleeding tendency is uncommon, but the incidence of thrombosis in COVID‐19 and the adequacy of current recommendations regarding standard venous thromboembolic dosing are uncertain.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has caused up to 127 million cases of COVID-19. Approximately 5% of COVID-19 patients develop severe illness, and approximately 40% of those with severe illness eventually die, corresponding to more than 2.78 million people. The pathological characteristics of COVID-19 resemble typical sepsis, and severe COVID-19 has been identified as viral sepsis. Progress in sepsis research is important for improving the clinical care of these patients. Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of sepsis have led to the view that an uncontrolled inflammatory response and oxidative stress are core factors. However, in the traditional treatment of sepsis, it is difficult to achieve a balance between the inflammation, pathogens (viruses, bacteria, and fungi), and patient tolerance, resulting in high mortality of patients with sepsis. In recent years, nanomaterials mediating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and the inflammatory response have shown previously unattainable therapeutic effects on sepsis. Despite these advantages, RONS and inflammatory response-based nanomaterials have yet to be extensively adopted as sepsis therapy. To the best of our knowledge, no review has yet discussed the pathogenesis of sepsis and the application of nanomaterials. To help bridge this gap, we discuss the pathogenesis of sepsis related to inflammation and the overproduction RONS, which activate pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)-PRR signaling pathways. We also summarize the application of nanomaterials in the treatment of sepsis. As highlighted here, this strategy could synergistically improve the therapeutic efficacy against both RONS and inflammation in sepsis and may prolong survival. Current challenges and future developments for sepsis treatment are also summarized.

AB  - We have considered some of the available evidence to account for the impact of SARS-CoV on the regulatory control of the autonomic nervous and respiratory systems. Apart from stimulating general interest in the subject, our hope was to provide putative explanations for some of the patients' symptoms based on described physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms seen in other diseases. Herein, we have focused on the carotid bodies. In this hypothetical viewpoint, we have discussed the plasticity of the carotid body chemoreflex and made a comparison between acute and chronic exposures to high altitude with COVID-19. From these discussions, we have postulated that the sensitivity of the hypoxic ventilatory response may well determine the outcome of disease severity and those that live at high altitude may be more resistant. We have provided insight into silent hypoxia and attempted to explain an absence of ventilatory drive and anxiety yet maintenance of consciousness. In an attempt to discover more about the mysteries of COVID-19, we conclude with questions and some hypothetical studies that may answer them.

AB  - COVID-19 has rapidly spread around the world and threatened global health. Although this disease mainly affects the respiratory system, there is increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 also has effects on the cardiovascular system. Echocardiography is a valuable tool in the assessment of cardiovascular disease. It is cost-effective, widely available and provides information that can influence management. Given the risk of personnel infection and equipment contamination during echocardiography, leading world societies have recommended performing echocardiography only when a clinical benefit is likely, favouring focussed evaluations and using smaller portable equipment. In the past months, multiple reports have described a wide pattern of echocardiographic abnormalities in patients with COVID-19. This review summarises these findings and discusses the possible mechanisms involved.

AB  - Background and aims
The novel SARS-CoV-2 has been rattling the world since its outbreak in December 2019, leading to the COVID-19 pandemic. The learning curve of this new virus has been steep, with a global scientific community desperate to learn how the virus is transmitted, how it replicates, why it causes such a wide spectrum of disease manifestations, resulting in none or few symptoms in some. Others are burdened by an intense immune response that resembles the cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), which leads to severe disease manifestations, often complicated by fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. Research efforts have been focusing on finding effective cures and vaccinations for this virus. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, represented by several GI manifestations, has led to its investigation as a target for the virus and as an indicator of disease severity. The response of the microbiome (which is heavily linked to immunity) to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, and its role in igniting the exaggerated immune response has therefore become a focus of interest. The objective of our study was to gather the data connecting between the microbiome, the GI tract and COVID-19 and to investigate whether these reported alterations in the gut microbiome bear any resemblance to those seen in lupus, the prototypical autoimmune disease. Confirming such changes may become the steppingstone to potential therapies that may prevent transmission, progression and immune related manifestations of COVID-19, via manipulation of the gut microbiota.
Methods
We performed an extensive literature review, utilizing the Pubmed search engine and Google Scholar for studies evaluating the microbiome in COVID-19 patients and compared results with studies evaluating the microbiome in lupus. We searched for the terms: microbiome, dysbiosis, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, gastrointestinal as well as lupus and autoimmune. While there were hundreds of articles which referred to gastrointestinal manifestations in COVID-19, to date only 4 studies investigated the gastrointestinal microbiome in this setting. We compared the similarities between microbiome of COVID-19 patients and lupus patients.
Results
We found that there are several similar processes of immune dysregulation in patients with COVID-19 and in those with lupus, with several other alterations seen in other pathological states. Some of these similarities include loss of microbiota biodiversity, increased representation of pathobionts, which are microbes associated with inflammation and disease (i.e Proteobacteria) and a relative decrease of symbionts, which are protective microbes, associated with anti-inflammatory properties (i.e Lactobacillus). Compromise to the intestinal barrier has also been reported in both.
Conclusions
We conclude that the gastrointestinal tract contributes to the disease manifestations in COVID-19. Whether gastrointestinal dysbiosis is the cause or effect of gastrointestinal manifestations and several severe systemic manifestations, which may be the response to an increased pro-inflammatory environment, is still debatable and warrants further investigation. Given the resemblance of the microbiome in COVID-19 patients to that seen in lupus patients, it becomes clearer why several therapies used in autoimmune conditions are currently under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, these findings should promote further investigating the utility of manipulation of the microbiome, via nutritional supplementation or even fecal transplantations, interventions that may alter the course of the disease, and potentially prevent disease transmission at low cost and low risk.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is more serious in people with underlying diseases, but the cause of healthy people with progressive disease is largely unknown. Host genetic factors such as ACE2 variants, IFITM-3, HLA, TMRSS2, and furin polymorphisms appear to be one of the agents involved in the progression of the COVID-19 and outcome of the disease. This review discusses the general characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including viral features, receptors, cell entry, clinical findings, and the main human genetic factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and get the patients’ situation more complex. Further knowledge in this context may help to find a way to prevent and treat this viral pneumonia.

AB  - The first incidence of COVID-19 was reported in the Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in late December 2019. Because of failure in timely closing of borders of the affected region, COVID-19 spread across like a wildfire through air travel initiating a pandemic. It is a serious lower respiratory track viral infection caused by highly contagious, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronavirus including COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 causes zoonotic diseases and thought to be originated from bats. Since its first incidence, the virus has spread all across the world, causing serious human casualties, economic losses, and disrupting global supply chains. As with SARS-CoV, COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar path of airborne infection, but is less lethal and more infectious than SARS and MERS. This review focusses on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, especially on the dysfunctional immune responses following a cytokine storm in severely affected persons. The mode of entry of SARS-CoV-2 is via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors present on the epithelial lining of lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and mucus membranes. Older persons with weaker immune system and associated co-morbidities are more vulnerable to have dysfunctional immune responses, as most of them concomitantly have severe hypovitaminosis D. Consequently, causing severe damage to key organs of the body including lungs and the cardiovascular system. Since, vast majority of persons enters to the intensive care units and died, had severe vitamin D deficiency, thus, this area must be investigated seriously. In addition, this article assesses the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19. Vitamin D is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system that is exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for entry into the host cells. Further, vitamin D modulates multiple mechanisms of the immune system to contain the virus that includes dampening the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, reduces concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, enhances the production of natural antimicrobial peptide and activates defensive cells such as macrophages that could destroy SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this article provides the urgency of needed evidences through large population based randomized controlled trials and ecological studies to evaluate the potential role of vitamin D in COVID-19.

We aim to describe a case report of myocarditis following administration of the Janssen vaccine in a healthy, young male and review the available literature on COVID-19 vaccine related myocarditis and its possible pathogenesis. This case and literature review notes a temporal association between COVID-19 vaccination and myocarditis. Despite these observations, the benefits of the vaccines far outweigh the risks of possible myocarditis.

AB  - The recent global pandemic due to COVID-19 is caused by a type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2). Despite rigorous efforts worldwide to control the spread and human to human transmission of this virus, incidence and death due to COVID-19 continue to rise. Several drugs have been tested for treatment of COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine. While a number of studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine can prolong QT interval, potentially increasing risk of ventricular arrhythmias and Torsade de Pointes, its effects on immune cell function have not been extensively examined. In the current review, an overview of coronaviruses, viral entry and pathogenicity, immunity upon coronavirus infection, and current therapy options for COVID-19 are briefly discussed. Further based on preclinical studies, we provide evidences that i) hydroxychloroquine impairs autophagy, which leads to accumulation of damaged/oxidized cytoplasmic constituents and interferes with cellular homeostasis, ii) this impaired autophagy in part reduces antigen processing and presentation to immune cells and iii) inhibition of endosome-lysosome system acidification by hydroxychloroquine not only impairs the phagocytosis process, but also potentially alters pulmonary surfactant in the lungs. Therefore, it is likely that hydroxychloroquine treatment may in fact impair host immunity in response to SARS-CoV-2, especially in elderly patients or those with co-morbidities. Further, this review provides a rationale for developing and selecting antiviral drugs and includes a brief review of traditional strategies combined with new drugs to combat COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
Resilient societies respond rapidly and effectively to health challenges and the associated economic consequences, and adapt to be more responsive to future challenges. Although it is only possible to recognise resilience retrospectively, the COVID-19 pandemic has occurred at a point in human history when, uniquely, sufficient knowledge is available on the early-life determinants of health to indicate clearly that a focus on maternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH) will promote later resilience. This knowledge offers an unprecedented opportunity to disrupt entrenched strategies and to reinvest in MNCH in the post-COVID-19 so-called new normal. Furthermore, analysis of the short-term, medium-term, and longer-term consequences of previous socioeconomic shocks provides important insights into those domains of MNCH, such as neurocognitive development and nutrition, for which investment will generate the greatest benefit. Such considerations apply to high-income countries (HICs) and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, implementing appropriate policies in the post-COVID-19 recovery period will be challenging and requires political commitment and public engagement.

AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has placed a spotlight on infectious diseases and their associations with host factors and underlying conditions. New data on the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus are entering the public domain at a rapid rate such that their distillation often lags behind. To minimise weak associations becoming perceived as established paradigms, it is imperative that methodologies and outputs from different studies are appropriately critiqued and compared. In this review, we examine recent data on a potential relationship between smoking and COVID-19. While the causal role of smoking has been firmly demonstrated in regard to lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such associations have the benefit of decades’ worth of multi-centre epidemiological and mechanistic data. From our analysis of the available studies to date, it appears that a relationship is emerging in regard to patients with a smoking history having a higher likelihood of developing more severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease than non-smokers. Data on whether COVID-19 has a greater incidence in smokers than non-smokers is thus far, contradictory and inconclusive. There is therefore a need for some caution to be exercised until further research has been conducted in a wider range of geographical settings with sufficient numbers of patients that have been carefully phenotyped in respect of smoking status and adequate statistical control for confounding factors.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Ever since its emergence, the highly transmissible and debilitating coronavirus disease spread at an incredibly fast rate, causing global devastation in a matter of months. SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, infects hosts after binding to ACE2 receptors present on cells from many structures pertaining to the respiratory, cardiac, hematological, neurological, renal and gastrointestinal systems. COVID-19, however, appears to trigger a severe cytokine storm syndrome in pulmonary structures, resulting in oxidative stress, exacerbated inflammation and alveolar injury. Due to the recent nature of this disease no treatments have shown complete efficacy and safety. More recently, however, researchers have begun to direct some attention towards GSH and NAC. These natural antioxidants play an essential role in several biological processes in the body, especially the maintenance of the redox equilibrium. In fact, many diseases appear to be strongly related to severe oxidative stress and deficiency of endogenous GSH. The high ratios of ROS over GSH, in particular, appear to reflect severity of symptoms and prolonged hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. This imbalance interferes with the body's ability to detoxify the cellular microenvironment, fold proteins, replenish antioxidant levels, maintain healthy immune responses and even modulate apoptotic events. Oral administration of GSH and NAC is convenient and safe, but they are susceptible to degradation in the digestive tract. Considering this drawback, nebulization of GSH and NAC as an adjuvant therapy may therefore be a viable alternative for the management of the early stages of COVID-19.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic is a major challenge for the health systems worldwide. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is one of the most common complications of the COVID-19 infection. The activation of the coagulation system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ARDS. The development of lung coagulopathy involves thrombin generation and fibrinolysis inhibition. Unfractionated heparin and its recently introduced counterpart low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), are widely used anticoagulants with a variety of clinical indications allowing for limited and manageable physio-toxicologic side effects while the use of protamine sulfate, heparin's effective antidote, has made their use even safer. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is approved as intravenous thrombolytic treatment. The present narrative review discusses the use of heparin and tPA in the treatment of COVID-19-induced ARDS and their related potential physio-toxicologic side effects. The article is a quick review of articles on anticoagulation in COVID infection and the potential toxicologic reactions associated with these drugs.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized in December 2019 in China and as of October5th, the pandemic was swept through 216 countries and infected around 34,824,108 individuals, thus posing an unprecedented threat to world's health and economy. Several researchers reported that, a significant mutation in membrane proteins and receptor binding sites of preceding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to turned as novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and disease was named as COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019). Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19 patients. The lessons learned from the past management of SARS-CoV and other pandemics, have provided some insights to treat COVID-19. Currently, therapies like anti-viral treatment, immunomodulatory agents, plasma transfusion and supportive intervention etc., are using to treat the COVID-19. Few of these were proven to provide significant therapeutic benefits in treating the COVID-19, however no drug is approved by the regulatory agencies. As the fatality rate is high in patients with comorbid conditions, we have also enlightened the current in-line treatment therapies and specific treatment strategies in comorbid conditions to combat the emergence of COVID-19. In addition, pharmaceutical, biological companies and research institutions across the globe have begun to develop thesafe and effective vaccine for COVID-19. Globally around 170 teams of researchers are racing to develop the COVID-19 vaccine and here we have discussed about their current status of development. Furthermore, recent patents filed in association with COVID-19 was elaborated. This can help many individuals, researchers or health workers, in applying these principles for diagnosis/prevention/management/treatment of the current pandemic.

KW  - Ebselen
AB  - Selenium is a trace element essential to human health largely because of its incorporation into selenoproteins that have a wide range of protective functions. Selenium has an ongoing history of reducing the incidence and severity of various viral infections; for example, a German study found selenium status to be significantly higher in serum samples from surviving than non-surviving COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, a significant, positive, linear association was found between the cure rate of Chinese patients with COVID-19 and regional selenium status. Moreover, the cure rate continued to rise beyond the selenium intake required to optimise selenoproteins, suggesting that selenoproteins are probably not the whole story. Nonetheless, the significantly reduced expression of a number of selenoproteins, including those involved in controlling ER stress, along with increased expression of IL-6 in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in culture suggests a potential link between reduced selenoprotein expression and COVID-19-associated inflammation. In this comprehensive review, we describe the history of selenium in viral infections and then go on to assess the potential benefits of adequate and even supra-nutritional selenium status. We discuss the indispensable function of the selenoproteins in coordinating a successful immune response and follow by reviewing cytokine excess, a key mediator of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19, and its relationship to selenium status. We comment on the fact that the synthetic redox-active selenium compound, ebselen, has been found experimentally to be a strong inhibitor of the main SARS-CoV-2 protease that enables viral maturation within the host. That finding suggests that redox-active selenium species formed at high selenium intake might hypothetically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteases. We consider the tactics that SARS-CoV-2 could employ to evade an adequate host response by interfering with the human selenoprotein system. Recognition of the myriad mechanisms by which selenium might potentially benefit COVID-19 patients provides a rationale for randomised, controlled trials of selenium supplementation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Background and aims
Initially, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was considered primarily a respiratory pathogen. However, with time it has behaved as a virus with the potential to cause multi-system involvement, including neurological manifestations. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) has increasingly been reported in association with coronavirus infectious disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we have shed light upon CVT and its possible mechanisms in the backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
In this review, data were collected from PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science, until March 30, 2021, using pre-specified searching strategies. The search strategy consisted of a variation of keywords of relevant medical subject headings and keywords, including “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “coronavirus”, and “cerebral venous sinus thrombosis”.
Results
COVID-19 has a causal association with a plethora of neurological, neuropsychiatric and psychological effects. CVT has gained particular importance in this regard. The known hypercoagulable state in SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to be the main mechanism in COVID-19 related CVT. Other plausible mechanisms may include vascular endothelial dysfunction and altered flow dynamics.
Conclusions
Although there are no specific clinical characteristics, insidious or acute onset headache, seizures, stroke-like, or encephalopathy symptoms in a patient with, or who has suffered COVID-19, should prompt the attending physician to investigate for CVT. The treatment of COVID-19 associated CVT does not differ radically from the therapy of CVT without the infection, i.e. urgent initiation of parenteral unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin followed by conventional or mostly newer oral anticoagulants.

AB  - With the upsurge in the cases of COVID-19 around the world, plenty of potential COVID-19 complications are becoming more prevalent, including a higher risk of secondary bacterial and fungal infections. Mucormycosis is one such condition which has high prevalence among individuals with diabetes who were infected with COVID-19.The usage of steroids in the treatment further inflates the risk of infection and exacerbation of disease in pre-existent mucormycosis patients. Generally, Corticosteroid-induced diabetes can arise on long-term steroid medication, increasing the likelihood of mucormycosis. In patients with COVID-19, the indications and dose of corticosteroids should be properly regulated, and persons with diabetes who take insulin or oral anti-diabetic medicines should be cautious. To avoid poor outcomes, strategies to improve glycemic management should be emphasized. This narrative review elucidates different disciplines on rampant use of steroids, iron and zinc supplements as well as the methods utilized as primary or adjunctive treatment of this fatal condition. This article may help to pave the way for robust research that needs to be done to tackle the deadly triple burden of the disease.

AB  - Objective
To identify factors that contribute to the increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 in obese children and adolescents, and its health consequences.
Sources
Studies published between 2000 and 2020 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, SciELO, and Cochrane databases.
Summary of findings
Obesity is a highly prevalent comorbidity in severe cases of COVID-19 in children and adolescents; social isolation may lead to increase fat accumulation. Excessive adipose tissue, deficit in lean mass, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and low intake of essential nutrients are factors that compromise the functioning of organs and systems in obese individuals. These factors are associated with damage to immune, cardiovascular, respiratory, and urinary systems, along with modification of the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis). In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, these organic changes from obesity may increase the need for ventilatory assistance, risk of thromboembolism, reduced glomerular filtration rate, changes in the innate and adaptive immune response, and perpetuation of the chronic inflammatory response.
Conclusions
The need for social isolation can have the effect of causing or worsening obesity and its comorbidities, and pediatricians need to be aware of this issue. Facing children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, health professionals should 1) diagnose excess weight; 2) advise on health care in times of isolation; 3) screen for comorbidities, ensuring that treatment is not interrupted; 4) measure levels of immunonutrients; 5) guide the family in understanding the specifics of the situation; and 6) refer to units qualified to care for obese children and adolescents when necessary.
Resumo
Objetivo
Identificar fatores que contribuem para o aumento da suscetibilidade e gravidade da COVID-19 em crianças e adolescentes obesos e suas consequências para a saúde.
Fontes de dados
Estudos publicados entre 2000 e 2020 nas bases de dados PubMed, Medline, Scopus, SciELO e Cochrane.
Síntese dos dados
A obesidade é uma comorbidade altamente prevalente em casos graves de COVID-19 em crianças e adolescentes e o isolamento social pode levar ao aumento do acúmulo de gordura. Tecido adiposo excessivo, déficit de massa magra, resistência à insulina, dislipidemia, hipertensão, altos níveis de citocinas pró-inflamatórias e baixa ingestão de nutrientes essenciais são fatores que comprometem o funcionamento dos órgãos e sistemas no indivíduo obeso. Esses fatores estão associados a danos nos sistemas imunológico, cardiovascular, respiratório e urinário, juntamente com a modificação da microbiota intestinal (disbiose). Na infecção por SARS-CoV-2, essas alterações orgânicas causadas pela obesidade podem aumentar a necessidade de assistência ventilatória, risco de tromboembolismo, taxa de filtração glomerular reduzida, alterações na resposta imune inata e adaptativa e perpetuação da resposta inflamatória crônica.
Conclusões
A necessidade de isolamento social pode ter o efeito de causar ou agravar a obesidade e suas comorbidades e pediatras precisam estar cientes desse problema. Diante de crianças com suspeita ou confirmação de COVID-19, os profissionais de saúde devem 1) diagnosticar o excesso de peso; 2) aconselhar sobre cuidados de saúde em tempos de isolamento; 3) fazer a triagem de comorbidades, garantindo que o tratamento não seja interrompido; 4) medir os níveis de imunonutrientes; 5) orientar a família respeitando as especificidades da situação; e 6) encaminhamento a unidades qualificadas para cuidar de crianças e adolescentes obesos, quando necessário.

This will inform therapeutic strategies that target vulnerabilities in the vital processes through which the virus enters cells. This review identifies enzymes responsible for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into cells (ACE2, Furin, TMPRSS2) and discuss compounds proposed to inhibit viral entry with the end goal of treating COVID-19 infection. We argue that TMPRSS2 inhibitors show the most promise in potentially treating COVID-19, in addition to being a pre-existing medication with fewer predicted side-effects.

AB  - Introduction
The evolving COVID-19 pandemic became a hallmark in human history, not only by changing lifestyles, but also by enriching scientific knowledge on viral infection and its consequences.
Objective
Although the management of cardiorespiratory changes is pivotal to a favorable prognosis during severe clinical findings, dysregulation of other systems caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection may imbalance erythrocyte dynamics, such as a bidirectional positive feedback loop pathophysiology.
Method and Results
Recent evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of affecting the genetics and dynamics of erythrocytes and this coexists with a non-homeostatic function of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal systems during COVID-19. In hypothesis, SARS-CoV-2-induced systematical alterations of erythrocytes dynamics would constitute a setpoint for COVID-19-related multiple organ failure syndrome and death.
Conclusion
The present review covers the most frequent erythrocyte-related non-homeostatic findings during COVID-19 capable of providing mechanistic clues of SARS-CoV-2-induced infection and inspiring therapeutic-oriented scientific evidence.

AB  - Favipiravir, a broad-spectrum RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, inhibits the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at significantly lower concentrations than the plasma trough levels achieved by the dosage adopted for influenza treatment and exhibits efficacy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Although high doses of favipiravir are required due to the molecule being a purine analog, its conversion into the active form in infected cells with active viral RNA synthesis enhances the antiviral specificity and selectivity as a chain terminator with lethal mutagenesis. Another characteristic feature is the lack of generation of favipiravir-resistant virus. COVID-19 pneumonia is caused by strong cell-mediated immunity against virus-infected cells, and the inflammatory response induced by adaptive immunity continues to peak for 3 to 5 days despite antiviral treatment. This has also been observed in herpes zoster (HZ) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia. Inflammation due to an immune response may mask the effectiveness of favipiravir against COVID-19 pneumonia. Favipiravir significantly shortened the recovery time in patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia by 3 days with the start of treatment by the 5th day of symptom onset. Since both CMV and COVID-19 pneumonia are caused by adaptive immunity and prevention of cytomegalovirus pneumonia is the standard treatment due to difficulties in treating refractory CMV pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia should be prevented with early treatment as well. In the present study, we have comprehensively reviewed the optimal antiviral therapy for COVID-19 based on clinical trials of favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia and the concurrently established therapies for other viral infections, particularly HZ and CMV pneumonia. Optimally, antivirals should be administered immediately after COVID-19 diagnosis, similar to that after influenza diagnosis, to prevent COVID-19 pneumonia and complications resulting from microangiopathy.

AB  - The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents an ongoing medical challenge, as it involves multiple organs, including the cardiovascular system. Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) has been described in the context of COVID-19 in 2 different scenarios: as a direct complication of the infection, and as an indirect outcome secondary to the psychological burden of quarantine and social isolation (ie, stress-induced cardiomyopathy). Confirming the diagnosis of TTS in COVID-19 may be challenging due to the limited use of coronary angiography consistent with the recommended guidelines aimed at minimizing contact with infected individuals. The use of natriuretic peptide as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in this context may not be reliable as this peptide is already elevated in severe cases of COVID-19 regardless of TTS diagnosis. A relatively high incidence of complications has been reported in these cases, probably related to the severity of the underlying infectious disease. Although quarantine-induced stress cardiomyopathy is an unsurprising outcome of the powerful stress resulting from the current pandemic, conflicting results have been reported, and further studies are encouraged to determine the true incidence.
Résumé
La maladie à coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) qui sévit actuellement représente un défi médical continu, car elle touche plusieurs organes, dont l'appareil cardiovasculaire. Le syndrome de Takotsubo a été décrit dans le contexte de la COVID-19 en fonction de deux scénarios différents : en tant que complication directe de l'infection et comme conséquence indirecte secondaire du fardeau psychologique imposé par la quarantaine et l'isolement social (c'est-à-dire une cardiomyopathie induite par le stress). La confirmation du diagnostic de syndrome de Takotsubo dans les cas de COVID-19 peut s'avérer difficile en raison du recours limité à la coronarographie, conformément aux recommandations visant à réduire au minimum les contacts avec les personnes infectées. L'utilisation du peptide natriurétique comme marqueur diagnostique et pronostique dans ce contexte peut ne pas être fiable, car le taux de ce peptide est déjà élevé dans les cas sévères de COVID-19, indépendamment du diagnostic de syndrome de Takotsubo. Une incidence relativement élevée de complications a été signalée dans ces cas, probablement liée à la sévérité de la maladie infectieuse sous-jacente. Bien que la cardiomyopathie de stress provoquée par la quarantaine soit un résultat peu étonnant du stress puissant associé à la pandémie actuelle, des résultats contradictoires ont été rapportés; il serait donc bon de mener des études supplémentaires pour en déterminer la véritable incidence.

AB  - ABSTRACT
The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) pandemic is responsible for more than 500,000 deaths in the United States and nearly 3 million worldwide, profoundly altering the landscape of health care delivery. Aggressive public health measures were instituted and hospital efforts became directed at COVID-19–related concerns. Consequently, routine surgical practice was virtually halted, resulting in billions of dollars in hospital losses as pandemic costs escalated. Navigating an uncertain new landscape of scarce resource allocation, exposure risk, role redeployment, and significant practice pattern changes has been challenging. Furthermore, the overall effect on the financial viability of the health care system and vascular surgical practices is yet to be elucidated. This review explores the economic and clinical implications of COVID-19 on the practice of vascular surgery in addition to the health care system as a whole.

AB  - The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly changed clinical care and research, including the conduct of clinical trials, and the clinical research ecosystem will need to adapt to this transformed environment. The Heart Failure Academic Research Consortium is a partnership between the Heart Failure Collaboratory and the Academic Research Consortium, composed of academic investigators from the United States and Europe, patients, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and industry members. A series of meetings were convened to address the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, review options for maintaining or altering best practices, and establish key recommendations for the conduct and analysis of clinical trials for cardiovascular disease and heart failure. This paper summarizes the discussions and expert consensus recommendations.

AB  - Summary
Jails and prisons are exceptionally susceptible to viral outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The USA has extremely high rates of incarceration and COVID-19 is causing an urgent health crisis in correctional facilities and detention centres. Epidemics happening in prisons are compounding the elevated risks that COVID-19 poses to people of colour, older people, and those with comorbidities. Intersectoral community re-entry efforts in the USA and other countries have shown that releasing people from correctional facilities as a pandemic-era public health intervention is safe and can support both public safety and community rebuilding. Therefore, substantial decarceration in the USA should be initiated. A point of focus for such efforts is that many people in prison are serving excessively long sentences and pose acceptable safety risks for release. Properly managed, correctional depopulation will prevent considerable COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and reduce prevailing socioeconomic and health inequities.

AB  - Thousands of studies have been conducted in order to understand in depth the characteristics of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, its infectivity and ways of transmission, and very especially everything related to the clinical and severity of the COVID-19, as well as the potential treatments. In this sense, the role that essential and toxic metals/metalloids have in the development and course of this disease is being studied. Metals/metalloids such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury or vanadium, are elements with known toxic effects in mammals, while trace elements such as cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, selenium and zinc are considered essential. Given the importance of metals/metalloids in nutrition and human health, the present review was aimed at assessing the relationship between various essential and toxic metals/metalloids and the health outcomes related with the COVID-19. We are in the position to conclude that particular attention must be paid to the load/levels of essential trace elements in COVID-19 patients, mainly zinc and selenium. On the other hand, the exposure to air pollutants in general, and toxic metal/metalloids in particular, should be avoided as much as possible to reduce the possibilities of viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a substantial stressor that is greatly impacting environmental sustainability. Besides, the different pre-existing environmental stressors and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)-related stressors are further worsening the effects of the viral disease by inducing the generation of oxidative stress. The generated oxidative stress results in nucleic acid damage associated with viral mutations, that could potentially reduce the effectiveness of COVID-19 management, including the vaccine approach. The current review is aimed to overview the impact of the oxidative stress damage induced by various environmental stressors on COVID-19. The available data regarding the COVID-19-related stressors and the effects of oxidative stress damage induced by the chronic stress, exposure to free radicals, and malnutrition are also analyzed to showcase the promising options, which could be investigated further for sustainable control of the pandemic.

AB  - The global public health crisis caused by COVID-19 has lasted longer than many of us would have hoped and expected. With its high uncertainty and limited control, the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly asked a lot from all of us. One important central question is: how resilient have we proved in face of the unprecedented and prolonged coronavirus pandemic? There is a vast and rapidly growing literature that has examined the impact of the pandemic on mental health both on the shorter (2020) and longer (2021) term. This not only concerns pandemic-related effects on resilience in the general population, but also how the pandemic has challenged stress resilience and mental health outcomes across more specific vulnerable population groups: patients with a psychiatric disorder, COVID-19 diagnosed patients, health care workers, children and adolescents, pregnant women, and elderly people. It is challenging to keep up to date with, and interpret, this rapidly increasing scientific literature. In this review, we provide a critical overview on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted mental health and how human stress resilience has been shaped by the pandemic on the shorter and longer term. The vast literature is dominated by a wealth of data which are, however, not always of the highest quality and heavily depend on online and self-report surveys. Nevertheless, it appears that we have proven surprisingly resilient over time, with fast recovery from COVID-19 measures. Still, vulnerable groups such as adolescents and health care personnel that have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic do exist. Large interindividual differences exist, and for future pandemics there is a clear need to comprehensively and integratively assess resilience from the start to provide personalized help and interventions tailored to the specific needs for vulnerable groups.

AB  - Background
The ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), as the latest threat to global health, causes overwhelming effects for the public healthcare systems worldwide. Of note, in addition to the respiratory complications, some patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) also develop serious cardiovascular injuries. Vasoactive peptides play an important role in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions.
Aim
With the urgent need for exploring the specific therapeutic targets and biomarkers for the emerging COVID-19, the general aim of this review is to discuss the potentials of the vasoactive peptides including Angiotensin II (Ang II), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), endothelin-1 (ET-1), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), natriuretic peptides, substance P (SP) and bradykinin (BK) as therapeutic targets and/or prognostic indicators for the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conclusion
Based on various observations some authors conclude that the assessment of vasoactive peptides shall be considered a routine part of COVID-19 patient monitoring, and they can serve as potential therapeutic targets for the disease management.

AB  - Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a highly pleiotropic glycoprotein factor that can modulate innate and adaptive immunity as well as various aspects of metabolism, including glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation. Recently, the expression and release of IL-6 is shown to be significantly increased in numerous diseases related to virus infection, and this increase is positively correlated with the disease severity. Immunity and metabolism are two highly integrated and interdependent systems, the balance between them plays a pivotal role in maintaining body homeostasis. IL-6-elicited inflammatory response is found to be closely associated with metabolic disorder in patients with viral infection. This brief review summarizes the regulatory role of IL-6 in immunometabolic reprogramming among seven viral infection-associated diseases.

AB  - A variety of treatment modalities have been investigated since the beginning of the Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. The use of antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine) for COVID-19 treatment and prevention has proven to be a cautionary tale for widespread, off-label use of a medication during a crisis. The investigation of antimalarials for COVID-19 has also been a driver for a deluge of scientific output in a short amount of time. In this narrative review, we detail the evidence for and against antimalarial use in COVID-19, starting with the early small observational studies that influenced strategies worldwide. We then contrast these findings to later published larger observational studies and randomized controlled trials. We detail the emerging possible cardiovascular risks associated with antimalarial use in COVID-19 and whether COVID-19-related outcomes and cardiovascular risks may differ for antimalarials used in rheumatic diseases.

AB  - COVID‐19 is frequently accompanied by a hypercoagulable inflammatory state with microangiopathic pulmonary changes that can precede the diffuse alveolar damage characteristic of typical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) seen in other severe pathogenic infections. Parallels with systemic inflammatory disorders such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) have implicated the complement pathway in the pathogenesis of COVID‐19, and particularly the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a released from cleavage of C3 and C5, respectively. C5a is a potent cell signalling protein that activates a cytokine storm—a hyper‐inflammatory phenomenon—within hours of infection and the innate immune response. However, excess C5a can result in a pro‐inflammatory environment orchestrated through a plethora of mechanisms that propagate lung injury, lymphocyte exhaustion, and an immune paresis. Furthermore, disruption of the homeostatic interactions between complement and extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways contributes to a net pro‐coagulant state in the microvasculature of critical organs. Fatal COVID‐19 has been associated with a systemic inflammatory response accompanied by a pro‐coagulant state and organ damage, particularly microvascular thrombi in the lungs and kidneys. Pathologic studies report strong evidence of complement activation. C5 blockade reduces inflammatory cytokines and their manifestations in animal studies, and has shown benefits in patients with aHUS, prompting investigation of this approach in the treatment of COVID‐19. This review describes the role of the complement pathway and particularly C5a and its aberrations in highly pathogenic virus infections, and therefore its potential as a therapeutic target in COVID‐19.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible virus with significant global impact, morbidity, and mortality. The SARS-CoV-2 virus may result in widespread organ manifestations including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, thromboembolism, and myocarditis. Virus-induced endothelial injury may cause endothelial activation, increased permeability, inflammation, and immune response and cytokine storm. Endothelial dysfunction is a systemic disorder that is a precursor of atherosclerotic vascular disease that is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and is highly prevalent in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular and peripheral disease. Several studies have associated various viral infections including SARS-CoV-2 infection with inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and subsequent innate immune response and cytokine storm. Noninvasive monitoring of endothelial function and identification of high-risk patients who may require specific therapies may have the potential to improve morbidity and mortality associated with subsequent inflammation, cytokine storm, and multiorgan involvement.

AB  - Emerging evidence has documented that multisystem organ failure in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is strongly associated with various coagulopathies. Treatments for COVID-19-associated coagulopathy are still a clinical challenge. An advancement in the knowledge of mechanisms of the excessive or inappropriate activation of the complement cascade involved in the genesis of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy might be a fundamental approach for developing novel classes of anticoagulant drugs. In this context, there is emerging evidence indicating that C5a, a component of the complement system, and its receptors (C5aRs) play a critical role in the genesis of the COVID-19-associated hypercoagulable state. Thus, this review describes the mechanisms by which C5a/C5aR signaling participates in the cascade of events involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. Furthermore, it highlights the current possibilities for the development of a novel therapeutic approach for COVID-19 patients that targets C5a/C5aRs signaling.

AB  - As the world navigates the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is a growing need to assess its impact in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Patients with SLE are a unique population when considering the risk of contracting COVID-19 and infection outcomes. The use of systemic glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants, and underlying organ damage from SLE are potential susceptibility factors. Most patients with SLE have evidence of high type I interferon activity, which may theoretically act as an antiviral line of defense or contribute to the development of a deleterious hyperinflammatory response in COVID-19. Other immunopathogenic mechanisms of SLE may overlap with those described in COVID-19, thus, studies in SLE could provide some insight into immune responses occurring in severe cases of the viral infection. We reviewed the literature to date on COVID-19 in patients with SLE and provide an in-depth review of current research in the area, including immune pathway activation, epidemiology, clinical features, outcomes, and the psychosocial impact of the pandemic in those with autoimmune disease.

AB  - Background
Diabetes has been found to be one of the leading comorbidities associated with fatality in COVID-19 patients. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry is facilitated by interaction with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) and possible polymorphisms in ACE2 can be a determining factor in host-viral protein interaction. A significant shift of healthcare towards ‘Telemedicine’ is also on the rise. In this review, the possible effects of ACE2 polymorphisms on SARS-CoV-2 entry along with the escalation of ‘telemedicine’ is discussed.
Method
An expansive literature search using keywords: “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “diabetes”, “type 2 diabetes’’, “type 1 diabetes”, “ACE2”, “polymorphism”, “DPP4” and “telemedicine” was conducted on Pubmed and EMBASE till 7th August 2020.
Result
Possible polymorphisms in ACE2 gene can play a role in influencing the virus entry in host body. Telemedicine can bring a new revolution for medical sector.
Conclusion
COVID-19 severity is more heinous among diabetic population. So far, the in-silico studies involving human ACE2-viral Spike (S) interaction showed inconsistent predictions regarding some SNPs. But without actual in-vivo studies, a holistic understanding can’t be established.

AB  - As global numbers of COVID-19 grow, chronic neurological symptoms, including those of autonomic dysfunction, are being reported with increasing frequency. Mounting evidence suggests that many patients experience chronic and sometimes debilitating symptoms long after their acute infectious period, leading to the new diagnostic category of post-acute COVID syndrome. Many symptoms of post-acute COVID syndrome appear autonomic in nature, suggesting that autonomic impairment may play a central role in the underlying pathophysiology. In this review, we discuss the autonomic symptoms and manifestations of post-acute COVID syndrome, potential mechanisms involved, and future directions for a better understanding of this novel condition.
