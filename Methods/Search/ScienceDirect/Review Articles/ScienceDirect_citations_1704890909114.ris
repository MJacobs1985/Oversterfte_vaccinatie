AB  - Majority of patients with heart failure (HF) die in either nursing homes or inpatient facilities. Social vulnerability captures multiple domains of socioeconomic position and has been linked with higher HF mortality. We sought to investigate the trends in location of death in patients with HF and its association with social vulnerability. We utilized the multiple cause of death files from the United States (1999-2021) to identify decedents with HF as the underlying cause of death and linked them with county-level social vulnerability index (SVI) available from CDC/ATSDR database. Approximately 1.7 million HF deaths were examined across 3003 United States counties. Most patients (63%) died in a nursing home or inpatient facility, followed by home (28%), and only 4% died in hospice. Death at home had a positive correlation with higher SVI with Pearson's r = 0.26 (P < 0.001) as well as deaths in an inpatient facility r = 0.33 (P < 0.001). Death in a nursing home correlated negatively with SVI with r = -0.46 (P < 0.001). There was no association between hospice utilization and SVI. Locations of death were varied by geographic residence. More patients died at home during the COVID-19 pandemic (OR 1.39, P < 0.001). Social vulnerability was associated with location of death in patients with HF in the US. These associations varied by geographic location. Future studies should focus on social determinants of health and end-of-life care in HF.

AB  - The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the current status of osteoarthritis (OA) as one of the most common joint disorders worldwide. Despite being the 11th cause of disability globally, there has been an increase in the prevalence, annual incidence, and years lived with disability of OA, particularly in developed and developing countries. Erosive hand OA, which affects approximately 10% of the general population, has been associated with a higher clinical burden compared to non-erosive hand OA. Patients with knee and hip OA, but not hand OA, are also at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Furthermore, OA has a significant contribution to healthcare costs in most countries. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the disease burden of OA patients due to limited access to medical and surgical treatment. With increasing life expectancy and the aging of the global population, the burden of OA is expected to worsen. Therefore, this review highlights the importance of improving population and policymaker awareness of risk factors, such as obesity and injury, as well as early intervention and management of OA to control the future burden of the disease.

AB  - Summary
2023 marks the 20-year anniversary of the creation of Mexico's System of Social Protection for Health and the Seguro Popular, a model for the global quest to achieve universal health coverage through health system reform. We analyse the success and challenges after 2012, the consequences of reform ageing, and the unique coincidence of systemic reorganisation during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify strategies for health system disaster preparedness. We document that population health and financial protection improved as the Seguro Popular aged, despite erosion of the budget and absent needed reforms. The Seguro Popular closed in January, 2020, and Mexico embarked on a complex, extensive health system reorganisation. We posit that dismantling the Seguro Popular while trying to establish a new programme in 2020–21 made the Mexican health system more vulnerable in the worst pandemic period and shows the precariousness of evidence-based policy making to political polarisation and populism. Reforms should be designed to be flexible yet insulated from political volatility and constructed and managed to be structurally permeable and adaptable to new evidence to face changing health needs. Simultaneously, health systems should be grounded to withstand systemic shocks of politics and natural disasters.

KW  - SARS-CoV-2
AB  - Introduction
The impact of SARS-CoV-2 in rare disease populations has been underreported. Gaucher disease (GD) is a prototype rare disease that shares with SARS-CoV-2 a disruption of the lysosomal pathway.
Materials-methods
Retrospective analysis of 11 patients with Type 1 GD who developed COVID-19 between March 2020 and March 2021.
Results
Seven male and 4 female patients with Type 1 GD developed COVID-19. One was a pediatric patient (8 years old) while the remainder were adults, median age of 44 years old (range 21 to 64 years old). Two patients required hospitalization though none required intensive care or intubation. All 11 patients recovered from COVID-19 and there were no reported deaths.
Conclusions
Our case series suggests that GD patients acquired COVID-19 at a similar frequency as the general population, though experienced a milder overall course despite harboring underlying immune system dysfunction and other known co-morbidities that confer high risk of adverse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Summary
Non-timely reporting, selective reporting, or non-reporting of clinical trial results are prevalent and serious issues. WHO mandates that summary results be available in registries within 12 months of study completion and published in full text within 24 months. However, only a limited number of clinical trials in infectious diseases, including those done during the COVID-19 pandemic, have their results posted on ClinicalTrials.gov. An analysis of 50 trials of eight antiviral drugs tested against COVID-19 with a completion date of at least 2 years ago revealed that only 18% had their results published in the registry, with 40% not publishing any results. Non-timely and non-reporting practices undermine patient participation and are ethically unacceptable. Strategies should include obligatory reporting of summary results within 12 months in clinical trial registries, with progress towards peer-reviewed publication within 24 months indicated. Timely publication of research papers should be encouraged through an automated flagging mechanism in clinical trial registries that draws attention to the status of results reporting, such as a green tick for trials that have reported summary results within 12 months and a red tick in case of failure to do so. We propose the inclusion of mandatory clinical trial reporting standards in the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines, which should prohibit sponsor contract clauses that restrict reporting (referred to as gag clauses) and require timely reporting of results as part of the ethics committees' clearance process for clinical trial protocols.

AB  - Chronic lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and the recently emerged COVID-19, are a huge threat to human health, and among the leading causes of global morbidity and mortality every year. Despite availability of various conventional therapeutics, many patients remain poorly controlled and have a poor quality of life. Furthermore, the treatment and diagnosis of these diseases are becoming increasingly challenging. In the recent years, the application of nanomedicine has become increasingly popular as a novel strategy for diagnosis, treatment, prevention, as well as follow-up of chronic lung diseases. This is attributed to the ability of nanoscale drug carriers to achieve targeted delivery of therapeutic moieties with specificity to diseased site within the lung, thereby enhancing therapeutic outcomes of conventional therapies whilst minimizing the risks of adverse reactions. For this instance, monoolein is a polar lipid nanomaterial best known for its versatility, thermodynamic stability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. As such, it is commonly employed in liquid crystalline systems for various drug delivery applications. In this review, we present the applications of monoolein as a novel nanomaterial-based strategy for targeted drug delivery with the potential to revolutionize therapeutic approaches in chronic lung diseases.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected communities, populations, and countries throughout the world. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic developed, the extent to which the disease interacted with already existing endemic, non-communicable and infectious diseases became evident, hence deeply influencing health outcomes. Additionally, a synergistic effect has been demonstrated also with socio-economic, cultural, and contextual determinants of health which seem to contribute to poorer health and accumulating social disadvantages. In this essay, using as a starting point the syndemic theory that translates the cumulative and intertwined factors between different epidemics, we argue that the SARS-CoV-2 is a one health issue of a syndemic nature and that the failure to acknowledge this contributes to weakened policy-making processes and public health responses and ineffective health policies and programs.

AB  - Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with multi-systemic derangement, including circulatory dysfunction with features of endothelial dysfunction, microangiopathic thrombosis and angiocentric inflammation. Recently, intussusceptive angiogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Herein, we conducted a narrative review according to the SANRA guidelines to review and discuss data regarding splitting angiogenesis including mechanisms, drivers, regulators and putative roles. Relevant angiogenic features in Covid-19, including their potential role in inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and permeability, as well as their use as prognostic markers and therapeutic roles are reviewed. Splitting angiogenesis in Covid-19 involve hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factors, classic angiogenic mediators, such as the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Angiopoietins, hyperinflammation and cytokine storm, and dysregulation of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System, which combined, interact to promote intussusception. Data regarding the use of angiogenic mediators as prognostic tools is summarized and suggest that angiopoietins and VEGF are elevated in Covid-19 patients and predictors of adverse outcomes. Finally, we reviewed the scarce data regarding angiogenic mediators as therapeutic targets. These preliminary findings suggest a potential benefit of bevacizumab as an add-on therapy.

A multi-database literature search from January to December of 2022 was undertaken. Original research articles, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and guidelines were included. Abstracts, case reports, letters, protocols, pediatric and obstetric articles, and cardiac surgery literature were excluded. Two authors reviewed each reference using the Distiller SR systematic review software (Evidence Partners Inc., Ottawa, Ont, Canada). A modified Delphi technique was used to identify 8 practice-changing articles. We identified another 10 articles for tabular summaries. We highlight why these articles have the potential to change clinical perioperative practice and areas where more information is needed.

AB  - We present here a new selection criterion for prioritizing research on efficacious drugs for the fight against COVID-19: the relative toxicity versus safety of herbal medications, which were effective against SARS in the 2002/2003 epidemic. We rank these medicines according to their toxicity versus safety as basis for preferential rapid research on their potential in the treatment of COVID-19. The data demonstrate that from toxicological information nothing speaks against immediate investigation on, followed by rapid implementation of Lonicera japonica, Morus alba, Forsythia suspensa, and Codonopsis spec. for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Glycyrrhiza spec. and Panax ginseng are ranked in second priority and ephedrine-free Herba Ephedrae extract in third priority (followed by several drugs in lower preferences). Rapid research on their efficacy in the therapy - as well as safety under the specific circumstances of COVID-19 - followed by equally rapid implementation will provide substantial advantages to Public Health including immediate availability, enlargement of medicinal possibilities, in cases where other means are not successful (non-responders), not tolerated (sensitive individuals) or just not available (as is presently the case) and thus minimize sufferings and save lives. Moreover, their moderate costs and convenient oral application are especially advantageous for underprivileged populations in developing countries.

AB  - Summary
This review focused on compiling, summarizing, updating the information available on the colostrum and its health benefits. Colostrum is the first milk secreted by the mammary gland of female mammals immediately after birth during the first few days, and its composition differs from the mature milk. It ensures immune support for newborns in the early stages of life. It is a divine immune gift from the Creator. Mammalian colostrum contains unique components rich in nutritional macronutrients (proteins, fat, carbohydrates) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, antioxidants) and many bioactive substances like antimicrobial factors (Igs, LF, LP, LZ, cytokines) and growth factors (EGF, TGFα and β, IGF-1 and 2, FGF, PDGF, GH), which are necessary to stimulate the immune systems that newborns need for health and survival life. Physicochemical composition changes dramatically in the first few days that distinguish it from mature milk. This reverses an essential difference in their biological function as fractional sources or for health-promotion. So it is considered one of the best natural food supplements consumed within various life stages. Colostrum is used to treat cancer, AIDS, polio, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Hyper-immune colostrum or milk collected from cows immunized by SARS-CoV-2, it can grant protection short-term from infection in humans and can be used as an alternative way to produce specific antibodies against CoVID-19 until effective excess vaccines against new mutations can be available. Likewise, colostrum and its components contribute as a non-drug alternative to the clinical management of CoVID-19. Also, lactoferrin and its supplements are effective in preventing and treating people with coronavirus infection. Therefore, due to these previous multiple functions, colostrum is considered as a natural food, called miracle immune milk, and used as a medicine.

AB  - Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, exhibit various clinical manifestations and severity including respiratory and enteric involvements. One of the main reasons for death among covid-19 patients is excessive immune responses directed toward cytokine storm with a low chance of recovery. Since the balanced gut microbiota could prepare health benefits by protecting against pathogens and regulating immune homeostasis, dysbiosis or disruption of gut microbiota could promote severe complications including autoimmune disorders; we surveyed the association between the imbalanced gut bacteria and the development of cytokine storm among COVID-19 patients, also the impact of probiotics and bacteriophages on the gut bacteria community to alleviate cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. In present review, we will scrutinize the mechanism of immunological signaling pathways which may trigger a cytokine storm in SARS-CoV2 infections. Moreover, we are explaining in detail the possible immunological signaling pathway-directing by the gut bacterial community. Consequently, the specific manipulation of gut bacteria by using probiotics and bacteriophages for alleviation of the cytokine storm will be investigated. The tripartite mutualistic cooperation of gut bacteria, probiotics, and phages as a candidate prophylactic or therapeutic approach in SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm episodes will be discussed at last.

AB  - Vaccines developed in high-income countries have been enormously successful in reducing the global burden of infectious diseases, saving perhaps 2.5 million lives per year, but even for successful cases, like the rotavirus vaccine, global implementation may take a decade or more. For unincentivized vaccines, the delays are even more profound, as both the supply of a vaccine from developing country manufacturers and vaccine demand from countries with the high disease burdens have to be generated in order for impact to be manifest. A number of poverty-associated infectious diseases, whose burden is greatest in low-income and middle-income countries, would benefit from appropriate levels of support for vaccine development such as Group A Streptococcus, invasive non-typhoid salmonella, schistosomiasis, shigella, to name a few. With COVID-19 vaccines we will hopefully be able to provide novel vaccine technology to all countries through a unique collaborative effort, the COVAX facility, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), Gavi, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Whether this effort can deliver vaccine to all its participating countries remains to be seen, but this ambitious effort to develop, manufacture, distribute, and vaccinate 60–80% of the world’s population will hopefully be a lasting legacy of COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
Type 1 diabetes is on the rise globally; however, the burden of mortality remains disproportionate in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). As 2021 marks 100 years since the discovery of insulin, we revisit progress, global burden of type 1 diabetes trends, and understanding of the pathogenesis and management practices related to the disease. Despite much progress, inequities in access and availability of insulin formulations persist and are reflected in differences in survival and morbidity patterns related to the disease. Some of these inequities have also been exacerbated by health-system challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a clear opportunity to improve access to insulin and related essential technologies for improved management of type 1 diabetes in LMICs, especially as a part of universal health coverage. These improvements will require concerted action and investments in human resources, community engagement, and education for the timely diagnosis and management of type 1 diabetes, as well as adequate health-care financing. Further research in LMICs, especially those in Africa, is needed to improve our understanding of the burden, risk factors, and implementation strategies for managing type 1 diabetes.

AB  - In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Since then, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern due to a growing number of deaths around the globe, as well as unparalleled economic and sociodemographic consequences. The disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel form of human coronavirus. Although coronavirus infections have been associated with neurological manifestations such as febrile seizures, convulsions, change in mental status, and encephalitis, less is known about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain. Recently, emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with neurological alterations in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical manifestations. The molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in this process, as well as the neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties of SARS-CoV-2, are still poorly understood. Glial cells, such as astrocytes and microglia, play pivotal roles in the brain response to neuroinflammatory insults and neurodegenerative diseases. Further, accumulating evidence has shown that those cells are targets of several neurotropic viruses that severely impact their function. Glial cell dysfunctions have been associated with several neuroinflammatory diseases, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 likely has a primary effect on these cells in addition to a secondary effect from neuronal damage. Here, we provide an overview of these data and discuss the possible implications of glial cells as targets of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the roles of microglia and astrocytes in brain inflammatory responses, we shed light on glial cells as possible drivers and potential targets of therapeutic strategies against neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19. The main goal of this review is to highlight the need to consider glial involvement in the progression of COVID-19 and potentially include astrocytes and microglia as mediators of SARS-CoV-2-induced neurological damage.

AB  - The intensity and frequency of wildfires is increasing globally. The systematic review of the current evidence on long-term impacts of non-occupational wildfire exposure on human health has not been performed yet. To provide a systematic review and identify potential knowledge gaps in the current evidence of long-term impacts of non-occupational exposure to wildfire smoke and/or wildfire impacts on human health. We conducted a systematic search of the literature via MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus from the database inception to July 05, 2022. References from the included studies and relevant reviews were also considered. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and a validated quality assessment framework were used to evaluate the quality of observational studies. Study results were synthesized descriptively. A total of 36 studies were included in our systematic review. Most studies were from developed countries (11 in Australia, 9 in Canada, 7 in the United States). Studies predominantly focused on mental health (21 studies, 58.33%), while evidence on long-term impacts of wildfire exposure on health outcomes other than mental health is limited. Current evidence indicated that long-term impacts of non-occupational wildfire exposure were associated with mortality (COVID-19 mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality and acute myocardial disease mortality), morbidity (mainly respiratory diseases), mental health disorders (mainly posttraumatic stress disorder), shorter height of children, reduced lung function and poorer general health status. However, no significant associations were observed for long-term impacts of wildfire exposure on child mortality and respiratory hospitalizations. The population-based high-quality evidence with quantitative analysis on this topic is still limited. Future well-designed studies considering extensive wildfire smoke air pollutants (e.g., particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen oxides) and estimating risk coefficient values for extensive health outcomes (e.g., mortality, morbidity) are warranted to fill current knowledge gaps.

AB  - The pandemic of COVID-19 challenges the global health system and raises our concerns on the next waves of other emerging infectious diseases. Considering the lessons from the failure of world's pandemic warning system against COVID-19, many scientists and politicians have mentioned different strategies to improve global biodefense system, among which Sheet, Surveillance, Strategy, Salvage and Shield (5S) are frequently discussed. Nevertheless, the current focus is mainly on the optimization and management of individual strategy, and there are limited attempts to combine the five strategies as an integral global biodefense system. Sheet represents the biosafety datasheet for biohazards in natural environment and human society, which helps our deeper understanding on the geographical pattern, transmission routes and infection mechanism of pathogens. Online surveillance and prognostication network is an environmental Surveillance tool for monitoring the outbreak of pandemic diseases and alarming the risks to take emergency actions, targeting aerosols, waters, soils and animals. Strategy is policies and legislations for social distancing, lockdown and personal protective equipment to block the spread of infectious diseases in communities. Clinical measures are Salvage on patients by innovating appropriate medicines and therapies. The ultimate defensive Shield is vaccine development to protect healthy crowds from infection. Fighting against COVID-19 and other emerging infectious diseases is a long rocky journey, requiring the common endeavors of scientists and politicians from all countries around the world. 5S in global biodefense system bring a ray of light to the current darkest and future road from environmental and geographical perspectives.

AB  - Summary
Small newborns are vulnerable to mortality and lifelong loss of human capital. Measures of vulnerability previously focused on liveborn low-birthweight (LBW) babies, yet LBW reduction targets are off-track. There are two pathways to LBW, preterm birth and fetal growth restriction (FGR), with the FGR pathway resulting in the baby being small for gestational age (SGA). Data on LBW babies are available from 158 (81%) of 194 WHO member states and the occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem, with 113 (58%) having national administrative data, whereas data on preterm births are available from 103 (53%) of 195 countries and areas, with only 64 (33%) providing national administrative data. National administrative data on SGA are available for only eight countries. Global estimates for 2020 suggest 13·4 million livebirths were preterm, with rates over the past decade remaining static, and 23·4 million were SGA. In this Series paper, we estimated prevalence in 2020 for three mutually exclusive types of small vulnerable newborns (SVNs; preterm non-SGA, term SGA, and preterm SGA) using individual-level data (2010–20) from 23 national datasets (∼110 million livebirths) and 31 studies in 18 countries (∼0·4 million livebirths). We found 11·9 million (50% credible interval [Crl] 9·1–12·2 million; 8·8%, 50% Crl 6·8–9·0%) of global livebirths were preterm non-SGA, 21·9 million (50% Crl 20·1–25·5 million; 16·3%, 14·9–18·9%) were term SGA, and 1·5 million (50% Crl 1·2–4·2 million; 1·1%, 50% Crl 0·9–3·1%) were preterm SGA. Over half (55·3%) of the 2·4 million neonatal deaths worldwide in 2020 were attributed to one of the SVN types, of which 73·4% were preterm and the remainder were term SGA. Analyses from 12 of the 23 countries with national data (0·6 million stillbirths at ≥22 weeks gestation) showed around 74% of stillbirths were preterm, including 16·0% preterm SGA and approximately one-fifth of term stillbirths were SGA. There are an estimated 1·9 million stillbirths per year associated with similar vulnerability pathways; hence integrating stillbirths to burden assessments and relevant indicators is crucial. Data can be improved by counting, weighing, and assessing the gestational age of every newborn, whether liveborn or stillborn, and classifying small newborns by the three vulnerability types. The use of these more specific types could accelerate prevention and help target care for the most vulnerable babies.

AB  - The outbreak of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly become a public health emergency of international concern, especially affecting the elderly people and patients with chronic disease, such as hypertension and respiratory syndromes. Patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment (e.g., bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, monoclonal antibodies, and paclitaxel therapy) are vulnerable to the development of respiratory syndromes induced by chemotherapeutic agents and are also more susceptible to viral infections as they are immunosuppressed. Neutropenia is an important risk factor for increased vulnerability to infections, as a respiratory syndrome involves an array of immune cells maintaining the balance between pathogen clearance and immunopathology. However, the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms in cancer patients is broad, with complications being related to the malignancy itself, treatment toxicity, and infections. The risk factors depend on the specific type of cancer, chemotherapy, patient characteristics, and comorbidities. Thus, this review discusses the main events implicated in immunosuppression caused by chemotherapy and radiation therapy and the association of immunosuppression and other factors with SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility in cancer patients; and, importantly, how to deal with this situation in face of the current pandemic scenario.

AB  - Summary
The demographics of the UK population are changing and so is the need for health care. In this Health Policy, we explore the current health of the population, the changing health needs, and future threats to health. Relative to other high-income countries, the UK is lagging on many health outcomes, such as life expectancy and infant mortality, and there is a growing burden of mental illness. Successes exist, such as the striking improvements in oral health, but inequalities in health persist as well. The growth of the ageing population relative to the working-age population, the rise of multimorbidity, and persistent health inequalities, particularly for preventable illness, are all issues that the National Health Service (NHS) will face in the years to come. Meeting the challenges of the future will require an increased focus on health promotion and disease prevention, involving a more concerted effort to understand and tackle the multiple social, environmental, and economic factors that lie at the heart of health inequalities. The immediate priority of the NHS will be to mitigate the wider and long-term health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it must also strengthen its resilience to reduce the impact of other threats to health, such as the UK leaving the EU, climate change, and antimicrobial resistance.

AB  - Pneumonia is a common lung infection that causes significant mortality and morbidity worldwide, particularly in children and elderly individuals. The diagnosis is confirmed by radiographic evidence of new consolidation. Pneumonia can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, with the dominant pathogens varying across the globe and between community- or hospital-acquired infections. Bacterial causes are usually acquired by microaspiration of organisms colonizing the nasopharynx. Microbes reaching the distal airways and alveoli induce local and systemic inflammatory responses and can disseminate beyond the lung. Although most cases of pneumonia occur in the community, a significant subset develop in hospital, often caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, which are associated with higher mortality. Microbiological investigations are required to identify the pathogenic organism but lack sensitivity. Severity scoring systems can be used to predict outcome and identify patients who can be safely managed in outpatient settings. The mainstay of treatment is early antibiotics and, if appropriate, supportive therapies such as oxygen and intravenous fluids. Large vaccination programmes have proven effective in reducing the incidence of some of the causative organisms; however, the overall incidence of pneumonia remains high, and further research is required to improve care in at-risk groups such as the elderly.

AB  - Summary
Although the development and clinical application of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated unprecedented vaccine success in a short time frame, it also revealed a limitation of current vaccines in their inability to provide broad-spectrum or universal protection against emerging variants. Broad-spectrum vaccines, therefore, remain a dream and challenge for vaccinology. This review will focus on current and future efforts in developing universal vaccines targeting different viruses at the genus and/or family levels, with a special focus on henipaviruses, influenza viruses, and coronaviruses. It is evident that strategies for developing broad-spectrum vaccines will be virus-genus or family specific, and it is almost impossible to adopt a universal approach for different viruses. On the other hand, efforts in developing broad-spectrum neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been more successful and it is worth considering broad-spectrum antibody-mediated immunization, or “universal antibody vaccine,” as an alternative approach for early intervention for future disease X outbreaks.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the rapidly spreading pandemic COVID-19 in the world. As an effective therapeutic strategy is not introduced yet and the rapid genetic variations in the virus, there is an emerging necessity to design, evaluate and apply effective new vaccines. An acceptable vaccine must elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses, must have the least side effects and the storage and transport systems should be available and affordable for all countries. These vaccines can be classified into different types: inactivated vaccines, live-attenuated virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA and RNA) and recombinant vector-based vaccines (replicating and non-replicating viral vector). According to the latest update of the WHO report on April 2nd, 2021, at least 85 vaccine candidates were being studied in clinical trial phases and 184 candidate vaccines were being evaluated in pre-clinical stages. In addition, studies have shown that other vaccines, including the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine and the Plant-derived vaccine, may play a role in controlling pandemic COVID-19. Herein, we reviewed the different types of COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are currently being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trial phases along with advantages, disadvantages or adverse reactions, if any.

AB  - The global effort to combat and contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the recently discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now proceeding on a war footing. The world was slow to react to the developing crisis, but once the contours of the impending calamity became evident, the different state and non-state actors have raced to put their act together. The COVID-19 pandemic has blatantly exposed the shortcomings of our healthcare system and the limitations of medical science, despite considerable advances in recent years. To effectively tackle the current pandemic, almost unprecedented in the modern age, there is an urgent need for a concerted, sustained, and coordinated effort towards the development of new diagnostics, therapeutic and vaccines, and the ramping up of the healthcare infrastructure, especially in the poorer underprivileged nations. Towards this end, researchers around the world are working tirelessly to develop new diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. Efforts to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 are presently underway in several countries around the world, but a new vaccine is expected only by the end of the year-at the earliest. New drug development against COVID-19 and its approval may take even longer. Under such circumstances, drug repurposing has emerged as a realistic and effective strategy to counter the current menace, and several antiviral and antimalarial medicines are currently in different stages of clinical trials. Researchers are also experimenting with nutrients, vitamins, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma as immunity boosters against the SARS-CoV-2. This report presents a critical analysis of the global clinical trial landscape for COVID-19 with an emphasis on the therapeutic agents and vaccines currently being tested at pandemic speed.

AB  - Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been associated with severe disease outcomes in several viral infections, including respiratory infections. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that antibody-response to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV could exacerbate infection via ADE. Recently in SARS CoV-2, the in vitro studies and structural analysis shows a risk of disease severity via ADE. This phenomenon is partially attributed to non-neutralizing antibodies or antibodies at sub-neutralizing levels. These antibodies result in antigen-antibody complexes' deposition and propagation of a chronic inflammatory process that destroys affected tissues. Further, antigen-antibody complexes may enhance the internalization of the virus into cells through the Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) and lead to further virus replication. Thus, ADE occur via two mechanisms; 1. Antibody mediated replication and 2. Enhanced immune activation. Antibody-mediated effector functions are mainly driven by complement activation, and the first complement in the cascade is complement 1q (C1q) which binds to the virus-antibody complex. Reports say that deficiency in circulating plasma levels of C1q, an independent predictor of mortality in high-risk patients, including diabetes, is associated with severe viral infections. Complement mediated ADE is reported in several viral infections such as dengue, West Nile virus, measles, RSV, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Ebola virus. This review discusses ADE in viral infections and the in vitro evidence of ADE in coronaviruses. We outline the mechanisms of ADE, emphasizing the role of complements, especially C1q in the outcome of the enhanced disease.

AB  - Troponin I and T as cardiac-specific biomarkers are highly useful tools not only in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes but also as independent predictors of several other clinical conditions. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays allow the detection of considerably low concentrations of cardiac troponin in apparently healthy and asymptomatic individuals, being a candidate tool for cardiovascular risk stratification in the general population. A group of Greek experts summarized the bulk of evidence regarding the use of hs-cTnI as a predictor of cardiovascular events and mortality in apparently healthy individuals and its additive value on top of existing risk stratification methods. This document could serve as a guide for the incorporation of hs-cTnI as an additional risk stratification tool in cardiovascular prevention strategies in apparently healthy individuals.

AB  - The Earth was highly radioactive four billion years ago when life emerged. Even today, all humans are bombarded by 20,000 radiation strikes each second. Although high radiation doses are hazardous, organisms have evolved not only to tolerate lower-dose radiation but also to benefit by it (hormesis). Hormesis is prevailing in all species in various respects. An example is that hibakusha (Japanese A-bomb survivors) have longer lifespans and have lower risk of cancer, on average. Many microbes thrive in deep subsurface regions by consuming radiation as a source of nutrition. Low-dose radiation (LDR) is effective at treating severely affected COVID-19 patients, but the invalid linear no-threshold model (LNT) hinders the full beneficial use of LDR.

AB  - COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, can elites severe acute respiratory syndrome, severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and even death and became a worldwide pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in cardiac injury via several mechanisms, including the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and leading to a cytokine storm, can elicit an exaggerated host immune response. This response contributes to multi-organ dysfunction. As an emerging infectious disease, there are limited data on the effects of this infection on patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities. In this review, we summarize the early-stage clinical experiences with COVID-19, with particular focus on patients with cardiovascular diseases and cardiopulmonary injuries, and explores potential available evidence regarding the association between COVID-19, and cardiovascular complications.

AB  - Objective
The COVID-19 pandemic is still spreading worldwide two years after its outbreak. Depression has been reported in around 30% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. We aim to synthesize the available meta-analytical evidence in an umbrella review exploring the prevalence of depression during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods
First, we performed a narrative umbrella review including only meta-analyses providing a quantitative summary of the prevalence of depression during or after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Then we extracted the prevalence and sample size from the original studies included in each meta-analysis, and after removing duplicate studies, we performed a random-effects model meta-analysis based on single original study estimates. Heterogeneity, publication bias, leave-one-out sensitivity, and subgroup analyses were performed.
Results
14 meta-analyses were included in the umbrella review. The prevalence of depression ranged from 12% to 55% in the presence of high heterogeneity. The meta-analysis based on 85 original studies derived from the included 14 meta-analyses showed a pooled prevalence of depression of 31% (95% CI:25–38%) in the presence of high and significant heterogeneity (Q = 8988; p < 10−6; I2 = 99%) and publication bias (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
The burden of post-COVID depression substantially exceeds the pre-pandemic prevalence. Health care services for COVID-19 survivors should monitor and treat emergent depression, reducing its potential detrimental long-term effects.

AB  - Patients with cancer have a well-known and higher risk of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). VPDs may cause severe complications in this setting due to immune system impairment, malnutrition and oncological treatments. Despite this evidence, vaccination rates are inadequate. The Italian Association of Medical Oncology [Associazione Italiana di Oncologia Medica (AIOM)] has been involved in vaccination awareness since 2014. Based on a careful review of the available data about the immunogenicity, effectiveness and safety of flu, pneumococcal and anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, we report the recommendations of the AIOM about these vaccinations in adult patients with solid tumors. The AIOM recommends comprehensive education on the issue of VPDs. We believe that a multidisciplinary care model may improve the vaccination coverage in immunocompromised patients. Continued surveillance, implementation of preventive practices and future well-designed immunological prospective studies are essential for better management of our patients with cancer.

Climate change poses significant threats to human health, propelling Japan to take decisive action through the Climate Change Adaptation Act of 2018. This Act has led to the implementation of climate change adaptation policies across various sectors, including healthcare. In this review, we synthesized existing scientific evidence on the impacts of climate change on health in Japan and outlined the adaptation strategies and measures implemented by the central and local governments. The country has prioritized tackling heat-related illness and mortality and undertaken various adaptation measures to mitigate these risks. However, it faces unique challenges due to its super-aged society. Ensuring effective and coordinated strategies to address the growing uncertainties in vulnerability to climate change and the complex intersectoral impacts of disasters remains a critical issue. To combat the additional health risks by climate change, a comprehensive approach embracing adaptation and mitigation policies in the health sector is crucial. Encouraging intersectoral communication and collaboration will be vital for developing coherent and effective strategies to safeguard public health in the face of climate change.

AB  - Summary
Despite being globally pervasive, racism, xenophobia, and discrimination are not universally recognised determinants of health. We challenge widespread beliefs related to the inevitability of increased mortality and morbidity associated with particular ethnicities and minoritised groups. In refuting that racial categories have a genetic basis and acknowledging that socioeconomic factors offer incomplete explanations in understanding these health disparities, we examine the pathways by which discrimination based on caste, ethnicity, Indigeneity, migratory status, race, religion, and skin colour affect health. Discrimination based on these categories, although having many unique historical and cultural contexts, operates in the same way, with overlapping pathways and health effects. We synthesise how such discrimination affects health systems, spatial determination, and communities, and how these processes manifest at the individual level, across the life course, and intergenerationally. We explore how individuals respond to and internalise these complex mechanisms psychologically, behaviourally, and physiologically. The evidence shows that racism, xenophobia, and discrimination affect a range of health outcomes across all ages around the world, and remain embedded within the universal challenges we face, from COVID-19 to the climate emergency.

AB  - Background
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are among several experimental treatments being investigated in the urgent response to the coronavirus disease-2019. With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs' neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications. Objective: Clarify evidence base regarding the psychiatric side effects and psychiatric drug interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
Methods
A literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950 to 2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
Results
First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels. Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents. Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of “psychosis after chloroquine.” Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports. Weak evidence suggests a possible association of hydroxychloroquine exposure and increased suicidal ideation. It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications; however, overdose of these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality.
Conclusion
The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for coronavirus disease-2019 treatment is not known. Best practice may include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for coronavirus disease-2019, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.

AB  - During aging the immune system (IS) undergoes remarkable changes that collectively are known as immunosenescence. It is a multifactorial and dynamic phenomenon that affects both natural and acquired immunity and plays a critical role in most chronic diseases in older people. For a long time, immunosenescence has been considered detrimental because it may lead to a low-grade, sterile chronic inflammation we proposed to call "inflammaging" and a progressive reduction in the ability to trigger effective antibody and cellular responses against infections and vaccinations. Recently, many scientists revised this negative meaning because it can be considered an essential adaptation/remodeling resulting from the lifelong immunological biography of single individuals from an evolutionary perspective. Inflammaging can be considered an adaptive process because it can trigger an anti-inflammatory response to counteract the age-related pro-inflammatory environment. Centenarians represent a valuable model to study the beneficial changes occurring in the IS with age. These extraordinary individuals reached the extreme limits of human life by slowing down the aging process and, in most cases, delaying, avoiding or surviving the major age-associated diseases. They indeed show a complex and heterogeneous phenotype determined by an improved ability to adapt and remodel in response to harmful stimuli. This review aims to point out the intimate relationship between immunosenescence and inflammaging and how these processes impact unsuccessful aging rather than longevity. We also describe the gut microbiota age-related changes as one of the significant triggers of inflammaging and the sex/gender differences in the immune system of the elderly, contributing to the sex/gender disparity in terms of epidemiology, pathophysiology, symptoms and severity of age-related diseases. Finally, we discuss how these phenomena could influence the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Background
SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by binding of its spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been reported to increase ACE2 expression in animal models, and worse outcomes are reported in patients with co-morbidities commonly treated with these agents, leading to controversy during the COVID-19 pandemic over whether these drugs might be helpful or harmful.
Methods
: Animal, in vitro and clinical data relevant to the biology of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), its interaction with the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) and SARS-CoV-2, and clinical studies were reviewed.
Findings and Interpretation
SARS-CoV-2 hijacks ACE2to invade and damage cells, downregulating ACE2, reducing its protective effects and exacerbating injurious Ang II effects. However, retrospective observational studies do not show higher risk of infection with ACEI or ARB use. Nevertheless, study of the RAS and KKS in the setting of coronaviral infection may yield therapeutic targets.

AB  - Rare cases of unusual thrombosis and thrombocytopenia after administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca) have been reported. The unusual symptoms are called vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). In the present study, a brief background about cases of unusual thrombosis and thrombocytopenia after administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was provided. In addition, a description of a case of a 66-year-old woman who had received this vaccine and developed VITT was done. She presented to the hospital complaining of hematomas in the right upper limb 14 days after the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, without a history of trauma (Glasgow coma scale of 14) and thrombocytopenia even though signs of thrombosis were absent. Cranium computed tomography scan indicated intraparenchymal hematoma and cerebral thrombosis, besides anastomotic Labbé vein thrombosis. The woman received platelets transfusion, dexamethasone, and neuroprotection measures, but even so, on the twelfth postoperative day, she died of cerebral rebleeding. In conclusion, it is crucial to point out the immuno-hypersensitivity mechanisms associated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine reactions, helping to reduce their occurrences and reinforcing confidence in vaccine administration.

AB  - In 2019, the world faced a serious health challenge, the rapid spreading of a life-threatening viral pneumonia, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of January 2022 WHO statistics shows more than 5.6 million death and about 350 million infection by SARS-CoV-2. One of the life threatening aspects of COVID-19 is secondary infections and reduced efficacy of antibiotics against them. Since the beginning of COVID-19 many researches have been done on identification, treatment, and vaccine development. Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) could offer novel approaches to detect, treat and control COVID-19. Phage therapy and in particular using phage cocktails can be used to control or eliminate the bacterial pathogen as an alternative or complementary therapeutic agent. At the same time, phage interaction with the host immune system can regulate the inflammatory response. In addition, phage display and engineered synthetic phages can be utilized to develop new vaccines and antibodies, stimulate the immune system, and elicit a rapid and well-appropriate defense response. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 new variants like delta and omicron has proved the urgent need for precise, efficient and novel approaches for vaccine development and virus detection techniques in which bacteriophages may be one of the plausible solutions. Therefore, phages with similar morphology and/or genetic content to that of coronaviruses can be used for ecological and epidemiological modeling of SARS-CoV-2 behavior and future generations of coronavirus, and in general new viral pathogens. This article is a comprehensive review/perspective of potential applications of bacteriophages in the fight against the present pandemic and the post-COVID era.

AB  - In the past 20 years, infections caused by coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have posed a threat to public health since they may cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans. The Complement System is activated during viral infection, being a central protagonist of innate and acquired immunity. Here, we report some interactions between these three coronaviruses and the Complement System, highlighting the central role of C3 with the severity of these infections. Although it can be protective, its role during coronavirus infections seems to be contradictory. For example, during SARS-CoV-2 infection, Complement System can control the viral infection in asymptomatic or mild cases; however, it can also intensify local and systemic damage in some of severe COVID-19 patients, due to its potent proinflammatory effect. In this last condition, the activation of the Complement System also amplifies the cytokine storm and the pathogenicity of coronavirus infection. Experimental treatment with Complement inhibitors has been an enthusiastic field of intense investigation in search of a promising additional therapy in severe COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is difficult to treat and is associated with a high mortality rate. The most severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also leads to life-threatening ARDS. Neutrophil counts are positively correlated with disease severity in ARDS. Neutrophil activation not only plays a significant role in immune defense against infections, but also causes tissue damage and leads to inflammatory diseases. Activated neutrophils rapidly migrate to inflamed lung tissue, releasing toxic granular contents and generating neutrophil extracellular traps. In the last few decades, it has become apparent that neutrophils occupy a central role in ARDS pathology. In this review, we summarize the neutrophil inflammatory responses and their relationships to ARDS. According to the current literature, understanding the function of neutrophils may be helpful in the treatment of ARDS.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has negatively impacted on patients of the whole CKD spectrum, causing high rates of morbi-mortality. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines opened a new era, but patients with CKD (including kidney transplant, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) were systematically excluded from pivotal clinical trials. The Spanish Society of Nephrology promoted the multicentric national SENCOVAC study aimed at assessing immunological responses after vaccination in patients with CKD. During the first year after vaccination, patients with non-dialysis CKD and those on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis presented good anti-Spike antibody responses to vaccination, especially after receiving the third and fourth doses. However, kidney transplant recipients presented suboptimal responses after any vaccination schedule (initial, third and fourth dose). Especially worrisome is the situation of a patients with a persistently negative humoral response that do not seroconvert after boosters. In this regard, monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 have been approved for high-risk patients, although they may become obsolete as the viral genome evolves. The present report reviews the current status of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the CKD spectrum with emphasis on lessons learned from the SENCOVAC study. Predictors of humoral response, including vaccination schedules and types of vaccines, as well as the integration of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antiviral agents are discussed.
Resumen
Síndrome agudo respiratorio severo coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ha impactado negativamente en todos los pacientes con enfermedad renal crónica (ERC), causando elevadas tasas de morbimortalidad. La vacunación frente a SARS-CoV-2 han abierto una nueva era, aunque precisamente los pacientes con ERC (incluyendo los portadores de un injerto renal y aquellos en programas de hemodiálisis y diálisis peritoneal) han sido sistemáticamente excluidos de los ensayos clínicos. La Sociedad Española de Nefrología (S.E.N.) promovió el estudio multicéntrico SENCOVAC para evaluar la respuesta inmunológica tras la vacunación en todo el espectro de la ERC. Un año después de haber recibido la pauta inicial de vacunación, los pacientes con ERC sin necesidad de diálisis, y aquellos en hemodiálisis y diálisis peritoneal, han presenado una adecuada respuesta humoral (monitorizada con el desarrollo de anticuerpos frente a la proteína Spike), especialmente después de recibir la tercera y la cuarta dosis. Sin embargo, los portadores de un injerto renal han presentado una constante respuesta subóptima en cualquier momento de la vacunación (dosis inicial, tercera y cuarta dosis). Especialmente preocupante es la situación de los pacientes con respuesta humoral persistentemente negativa que no seroconvierten incluso ni tras recibir las dosis de recuerdo o boosters. En ese contexto, el manejo probablemente pasa por el uso de anticuerpos monoclonales dirigidos frente a SARS-CoV-2 que han sido recientemente aprobados, asumiendo que pueden perder efectividad con el cambio del genoma viral. La presente revision tiene por objeto resumir y analizar la situación actual de la vacunación frente a SARS-CoV-2 en el espectro de la ERC enfatizando en los resultados del estudio SENCOVAC. Asimismo, a lo largo de la revisión se discuten los predictores de la respuesta a las diferentes dosis y tipos de vacunas y la integración de estas con los anticuerpos monoclonales y los agentes antivirales.

AB  - Objectives
Existing findings regarding the relationship between comorbidities and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are inconsistent and insufficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between different comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19.
Methods
The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify studies reporting the rates of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients with severe/fatal outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to disease severity and the country of residence. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using random-effects models.
Results
A total of 34 eligible studies were identified. In patients with severe/fatal COVID-19, the most prevalent chronic comorbidities were obesity (42%, 95% CI 34–49%) and hypertension (40%, 95% CI 35–45%), followed by diabetes (17%, 95% CI 15–20%), cardiovascular disease (13%, 95% CI 11–15%), respiratory disease (8%, 95% CI 6–10%), cerebrovascular disease (6%, 95% CI 4–8%), malignancy (4%, 95% CI 3–6%), kidney disease (3%, 95% CI 2–4%), and liver disease (2%, 95% CI 1–3%). In order of the prediction, the pooled ORs of the comorbidities in patients with severe or fatal COVID-19 when compared to patients with non-severe/fatal COVID-19 were as follows: chronic respiratory disease, OR 3.56 (95% CI 2.87–4.41); hypertension, OR 3.17 (95% CI 2.46–4.08); cardiovascular disease, OR 3.13 (95% CI 2.65–3.70); kidney disease, OR 3.02 (95% CI 2.23–4.08); cerebrovascular disease, OR 2.74 (95% CI 1.59–4.74); malignancy, OR 2.73 (95% CI 1.73–4.21); diabetes, OR 2.63 (95% CI 2.08–3.33); and obesity, OR 1.72 (95% CI 1.04–2.85). No correlation was observed between liver disease and COVID-19 aggravation (OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.95–2.49).
Conclusions
Chronic comorbidities, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, kidney disease, and malignancy are clinical risk factors for a severe or fatal outcome associated with COVID-19, with obesity being the most prevalent and respiratory disease being the most strongly predictive. Knowledge of these risk factors could help clinicians better identify and manage the high-risk populations.

AB  - Summary
Communicating public health guidance is key to mitigating risk during disasters and outbreaks, and ethical guidance on communication emphasizes being fully transparent. Yet, communication during the pandemic has sometimes been fraught, due in part to practical and conceptual challenges around being transparent. A particular challenge has arisen when there was both evolving scientific knowledge on COVID-19 and reticence to acknowledge that resource scarcity concerns were influencing public health recommendations. This essay uses the example of communicating public health guidance on masking in the United States to illustrate ethical challenges of developing and conveying public health guidance under twin conditions of uncertainty and resource scarcity. Such situations require balancing two key principles in public health ethics: the precautionary principle and harm reduction. Transparency remains a bedrock value to guide risk communication, but optimizing transparency requires consideration of additional ethical values in developing and implementing risk communication strategies.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The ability of our cells to secrete type I interferons (IFN-Is) is essential for the control of virus replication and for effective antiviral immune responses; for this reason, viruses have evolved the means to antagonize IFN-I. Inhibition of IFN-I production is pronounced in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can impair the adaptive immune response and exacerbate inflammatory disease at late stages of infection. However, therapeutic boosting of IFN-I offers a narrow time window for efficacy and safety. Here, we discuss how limits placed on IFN-I by SARS-CoV-2 shape the immune response and whether this might be countered with therapeutic approaches and vaccine design.

AB  - Summary
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become an epidemic, much like other non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The pathophysiology of NAFLD, particularly involving insulin resistance and subclinical inflammation, is not only closely linked to that of those NCDs but also to a severe course of the communicable disease COVID-19. Genetics alone cannot explain the large increase in the prevalence of NAFLD during the past 2 decades and the increase that is projected for the next decades. Impairment of glucose and lipid metabolic pathways, which has been propelled by the worldwide increase in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, is most likely behind the increase in people with NAFLD. As the prevalence of NAFLD varies among subgroups of patients with diabetes and prediabetes identified by cluster analyses, stratification of people with diabetes and prediabetes by major pathological mechanistic pathways might improve the diagnosis of NAFLD and prediction of its progression. In this Review, we aim to understand how diabetes can affect the development of hepatic steatosis and its progression to advanced liver damage. First, we emphasise the extent to which NAFLD and diabetes jointly occur worldwide. Second, we address the major mechanisms that are involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and type 2 diabetes, and we discuss whether these mechanisms place NAFLD in an important position to better understand the pathogenesis of NCDs and communicable diseases, such as COVID-19. Third, we address whether this knowledge can be used for personalised treatment of NAFLD in the future. Finally, we discuss the current treatment strategies for people with type 2 diabetes and their effectiveness in treating the spectrum of hepatic diseases from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatic fibrosis.

Age-old passive immunization with protective antibodies to neutralize the virus is one of the strategies for emergency prophylaxis and therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, the authors discuss up-to-date advances in immune-based therapy for COVID-19. The use of convalescent plasma therapy as the first line of defense to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been established, with encouraging results. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor have been found to be very promising as a countermeasure for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and clinical trials are underway. Considering the counterproductive antibody-dependent enhancement of the virus, mAbs therapy that is safe and efficacious, even in people with underlying conditions, will be a significant breakthrough. In addition, emerging immunotherapeutic interventions using nanobodies and cellular immunotherapy are promising avenues for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors also discuss the implication of mAbs as mediators of cytokine storm syndrome to modify the immune response of COVID-19 patients, thus reducing the fatality rate of COVID-19 infection.

AB  - COVID-19 is a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Early reported symptoms include fever, cough, and respiratory symptoms. There were few reports of digestive symptoms. However, with COVID-19 spreading worldwide, symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain have gained increasing attention. Research has found that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, is strongly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. Whether theoretically or clinically, many studies have suggested a close connection between COVID-19 and the digestive system. In this review, we summarize the digestive symptoms reported in existing research, discuss the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the gastrointestinal tract and liver, and determine the possible mechanisms and aetiology, such as cytokine storm. In-depth exploration of the relationship between COVID-19 and the digestive system is urgently needed.

AB  - ABSTRACT
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has dramatically challenged the healthcare system of almost all countries. The authorities are struggling to minimize the mortality along with ameliorating the economic downturn. Unfortunately, until now, there has been no promising medicine or vaccine available. Herein, we deliver perspectives of nanotechnology for increasing the specificity and sensitivity of current interventional platforms toward the urgent need of quickly deployable solutions. This review summarizes the recent involvement of nanotechnology from the development of a biosensor to fabrication of a multifunctional nanohybrid system for respiratory and deadly viruses, along with the recent interventions and current understanding about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also in pregnant women. Infection in pregnancy leads to maternal and placental functional alterations. Pregnant women with vascular defects such as preeclampsia show high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection by undefined mechanisms. Pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 show higher rates of preterm birth and caesarean delivery, and their placentas show signs of vasculopathy and inflammation. It is still unclear whether the foetus is affected by the maternal infection with this virus and whether maternal infection associates with postnatal affections. The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes oxidative stress and activation of the immune system leading to cytokine storm and next tissue damage as seen in the lung. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 expression is determinant for these alterations in the lung. Since this enzyme is expressed in the human placenta, SARS-CoV-2 could infect the placenta tissue, although reported to be of low frequency compared with maternal lung tissue. Early-onset preeclampsia (eoPE) shows higher expression of ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17) causing an imbalanced renin-angiotensin system and endothelial dysfunction. A similar mechanism seems to potentially account for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review highlights the potentially common characteristics of pregnant women with eoPE with those with COVID-19. A better understanding of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its impact on the placenta function is determinant since eoPE/COVID-19 association may result in maternal metabolic alterations that might lead to a potential worsening of the foetal programming of diseases in the neonate, young, and adult.

AB  - Given the dramatic increase in critically ill patients who present to the emergency department for care, along with the persistence of boarding of critically ill patients, it is imperative for the emergency physician to be knowledgeable about recent developments in resuscitation and critical care medicine. This review summarizes important articles published in 2020 that pertain to the resuscitation and care of select critically ill patients. These articles have been selected based on the authors annual review of key critical care, emergency medicine and medicine journals and their opinion of the importance of study findings as it pertains to the care of critically ill ED patients. Several key findings from the studies discussed in this paper include the administration of dexamethasone to patients with COVID-19 infection who require mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen, the use of lower levels of positive end-expiratory pressure for patients without acute respiratory distress syndrome, and early initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation if resources are available. Furthermore, the emergency physician should not administer tranexamic acid to patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding or administer the combination of vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone for patients with septic shock. Finally, the emergency physician should titrate vasopressor medications to more closely match a patient's chronic perfusion pressure rather than target a mean arterial blood pressure of 65 mmHg for all critically ill patients.

AB  - Summary
Malaria is resurging in many African and South American countries, exacerbated by COVID-19-related health service disruption. In 2021, there were an estimated 247 million malaria cases and 619 000 deaths in 84 endemic countries. Plasmodium falciparum strains partly resistant to artemisinins are entrenched in the Greater Mekong region and have emerged in Africa, while Anopheles mosquito vectors continue to evolve physiological and behavioural resistance to insecticides. Elimination of Plasmodium vivax malaria is hindered by impractical and potentially toxic antirelapse regimens. Parasitological diagnosis and treatment with oral or parenteral artemisinin-based therapy is the mainstay of patient management. Timely blood transfusion, renal replacement therapy, and restrictive fluid therapy can improve survival in severe malaria. Rigorous use of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy and infancy and seasonal chemoprevention, potentially combined with pre-erythrocytic vaccines endorsed by WHO in 2021 and 2023, can substantially reduce malaria morbidity. Improved surveillance, better access to effective treatment, more labour-efficient vector control, continued drug development, targeted mass drug administration, and sustained political commitment are required to achieve targets for malaria reduction by the end of this decade.

AB  - We continue to increase our cognizance and recognition of the importance of healthy living (HL) behaviors and HL medicine (HLM) to prevent and treat chronic disease. The continually unfolding events precipitated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have further highlighted the importance of HL behaviors, as indicated by the characteristics of those who have been hospitalized and died from this viral infection. There has already been recognition that leading a healthy lifestyle, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, may have a substantial protective effect in those who become infected with the virus. Now more than ever, HL behaviors and HLM are essential and must be promoted with a renewed vigor across the globe. In response to the rapidly evolving world since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the clear need to change lifestyle behaviors to promote human resilience and quality of life, the HL for Pandemic Event Protection (HL-PIVOT) network was established. The 4 major areas of focus for the network are: (1) knowledge discovery and dissemination; (2) education; (3) policy; (4) implementation. This HL-PIVOT network position statement provides a current synopsis of the major focus areas of the network, including leading research in the field of HL behaviors and HLM, examples of best practices in education, policy, and implementation, and recommendations for the future.

AB  - Sedentary behavior (SB) and physical activity (PA) are important risk factors of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. In addition to increasing the amount of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), the current PA guidelines recommend that adults should reduce SB, or any waking activity performed while sitting, reclining, or lying, with low energy expenditure. While mounting evidence has emphasized the benefits of increasing MVPA, little has focused on the effect of SB on health. Therefore, this review discusses the pathophysiological effects of SB and the potential physiological benefits of reducing/breaking up SB at the levels below the current guidelines for PA. Such knowledge is important, given that the majority of the United States population performs insufficient or no MVPA and is at high risk of being negatively impacted by SB. Interventions targeting sedentary time, such as breaking up SB by standing and moving, may be safe, feasible, and applicable to execute daily for a wide range of the population. This review also discusses the importance of monitoring SB in the era of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the clinical implications of sitting less and moving more.

AB  - Hospital admissions due to alcohol-related liver disease (ArLD) are increasing. Both the quantity and the pattern of alcohol consumption are linked to an increased risk of ArLD. However, other factors such as obesity, coexisting liver disease – particularly hepatitis C – gender, nutritional status and genetic factors also play a role. The spectrum of ArLD ranges from steatosis to alcoholic hepatitis to established cirrhosis; a progression of liver injury which involves multiple mechanisms. Excessive alcohol consumption can cause cirrhosis in the absence of alcohol dependency syndrome. The presentation is variable, and recognition requires clinicians to be aware of the significance of a history of alcohol excess, clinical stigmata of liver disease and compatible laboratory investigations. Early detection of liver injury is key. Not all people who drink to excess develop liver disease, and other causes of liver damage must be excluded. The mainstay of management is long-term abstinence, and medical interventions should be delivered in conjunction with addiction services. Nutritional issues should also be addressed. Acute alcoholic hepatitis has a high mortality, and patients with the highest risk can benefit from short-term corticosteroids. Individuals with cirrhosis require hepatoma surveillance and variceal screening; liver transplantation should be considered in selected cases.

AB  - Acute crises, such as a war or a pandemic, are the ultimate tests for health care systems’ resilience (temporary response to stress with change and adaptation) and antifragility (permanent benefit from change in response to stress). In this Health Policy paper, we analyse and discuss how the healthcare systems of two European countries – Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia – adapted to war as a man-made disaster, and how they adapted to COVID-19 pandemic twenty-five years later. These countries experienced full scale wars in recent history, which significantly changed their political and healthcare systems. This experience prepared the countries for the response to the pandemic, which coincided with two earthquakes in Croatia. We argue that healthcare systems in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina are not only resilient but antifragile, and that they benefited from stressors they were exposed to. The antifragility of the two systems were primarily based on human effort – the strength, adaptability and resilience of health care professionals. We will look at lessons from the wars that were applied to the pandemic and discuss newly recognized opportunities and improvements.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has negatively impacted on patients of the whole CKD spectrum, causing high rates of morbi-mortality. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines opened a new era, but patients with CKD (including kidney transplant, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) were systematically excluded from pivotal clinical trials. The Spanish Society of Nephrology promoted the multicentric national SENCOVAC study aimed at assessing immunological responses after vaccination in patients with CKD. During the first year after vaccination, patients with non-dialysis CKD and those on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis presented good anti-Spike antibody responses to vaccination, especially after receiving the third and fourth doses. However, kidney transplant recipients presented suboptimal responses after any vaccination schedule (initial, third and fourth dose). Especially worrisome is the situation of a patients with a persistently negative humoral response that do not seroconvert after boosters. In this regard, monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 have been approved for high-risk patients, although they may become obsolete as the viral genome evolves. The present report reviews the current status of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the CKD spectrum with emphasis on lessons learned from the SENCOVAC study. Predictors of humoral response, including vaccination schedules and types of vaccines, as well as the integration of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antiviral agents are discussed.
Resumen
Síndrome agudo respiratorio severo coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ha impactado negativamente en todos los pacientes con enfermedad renal crónica (ERC), causando elevadas tasas de morbimortalidad. La vacunación frente a SARS-CoV-2 han abierto una nueva era, aunque precisamente los pacientes con ERC (incluyendo los portadores de un injerto renal y aquellos en programas de hemodiálisis y diálisis peritoneal) han sido sistemáticamente excluidos de los ensayos clínicos. La Sociedad Española de Nefrología (S.E.N.) promovió el estudio multicéntrico SENCOVAC para evaluar la respuesta inmunológica tras la vacunación en todo el espectro de la ERC. Un año después de haber recibido la pauta inicial de vacunación, los pacientes con ERC sin necesidad de diálisis, y aquellos en hemodiálisis y diálisis peritoneal, han presenado una adecuada respuesta humoral (monitorizada con el desarrollo de anticuerpos frente a la proteína Spike), especialmente después de recibir la tercera y la cuarta dosis. Sin embargo, los portadores de un injerto renal han presentado una constante respuesta subóptima en cualquier momento de la vacunación (dosis inicial, tercera y cuarta dosis). Especialmente preocupante es la situación de los pacientes con respuesta humoral persistentemente negativa que no seroconvierten incluso ni tras recibir las dosis de recuerdo o boosters. En ese contexto, el manejo probablemente pasa por el uso de anticuerpos monoclonales dirigidos frente a SARS-CoV-2 que han sido recientemente aprobados, asumiendo que pueden perder efectividad con el cambio del genoma viral. La presente revision tiene por objeto resumir y analizar la situación actual de la vacunación frente a SARS-CoV-2 en el espectro de la ERC enfatizando en los resultados del estudio SENCOVAC. Asimismo, a lo largo de la revisión se discuten los predictores de la respuesta a las diferentes dosis y tipos de vacunas y la integración de estas con los anticuerpos monoclonales y los agentes antivirales.

AB  - Summary
COVID-19 is disrupting and transforming the world. We argue that transformations catalysed by this pandemic should be used to improve human and planetary health and wellbeing. This paradigm shift requires decision makers and policy makers to go beyond building back better, by nesting the economic domain of sustainable development within social and environmental domains. Drawing on the engage, assess, align, accelerate, and account (E4As) approach to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we explore the implications of this kind of radical transformative change, focusing particularly on the role of the health sector. We conclude that a recovery and transition from the COVID-19 pandemic that delivers the future humanity wants and needs requires more than a technical understanding of the transformation at hand. It also requires commitment and courage from leaders and policy makers to challenge dominant constructs and to work towards a truly thriving, equitable, and sustainable future to create a world where economic development is not an end goal itself, but a means to secure the health and wellbeing of people and the planet.

AB  - The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) caused the ongoing pandemic named COVID‐19 which causes a serious emergency on public health hazards of international concern. In the face of a critical medical emergency, repositioning of drugs is one of the most authentic options to design an adequate treatment for infected patients immediately. In this strategy, Remdesivir (Veklury), Hydroxychloroquine appears to be the drug of choice and garnered unprecedented attention as potential therapeutic agents against the pandemic realized worldwide due to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. These are the breathtaking instances of possible repositioning of drugs, whose pharmacokinetics and optimal dosage are familiar. In this review, we provide an overview of these medications, their synthesis, and the possible mechanism of action against SARS‐CoV‐2.

AB  - The 2019 corona virus disease (COVID-19) has caused a global chaos, where a novel Omicron variant has challenged the healthcare system, followed by which it has been referred to as a variant of concern (VOC) by the World Health Organization (WHO), owing to its alarming transmission and infectivity rate. The large number of mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is responsible for strengthening of the spike-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction, thereby explaining the elevated threat. This is supplemented by enhanced resistance of the variant towards pre-existing antibodies approved for the COVID-19 therapy. The manuscript brings into light failure of existing therapies to provide the desired effect, however simultaneously discussing the novel possibilities on the verge of establishing suitable treatment portfolio. The authors entail the risks associated with omicron resistance against antibodies and vaccine ineffectiveness on one side, and novel approaches and targets – kinase inhibitors, viral protease inhibitors, phytoconstituents, entry pathways – on the other. The manuscript aims to provide a holistic picture about the Omicron variant, by providing comprehensive discussions related to multiple aspects of the mutated spike variant, which might aid the global researchers and healthcare experts in finding an optimised solution to this pandemic.

AB  - Background and aims
The measurement of vital signs is an important part of clinical work up. Presently, measurement of blood glucose is a factor for concern mostly when treating individuals with diabetes. Significance of blood glucose measurement in prognosis of non-diabetic and hospitalized patients is not clear.
Methods
A systematic search of literature published in the Electronic databases, PubMed and Google Scholar was performed using following keywords; blood glucose, hospital admissions, critical illness, hospitalizations, cardiovascular disease (CVD), morbidity, and mortality. This literature search was largely restricted to non-diabetic individuals.
Results
Blood glucose level, even when in high normal range, or in slightly high range, is an important determinant of morbidity and mortality, especially in hospitalized patients. Further, even slight elevation of blood glucose may increase mortality in patients with COVID-19. Finally, blood glucose variability and hypoglycemia in critically ill individuals without diabetes causes excess in-hospital complications and mortality.
Conclusion
In view of these data, we emphasize the significance of blood glucose measurement in all patients admitted to the hospital regardless of presence of diabetes. We propose that blood glucose be included as the “fifth vital sign” for any hospitalized patient.

AB  - Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a severe threat to human life and the global economy. Although conventional treatments, including vaccines, antibodies, and small-molecule inhibitors, have been broadly developed, they usually fall behind the constant mutation of SARS-CoV-2, due to the long screening process and high production cost. Functional nucleic acid (FNA)-based therapeutics are a newly emerging promising means against COVID-19, considering their timely adaption to different mutants and easy design for broad-spectrum virus inhibition. In this review, we survey typical FNA-related therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 infection, including aptamers, aptamer-integrated DNA frameworks, functional RNA, and CRISPR-Cas technology. We first introduce the pathogenesis, transmission, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, then analyze the existing therapeutic and prophylactic strategies, including their pros and cons. Subsequently, the FNAs are recommended as potent alternative therapeutics from their screening process and controllable engineering to effective neutralization. Finally, we put forward the remaining challenges of the existing field and sketch out the future development directions.

AB  - The role of cholesterol in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other coronavirus-host cell interactions is currently being discussed in the context of two main scenarios: i) the presence of the neutral lipid in cholesterol-rich lipid domains involved in different steps of the viral infection and ii) the alteration of metabolic pathways by the virus over the course of infection. Cholesterol-enriched lipid domains have been reported to occur in the lipid envelope membrane of the virus, in the host-cell plasma membrane, as well as in endosomal and other intracellular membrane cellular compartments. These membrane subdomains, whose chemical and physical properties distinguish them from the bulk lipid bilayer, have been purported to participate in diverse phenomena, from virus-host cell fusion to intracellular trafficking and exit of the virions from the infected cell. SARS-CoV-2 recruits many key proteins that participate under physiological conditions in cholesterol and lipid metabolism in general. This review analyses the status of cholesterol and lipidome proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the new horizons they open for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - The current pandemic due to the fast spreading of SARS-CoV-2 infection has caused severe impairment in health, social, economic, scientific, and medical sectors across the globe. Owing to the not so well understood mechanism of disease pathogenesis in terms of variations in immune responses, there remains obscure why some of the patients who are infected by the novel SARS-CoV-2 develop an unpredictable clinical course that rapidly causes severe and deadly complications/manifestations. Currently, several assays are available for the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the point of care. However, none of these assays can predict the severity of the COVID-19 disease. Thus, the identification of a prognostic biomarker that forecasts the condition of SARS-CoV-2 patients to develop a severe form of the disease could enable the clinicians for more efficient patient triage and treatment. In this regard, the present review describes the role of selected biomolecules that are crucially involved in the immune-pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection such as hyper-immune responsiveness, bradykinin storm and vascular leakage assuming these may serve as an effective prognostic biomarker in COVID-19 to understand the outcome of the disease. Based on the review, we also propose the development of a cost-effective SERS-based prognostic biosensor for the detection and quantification of biomolecules for use as a point-of-care system during a disease outbreak.

AB  - Silent hypoxemia is common in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In this article, the possible pathophysiological mechanisms underlying respiratory symptoms have been reviewed, and the presence of hypoxemia without hypoxia is also discussed. The experience we have gained since the start of the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed our point of view about which patients with respiratory involvement should be admitted to the intensive care unit/high-dependency unit for mechanical ventilation and monitoring. In patients with clinically well-tolerated mild to moderate hypoxemia (silent hypoxemia), regardless of the extent of pulmonary opacities found in radiological studies, the administration of supplemental oxygen therapy may increase the risk of endothelial damage. The risk of sudden respiratory arrest during emergency intubation, which could expose healthcare workers to infection, should be considered along with the risks of premature intubation. Criteria for intubation need to be revisited based on updated evidence showing that many patients with severe hypoxemia do not show increased work of breathing. This has implications in patient management and may explain in part reports of broad differences in outcomes among intubated patients.

AB  - Non-communicable, chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) affect millions of individuals worldwide. The course of these CRDs (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis) are often punctuated by microbial infections that may result in hospitalization and are associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality, as well as reduced quality of life. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a key protein that regulates airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion. There has been much interest in IL-13 from the last two decades. This cytokine is believed to play a decisive role in the exacerbation of inflammation during the course of viral infections, especially, in those with pre-existing CRDs. Here, we discuss the common viral infections in CRDs, as well as the potential role that IL-13 plays in the virus-induced disease pathogenesis of CRDs. We also discuss, in detail, the immune-modulation potential of IL-13 that could be translated to in-depth studies to develop IL-13-based therapeutic entities.

AB  - Neurological symptoms occur in approximately one-third of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among these symptoms, hypoxic encephalopathy develops in one-fifth of severe cases, while ischemic strokes due to thrombotic complications are common in one-third of COVID-19 intensive care patients. Brain involvement of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is eventuated by several routes, including hematogenous spread, transsynaptic entry through infected neurons, olfactory nerve, ocular epithelium, vascular endothelium, and impaired blood–brain barrier. Besides the high angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) binding affinity, and FURIN preactivation, SARS-CoV-2 maintains efficient neuronal entry while evading immune surveillance by using basigin and neuropilin-1 receptors. However, the neurological manifestations and their pathogenic mechanisms are still debated in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a versatile polymer that is widely used as an additive in foods and cosmetics, and as a carrier in PEGylated therapeutics. Even though PEG is thought to be less immunogenic, or perhaps even non-immunogenic, with a variety of physicochemical properties, there is mounting evidence that PEG causes immunogenic responses when conjugated with other materials such as proteins and nanocarriers. Under these conditions, PEG with other materials can result in the production of anti-PEG antibodies after administration. The antibodies that are induced seem to have a deleterious impact on the therapeutic efficacy of subsequently administered PEGylated formulations. In addition, hypersensitivity to PEGylated formulations could be a significant barrier to the utility of PEGylated products. Several reports have linked the presence of anti-PEG antibodies to incidences of complement activation-related pseudoallergy (CARPA) following the administration of PEGylated formulations. The use of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, which are composed mainly of PEGylated lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), has recently gained wide acceptance, although many cases of post-vaccination hypersensitivity have been documented. Therefore, our review focuses not only on the importance of PEGs and its great role in improving the therapeutic efficacy of various medications, but also on the hypersensitivity reactions attributed to the use of PEGylated products that include PEG-based mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - Background
Disease outbreaks and disasters can result in excess deaths and severe disruption of usual end-of-life care processes. We aimed to: i) synthesise evidence describing the experiences of health and social care staff providing end-of-life care during a disease outbreak or humanitarian disaster, ii) understand the impact on their mental health and wellbeing and, iii) identify means of support.
Methods
A systematic review with meta-synthesis was conducted including studies of health and social care staff providing end-of-life care during disease outbreaks (Ebola, COVID-19, SARs, MERs) or humanitarian disasters (2001–2020). MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and grey literature databases were searched systematically, with forward and backward citation searching of included studies. Any research study designs, in any care settings, were included. Study quality was assessed using an appraisal tool relevant to each study design. Qualitative meta-synthesis was used to analyse the findings, which were then reported narratively. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020181444.
Results
Nineteen studies were included, including 10 Ebola studies and two COVID-19 studies. The analysis generated two superordinate themes: individual experience and organisational responsibilities. Individual experience comprised four themes: dignity in death, positive experiences, negative experience and support for staff. Organisational responsibilities comprised four themes: preparation, adaption, resources, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
Discussion
No studies quantitively measured the impact of providing end-of-life care on staff mental health and wellbeing, however qualitative studies described experiences in varied settings. Serious disease outbreaks and disasters can expose care staff to abnormally high levels of mortality and suffering. Health and social care systems need to proactively prepare for future events and enable peer support mechanisms that may help mitigate experiences of psychological distress in humanitarian crises.

This “Year in review” presents a selection of research themes and individual studies from the clinical osteoarthritis (OA) field (epidemiology and therapy) and includes noteworthy descriptive, analytical-observational, and intervention studies. The electronic database search for the review was conducted in Medline, Embase and medRxiv (15th April 2020 to 1st April 2021). Following study screening, the following OA-related themes emerged: COVID-19; disease burden; occupational risk; prediction models; cartilage loss and pain; stem cell treatments; novel pharmacotherapy trials; therapy for less well researched OA phenotypes; benefits and challenges of Individual Participant Data (IPD) meta-analyses; patient choice-balancing benefits and harms; OA and comorbidity; and inequalities in OA. Headline study findings included: a longitudinal cohort study demonstrating no evidence for a harmful effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in terms of COVID-19 related deaths; a Global Burden of Disease study reporting a 102% increase in crude incidence rate of OA in 2017 compared to 1990; a longitudinal study reporting cartilage thickness loss was associated with only a very small degree of worsening in pain over 2 years; an exploratory analysis of a non-OA randomised controlled trial (RCT) finding reduced risk of total joint replacement with an Interleukin -1β inhibitor (canakinumab); a significant relationship between cumulative disadvantage and clinical outcomes of pain and depression mediated by perceived discrimination in a secondary analysis from a RCT; worsening socioeconomic circumstances were associated with future arthritis diagnosis in an innovative natural experiment (with implications for unique research possibilities arising from the COVID-19 pandemic context).

AB  - Fungal pathogens contribute to significant disease burden globally; however, the fact that fungi are eukaryotes has greatly complicated their role in fungal-mediated infections and alleviation. Antifungal drugs are often toxic to host cells and there is increasing evidence of adaptive resistance in animals and humans. Existing fungal diagnostic and treatment regimens have limitations that has contributed to the alarming high mortality rates and prolonged morbidity seen in immunocompromised cohorts caused by opportunistic invasive infections as evidenced during HIV and COVID-19 pandemics. There is a need to develop real-time monitoring and diagnostic methods for fungal pathogens and to create a greater awareness as to the contribution of fungal pathogens in disease causation. Greater information is required on the appropriate selection and dose of antifungal drugs including factors governing resistance where there is commensurate need to discover more appropriate and effective solutions. Popular azole fungal drugs are widely detected in surface water and sediment due to incomplete removal in wastewater treatment plants where they are resistant to microbial degradation and may cause toxic effects on aquatic organisms such as algae and fish. UV has limited effectiveness in destruction of anti-fungal drugs where there is increased interest in the combination approaches such as novel use of pulsed-plasma gas-discharge technologies for environmental waste management. There is growing interest in developing alternative and complementary green eco-biocides and disinfection innovation. Fungi present challenges for cleaning, disinfection and sterilization of reusable medical devices such as endoscopes where they (example, Aspergillus and Candida species) can be protected when harboured in build-up biofilm from lethal processing. Information on the efficacy of established disinfection and sterilization technologies to address fungal pathogens including bottleneck areas that present high risk to patients is lacking. There is a need to address risk mitigation and modelling to inform efficacy of appropriate intervention technologies that must consider all contributing factors where there is potential to adopt digital technologies to enable real-time analysis of big data, such as use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. International consensus on standardised protocols for developing and reporting on appropriate alternative eco-solutions must be reached, particularly in order to address fungi with increasing drug resistance where research and innovation can be enabled using a One Health approach.

AB  - Upon initial discovery in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, has managed to spread across the planet. A plethora of symptoms affecting multiple organ systems have been described, with the most common being nonspecific upper respiratory symptoms: cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. However, the cardiovascular system is also at risk following COVID-19 infection. Numerous cardiovascular complications have been reported by physicians globally, in particular cardiac tamponade Physicians must hold a high index of suspicion in identifying and treating patients with cardiac tamponade who may have contracted the novel coronavirus. This review will describe the current epidemiology and pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and cardiac tamponade, highlighting their clinical course progression and the implications it may have for the severity of both illnesses. The paper will also review published case reports of cardiac tamponade, clinical presentation, and treatment of this complication, as well as the disease as a whole.

AB  - Summary
Hyperthyroidism is a common condition with a global prevalence of 0·2–1·3%. When clinical suspicion of hyperthyroidism arises, it should be confirmed by biochemical tests (eg, low TSH, high free thyroxine [FT4], or high free tri-iodothyonine [FT3]). If hyperthyroidism is confirmed by biochemical tests, a nosological diagnosis should be done to find out which disease is causing the hyperthyroidism. Helpful tools are TSH-receptor antibodies, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, thyroid ultrasonography, and scintigraphy. Hyperthyroidism is mostly caused by Graves' hyperthyroidism (70%) or toxic nodular goitre (16%). Hyperthyroidism can also be caused by subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (3%) and drugs (9%) such as amiodarone, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Disease-specific recommendations are given. Currently, Graves' hyperthyroidism is preferably treated with antithyroid drugs. However, recurrence of hyperthyroidism after a 12–18 month course of antithyroid drugs occurs in approximately 50% of patients. Being younger than 40 years, having FT4 concentrations that are 40 pmol/L or higher, having TSH-binding inhibitory immunoglobulins that are higher than 6 U/L, and having a goitre size that is equivalent to or larger than WHO grade 2 before the start of treatment with antithyroid drugs increase risk of recurrence. Long-term treatment with antithyroid drugs (ie, 5–10 years of treatment) is feasible and associated with fewer recurrences (15%) than short-term treatment (ie, 12–18 months of treatment). Toxic nodular goitre is mostly treated with radioiodine (131I) or thyroidectomy and is rarely treated with radiofrequency ablation. Destructive thyrotoxicosis is usually mild and transient, requiring steroids only in severe cases. Specific attention is given to patients with hyperthyroidism who are pregnant, have COVID-19, or have other complications (eg, atrial fibrillation, thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, and thyroid storm). Hyperthyroidism is associated with increased mortality. Prognosis might be improved by rapid and sustained control of hyperthyroidism. Innovative new treatments are expected for Graves' disease, by targeting B cells or TSH receptors.

AB  - The Coronavirus-associated disease, that was first identified in 2019 in China (CoViD-19), is a pandemic caused by a bat-derived beta-coronavirus, named SARS-CoV2. It shares homology with SARS and MERS-CoV, responsible for past outbreaks in China and in Middle East. SARS-CoV2 spread from China where the first infections were described in December 2019 and is responsible for the respiratory symptoms that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. A cytokine storm has been shown in patients who develop fatal complications, as observed in past coronavirus infections. The management includes ventilatory support and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, empirically utilized, as a targeted therapy and vaccines have not been developed. Based upon our limited knowledge on the pathogenesis of CoViD-19, a potential role of some anti-rheumatic drugs may be hypothesized, acting as direct antivirals or targeting host immune response. Antimalarial drugs, commonly used in rheumatology, may alter the lysosomal proteases that mediates the viral entry into the cell and have demonstrated efficacy in improving the infection. Anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 may interfere with the cytokine storm in severe cases and use of tocilizumab has shown good outcomes in a small cohort. Baricitinib has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Checkpoints inhibitors such as anti-CD200 and anti-PD1 could have a role in the treatment of CoViD-19. Rheumatic disease patients taking immunosuppressive drugs should be recommended to maintain the chronic therapy, prevent infection by avoiding social contacts and pausing immunosuppressants in case of infection. National and international registries are being created to collect data on rheumatic patients with CoViD-19.

AB  - From the introduction of hyperferritinemic syndrome concept, a growing body of evidence has suggested the role of ferritin as a pathogenic mediator and a relevant clinical feature in the management of patients with inflammatory diseases. From a pathogenic point of view, ferritin may directly stimulate the aberrant immune response by triggering the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in inducing a vicious pathogenic loop and contributing to the occurrence of cytokine storm syndrome. The latter has been recently defined as a clinical picture characterised by elevated circulating cytokine levels, acute systemic inflammatory symptoms, and secondary organ dysfunction beyond that which could be attributed to a normal response to a pathogen It is noteworthy that the occurrence of hyperferritinemia may be correlated with the development of the cytokine storm syndrome in the context of an inflammatory disease. In addition to adult onset Still’s disease, macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic anti-phospholipids syndrome, and septic shock, recent evidence has suggested this association between ferritin and life-threatening evolution in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, with anti-MDA5 antibodies in the context of poly-dermatomyositis, with severe COVID-19, and with multisystem inflammatory syndrome. The possible underlying common inflammatory mechanisms, associated with hyperferritinemia, may led to the similar clinical picture observed in these patients. Furthermore, similar therapeutic strategies could be suggested inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines and improving long-term outcomes in these disorders. Thus, it could be possible to expand the spectrum of the hyperferritinemic syndrome to those diseases burdened by a dreadful clinical picture correlated with hyperferritinemia and the occurrence of the cytokine storm syndrome. In addition, the assessment of ferritin may provide useful information to the physicians in clinical practice to manage these patients. Therefore, ferritin may be considered a relevant clinical feature to be used as biomarker in dissecting the unmet needs in the management of these disorders. Novel evidence may thus support an expansion of the spectrum of the hyperferritinemic syndrome to these diseases burdened by a life-threatening clinical picture correlated with hyperferritinemia and the occurrence of the cytokine storm syndrome.

AB  - Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) is caused by mutations in the Autoimmune Regulator (AIRE) gene, which impair the thymic negative selection of self-reactive T-cells and underlie the development of autoimmunity that targets multiple endocrine and non-endocrine tissues. Beyond autoimmunity, APECED features heightened susceptibility to certain specific infections, which is mediated by anti-cytokine autoantibodies and/or T-cell driven autoimmune tissue injury. These include the ‘signature’ APECED infection chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), but also life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, bronchiectasis-associated bacterial pneumonia, and sepsis by encapsulated bacteria. Here we discuss the expanding understanding of the immunological mechanisms that contribute to infection susceptibility in this prototypic syndrome of impaired central tolerance, which provide the foundation for devising improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for affected patients.

AB  - Background
On 31st December 2019 in Wuhan, China, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was acknowledged. This virus spread quickly throughout the world causing a global pandemic. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic disease on 11th March 2020. Since then, the whole world has come together and have developed several vaccines against this deadly virus. Similarly, several alternative searches for pandemic disease therapeutics are still ongoing. One of them has been identified as nanotechnology. It has demonstrated significant promise for detecting and inhibiting a variety of viruses, including coronaviruses. Several nanoparticles, including gold nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon dots, graphene oxide nanoparticles, and zinc oxide nanoparticles, have previously demonstrated remarkable antiviral activity against a diverse array of viruses.
Objective
This review aims to provide a basic and comprehensive overview of COVID-19's initial global outbreak and its mechanism of infiltration into human host cells, as well as the detailed mechanism and inhibitory effects of various nanoparticles against this virus. In addition to nanoparticles, this review focuses on the role of several antiviral drugs used against COVID-19 to date.
Conclusion
COVID-19 has severely disrupted the social and economic lives of people all over the world. Due to a lack of adequate medical facilities, countries have struggled to maintain control of the situation. Neither a drug nor a vaccine has a 100% efficacy rate. As a result, nanotechnology may be a better therapeutic alternative for this pandemic disease.

In addition, heterogeneity in microvascular perfusion is a key finding in sepsis. In this narrative review, we report our actual understanding of microvascular alterations, their role in the development of organ dysfunction, and the implications for outcome. Herein, we discuss the state of the potential therapeutic interventions and the potential impact of novel therapies. We also discuss how recent technologic development may affect the evaluation of microvascular perfusion.

AB  - Loneliness or social isolation and food/eating behaviours have important health consequences and there are rationales for why they could interact. Loneliness and dietary behaviours are recognised as health determinants and targets for interventions at individual, group and population levels. However, there are currently no research reviews investigating associations between these areas. This scoping review synthesized evidence investigating loneliness or social isolation and food/eating behaviours in people aged over 16 years in high-income countries. A systematic search of five databases from 2000 was conducted using predetermined search terms. Dissertation database and backwards citation searches were also conducted. Full text screening of 254 articles/theses resulted in inclusion of three qualitative and 26 quantitative studies, with eight conducted in COVID-19 lockdowns. Almost all studies reported a relationship between loneliness/social isolation and eating behaviours usually considered harmful such as low fruit and vegetable intake and lower diet quality. Qualitative research also supports the detrimental influence of loneliness or social isolation on eating. Study quality was considered, and interpretation and comparison of results was complicated by use of varying methods. Better awareness and understanding of the relationship between these complex aspects of health is needed to inform the development of interventions and practice of nutrition and mental health practitioners, policymakers, researchers and end-users.

AB  - Patients with the severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been frequently found to suffer from both arterial and venous thrombotic events due to the perpetuation of a hypercoagulable state. This phenomenon, termed COVID-19–associated coagulopathy, is now considered a major component of the pathophysiology of this novel infectious disease, leading to widespread thrombosis. While at first, the vascular insults may be limited to the pulmonary microvasculature, as the disease progresses, systemic involvement occurs, culminating in distant organ thrombosis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. In this review article, we discuss recent insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of COVID-19–associated coagulopathy and review the clinical, histopathologic, and laboratory evidence, which leads us to conclude that COVID-19 is both a pulmonary and vascular disorder.

AB  - Particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the outdoor air pollutants that are major factors in diseases, causing especially adverse respiratory effects in humans. On the other hand, the role of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory infections is an issue of great importance. The present literature review was aimed at assessing the potential effects of air pollutants on the transmission and severity of respiratory viral infections. We have reviewed the scientific literature regarding the association of outdoor air pollution and respiratory viruses on respiratory diseases. Evidence supports a clear association between air concentrations of some pollutants and human respiratory viruses interacting to adversely affect the respiratory system. Given the undoubted importance and topicality of the subject, we have paid special attention to the association between air pollutants and the transmission and severity of the effects caused by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, which causes the COVID-19. Although to date, and by obvious reasons, the number of studies on this issue are still scarce, most results indicate that chronic exposure to air pollutants delays/complicates recovery of patients of COVID-19 and leads to more severe and lethal forms of this disease. This deserves immediate and in-depth experimental investigations.

AB  - Erythrocytes are the most abundant type of cells in the blood and have a relatively simple structure when mature; they have a long life-span in the circulatory system. The primary function of erythrocytes is as oxygen carriers; however, they also play an important role in the immune system. Erythrocytes recognize and adhere to antigens and promote phagocytosis. The abnormal morphology and function of erythrocytes are also involved in the pathological processes of some diseases. Owing to the large number and immune properties of erythrocytes, their immune functions should not be ignored. Currently, research on immunity is focused on immune cells other than erythrocytes. However, research on the immune function of erythrocytes and the development of erythrocyte-mediated applications is of great significance. Therefore, we aimed to review the relevant literature and summarize the immune functions of erythrocytes.

AB  - Background
Redlining was a racialized zoning practice in the U.S. that blocked fair access to home loans during the 1930s, and recent research is illuminating health problems in the current residents of these historically redlined areas. However, this work has not yet been holistically summarized. Here, we present the first systematic review and meta-analysis comparing health outcomes in redlined versus non-redlined neighborhoods in U.S. cities.
Methods
We extracted relevant articles in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and Science Direct databases published from January 2010 to September 2021.
Results
The search revealed 12 studies on preterm births (n = 3), gunshot-related injuries (n = 2), cancer (n = 1), asthma (n = 1), self-rated health (n = 1), multiple health outcomes (n = 2), heat-related outcomes (n = 1) and COVID-19 incidence and mortality (n = 1). A meta-analysis of three studies found the odds of having preterm birth was significantly higher (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.88; p = 0.02) among women living in redlined areas compared to those in non-redlined areas. Review of other outcomes revealed that gunshot-related injuries, asthma, heat-related outcomes, and multiple chronic conditions were worse in redlined areas, while associations with cancer varied by cancer type. In terms of cause-specific mortality, one study revealed no link between residential redlining and infant mortality rate, while one study on COVID-19 outcomes was inconclusive.
Conclusions
Overall, this review presents evidence that living in historically redlined areas is associated with increased risk of multiple serious adverse health outcomes. Further research on mechanisms, remediation, and neighborhood-level interventions is needed to strengthen the understanding of the impacts of redlining on health.

AB  - Summary
The emergence of highly pathogenic strains of influenza virus and coronavirus (CoV) has been responsible for large epidemic and pandemic outbreaks characterised by severe pulmonary illness associated with high morbidity and mortality. One major challenge for critical care is to stratify and minimise the risk of multi-organ failure during the stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Epigenetic-sensitive mechanisms, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs may lead to perturbations of the host immune-related transcriptional programmes by regulating chromatin structure and gene expression patterns. Viruses causing severe pulmonary illness can use epigenetic-regulated mechanisms during host–pathogen interaction to interfere with innate and adaptive immunity, adequacy of inflammatory response, and overall outcome of viral infections. For example, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV and H5N1 can affect host antigen presentation through DNA methylation and histone modifications. The same mechanisms would presumably occur in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, in which tocilizumab may epigenetically reduce microvascular damage. Targeting epigenetic pathways by immune modulators (e.g. tocilizumab) or repurposed drugs (e.g. statins) may provide novel therapeutic opportunities to control viral–host interaction during critical illness. In this review, we provide an update on epigenetic-sensitive mechanisms and repurposed drugs interfering with epigenetic pathways which may be clinically suitable for risk stratification and beneficial for treatment of patients affected by severe viral respiratory infections.
