AB  - Objectives
This study aimed to ascertain which factors are associated with higher risk of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 Bolivian patients.
Methods
This retrospective observational study assessed risk factors associated with mortality in patients (n = 549) hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a Bolivian hospital between April 6, 2020, and August 18, 2022.
Results
The results provide evidence of association between male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-2.6), older age, 51-61 years-old (OR = 5.2, 95% CI 2.2-12.6), 62-70 years-old (OR = 8.7, 95% CI 3.7-20.5), >70 years-old (OR = 16.9, 95% CI 7.1-39.9), and blood group A (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.4) with higher mortality risk. The strong association between mortality and relatively young age, may be due to high frequency of undiagnosed comorbidities. Vaccination was associated with a reduction in mortality only when time period of hospitalization was not adjusted for.
Conclusion
Among hospitalized patients in Bolivia male sex, older age, and blood group A are associated with higher mortality risk. Mortality risk increased markedly from a relatively young age and decreased in parallel to the uptake of the vaccination program. However, the gradual reduction in mortality can also be due to improved patient management and changes in natural immunity and virulence of circulating strains as the pandemic progressed.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seriously threatens public health safety and the global economy, which warrant effective prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. Currently, vaccination and establishment of immunity have significantly reduced the severity and mortality of COVID-19. However, in regard to COVID-19 vaccines, the broad-spectrum protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants and the blocking of virus transmission need to be further improved. In this study, an optimum oral COVID-19 vaccine candidate, rVSVΔG-Sdelta, was selected from a panel of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based constructs bearing spike proteins from different SARS-CoV-2 strains. After chitosan modification, rVSVΔG-Sdelta induced both local and peripheral antibody response, particularly, broad-spectrum and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 persisted for 1 year. Cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 WT, Beta, Delta, BA.1, and BA.2 strains was achieved in golden hamsters, which presented as significantly reduced viral replication in the respiratory tract and alleviated pulmonary pathology post SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Overall, this study provides a convenient, oral-delivered, and effective oral mucosal vaccine against COVID-19, which would supplement pools and facilitate the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - The recently prevalent variants of concerns (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2 belong to Omicron variants which display increased transmissibility and evade from immune protection generated by vaccines and/or natural infections. Better immunization strategies should be explored to induce broader immune responses against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we used inactivated vaccines derived from ancestral (Wu), Delta (Del) and Omicron (Omi) strains to immunize mice with homologous booster (3 × Wu, 3 × Del and 3 × Omi) or heterologous sequential booster (Wu/Del/Omi and Omi/Wu/Del) to evaluate their responses against two pre-Omicron (Wu and Del) and four Omicron variants. Even though neutralization responses against Wu and Del variants were similar in heterologous and homologous immunization groups, heterologous immunization groups induced significantly stronger neutralizing antibody against BA.1 (4.1–11 folds higher) and BA.2 (4.7–14.2 folds higher) than those of homologous immunization groups. While homologous immunization only induced strong neutralizing responses to either pre-Omicron variants (Wu and Del) in 3 × Wu and 3 × Del groups or to Omicron variants (BA.1 and BA.2) in 3 × Omi group, heterologous immunization groups induced strong and broader neutralizing responses to both pre-Omicron (Wu, Del) and Omicron variants (BA.1 and BA.2). Homologous and heterologous immunization groups elicited similar antigen-specific T cell (IFN-γ+) and B cell responses. Compared with homologous immunization, heterologous immunization could induce stronger plasma cell responses, which have the potential to generate broader and stronger neutralizing antibodies. However, neither heterologous nor homologous immunization groups induced strong neutralizing antibody against variants with bigger genetic deviation, such as BA.4/5 or BF.7, only weak neutralizing responses were induced. Surveillance on SARS-CoV2 variants evolution and immunization strategy are needed to explore better vaccines with broader and stronger neutralizing antibodies against post pandemic COVID-19.

AB  - The theme of the 76th session of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly (2021) stresses on the need to tackle the global coronavirus pandemic and other challenging issues presently staring our world in the face. World leaders have tried to contribute their own quota towards changing the present narrative by vaccinating a large portion of their population. However, vaccine hesitancy has served as a barrier to achieving herd immunity in nations-Nigeria inclusive. The sociological theory of phenomenology and the concept of ‘‘sick role’’ were employed as the theoretical framework upon which the study was anchored. Descriptive cross-sectional survey and purposive sampling were used in the work. Data for the study was generated through primary (online survey of 150 respondents) and secondary sources. The content and thematic techniques were used to analyze the data so gathered. The causal factors of vaccine hesitancy in Nigeria were uncovered to include: ‘negative human awareness’, lack of or low public knowledge/agreement on public health need of the vaccine, disconnect (public mistrust of government) between the people and government and lack of awareness/proximity of vaccination points, among others. The paper recommends strategies for massive advocacy/social mobilization to counter negative social interaction and narratives making the rounds on the intake of the COVID-19 vaccine by the Nigerian populace to build general consensus on the need for the vaccine and adoption of the Nigeria Polio vaccination model of taking vaccine down to the people.

AB  - Objectives
French Guiana, the least-vaccinated French territory, also has the lowest COVID-19 vaccination coverage in Latin America. We aimed to estimate how many deaths, hospitalizations and costs the vaccines had and could have avoided.
Methods
We calculated the Number Needed to Vaccinate to prevent one death per year, 1 standard hospitalization, 1 Intensive Care Unit admission given the mean incidence numbers of the past 6 months, and divided the number of persons vaccinated to estimate how many deaths and hospitalizations had been avoided in French Guiana at that time.
Results
The crude number needed to vaccinate to prevent one death per year, the crude number needed to vaccinate to prevent one hospitalization per 6 months were computed Based on our observed incidence and ICU admission rate, the crude number needed to vaccinate to prevent one ICU admission per 6 months. After 6 months with an incidence exceeding 400 per million inhabitants, and 148 observed deaths, we estimate that vaccination avoided 46 deaths (IC95%=43.5–48.7). If the number of vaccinated persons had reached the same proportion as mainland France, 141 deaths per year could have been prevented (IC95%=131.9–147.6). With 2085 hospitalization and 370 ICU admissions during the same period, we estimate that the current albeit low vaccination rate avoided 300 hospital (IC95%=280–313) and 77 (IC95%=72–81) ICU admissions. With the same vaccination rates as mainland France, we estimate that 900 hospitalizations and 231 ICU admissions would have been avoided. Similarly, there would have been 139 ICU admission (instead of 370).
Conclusions
In sparsely populated French Guiana these numbers are quite substantial and framing the vaccine benefits and wasted opportunities using such concrete numbers may help convincing undecided persons to get vaccinated.

Background
Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) experienced reduced SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response and were at increased risk of severe COVID-19. It is unknown if level of vaccine induced anti-receptor binding domain IgG (anti-RBD IgG) correlates with protection from and survival following COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the effect of vaccine response on risk of breakthrough infections (BTI) and COVID-19 death in KTRs.
Methods
We performed a nationwide study, examining the competing risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related/unrelated death, and vaccine efficacy as assessed by level of anti-RBD IgG response 4–10 weeks after each vaccination. The study included all KTR in Norway alive and with a functioning graft on February 20th, 2020, and events after November 11th, 2022 were right-censored. A pre-pandemic reference-cohort from January 1st 2019 to January 1st 2020 was included to evaluate excess mortality. The study was conducted at Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Norway.
Findings
The study included 3607 KTRs (59 [48–70] years) with a functioning graft at February 20th, 2020, who received (median [IQR]) 4 [3–4] vaccines (range 2–6, 99% mRNA). Anti-RBD IgG was measured in 12 701 serum samples provided by 3213 KTRs. Vaccine response was assessed 41 [31–57] days after vaccination. A total of 1090 KTRs were infected with SARS-CoV-2, 1005 (92%) were BTI, and vaccine response did not protect against BTI. The hazard ratio for COVID-19 related death 40 days post-infection was 1.71 (95% CI: 1.14, 2.56) comparing vaccine response levels (≥5 vs. ≥5000 BAU/mL). No excess non-COVID-19 mortality was registered in KTRs surviving SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to a 2019 pre-pandemic reference.
Interpretation
Our findings suggested that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine response did not predict protection against infection, but prevention of fatal disease progression in KTRs and greater vaccine response further reduced the risk of COVID-19 death. No excess non-COVID-19 mortality was seen during the pandemic.

To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the relative risk of COVID-19-related mortality among people with disabilities compared to people without disabilities.
Study design
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods
We systematically searched four databases from March 1, 2020, to August 15, 2022. We included prospective studies with a baseline assessment of disability and a longitudinal assessment of the COVID-19-related mortality. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook random-effects meta-analyses to calculate pooled adjusted hazard ratios for COVID-19-related mortality for people with disabilities, also disaggregated by disability type and study setting.
Results
We identified 2596 articles throughout the electronic data search, and 56 studies were included in the review. Most (73%) had a moderate risk of bias. The pooled adjusted effect estimate for COVID-19-related mortality in people with disabilities compared to those without was 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4–3.2). Heterogeneity between the studies was high (τ2 = 0.28, I2 = 97%). Effect estimates were highest for population-based samples (3.3, 95% CI: 2.7–3.9), compared to hospital settings (2.1, 95% CI: 1.7–2.7). Risk was not elevated among people with disabilities in care home settings (1.6, 95% CI: 0.7–3.5). Disaggregation by disability type showed that people with intellectual disabilities were at the highest relative risk of COVID-19 mortality.
Discussion
Risk of COVID-19 mortality is elevated among people with disabilities, especially people with intellectual disabilities. Efforts are needed to collect better routine data on disability and to include people with disabilities in the pandemic response for COVID-19.

AB  - Brazil was one of the countries most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a cumulative total of nearly 700,000 deaths by early 2023. The country's federative units were unevenly affected by the pandemic and adopted mitigation measures of different scopes and intensity. There was intense conflict between the federal government and state governments over the relevance and extent of such measures. We build a simple regression model with good predictive power on state COVID-19 mortality rates in Brazil. Our results reveal that the federative units' urbanization rate and per capita income are important for determining their mean mortality rate and that the number of physicians per 100,000 inhabitants is important for modeling the mortality rate precision. Based on the fitted model, we obtain approximations for the levels of administrative efficiency of local governments in dealing with the pandemic.

AB  - Background
Critical questions remain regarding the need for intensity to continue NPIs as the public was vaccinated. We evaluated the association of intensity and duration of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccines with COVID-19 infection, death, and excess mortality in Europe.
Methods
Data comes from Our Word in Data. We included 22 European countries from January 20, 2020, to May 30, 2021. The time-varying constrained distribution lag model was used in each country to estimate the impact of different intensities and duration of NPIs on COVID-19 control, considering vaccination coverage. Country-specific effects were pooled through meta-analysis.
Results
This study found that high-intensity and long-duration of NPIs showed a positive main effect on reducing infection in the absence of vaccines, especially in the intensity above the 80th percentile and lasted for 7 days (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.89–0.98). However, the adverse effect on excess mortality also increased with the duration and intensity. Specifically, it was associated with an increase of 44.16% (RR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.27–1.64) in the excess mortality under the strict intervention (the intensity above the 80th percentile and lasted for 21 days). As the vaccine rollouts, the inhibition of the strict intervention on cases growth rate was increased (RR dropped from 0.95 to 0.87). Simultaneously, vaccination also alleviated the negative impact of the strict intervention on excess mortality (RR decreased from 1.44 to 1.25). Besides, maintaining the strict intervention appeared to more reduce the cases, as well as avoids more overall burden of death compared with weak intervention.
Conclusions
Our study highlights the importance of continued high-intensity NPIs in low vaccine coverage. Lifting of NPIs in insufficient vaccination coverage may cause increased infections and death burden. Policymakers should coordinate the intensity and duration of NPIs and allocate medical resources reasonably with widespread vaccination.

AB  - Summary
Background
Official death toll related to COVID-19 has been considerably underestimated in reports from some Latin American countries. This study aimed to analyze the mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Costa Rica between March 2020 and December 2021.
Methods
A registry based study based on 2017–2021 data from the National Institute of Statistics and Census was designed (N = 128,106). Excess deaths were defined by the WHO as “the difference in the total number of deaths in a crisis compared to those expected under normal conditions”; and were estimated using a Poisson regression, and mortality and years of potential life lost (YPLL) rates were calculated.
Findings
The COVID-19 pandemic represented 15% of the deaths in Costa Rica between March 2020 and December 2021. The mortality rate related to COVID-19 was 83 per 100,000 person-years. Between March and July 2020 (low-incidence period), observed number of deaths was 9%-lower than expected, whereas it was 15% and 24% higher than expected between July 2020 and March 2021 (high incidence period - no vaccination), and between March 2021 and December 2021 (high incidence period – progressive vaccination) respectively. Between July 2020 and December 2021, excess deaths observed and COVID-19 deaths reported were comparable (7461 and 7620 respectively). Nevertheless, there were more deaths than expected for conditions that predispose to COVID-19 deaths. YPLL and mortality rates increased with age, but significant excess deaths were observed in all age-groups older than 30–39 years. No large differences were noted by districts’ socioeconomic characteristics although excess death rate was lower in rural compared to urban areas.
Interpretation
Reporting of deaths was only slightly underestimated. In the pre-vaccination period, mortality rate and YPLL rates increased with age, being highest in people aged 60 years or older and justifying the decision to initially prioritize vaccination of older individuals.
Funding
The study was supported by the University of Costa Rica and the Agencia Costarricense de Investigaciones Biomédicas – Fundación Inciensa.

AB  - Purpose
COVID-19 vaccine uptake remains low for US adolescents and contributes to excess morbidity and mortality. Most research has assessed parental intention to vaccinate their children. We explored differences between vaccine-acceptant and vaccine-hesitant unvaccinated US adolescents using national survey data.
Methods
A nonprobability, quota-based sample of adolescents, aged 13–17 years, was recruited through an online survey panel in April 2021. One thousand nine hundred twenty seven adolescents were screened for participation and the final sample included 985 responses. We assessed responses from unvaccinated adolescents (n = 831). Our primary measure was COVID-19 vaccination intent (“vaccine-acceptant” defined as “definitely will” get a COVID-19 vaccine and any other response classified as “vaccine-hesitant”) and secondary measures included reasons for intending or not intending to get vaccinated and trusted sources of COVID-19 vaccine information. We calculated descriptive statistics and chi-square tests to explore differences between vaccine-acceptant and vaccine-hesitant adolescents.
Results
Most (n = 831; 70.9%) adolescents were hesitant, with more hesitancy observed among adolescents with low levels of concern about COVID-19 and high levels of concern about side effects of COVID-19 vaccination. Among vaccine-hesitant adolescents, reasons for not intending to get vaccinated included waiting for safety data and having parents who would make the vaccination decision. Vaccine-hesitant adolescents had a lower number of trusted information sources than vaccine-acceptant adolescents.
Discussion
Differences identified between vaccine-acceptant and vaccine-hesitant adolescents can inform message content and dissemination. Messages should include accurate, age-appropriate information about side effects and risks of COVID-19 infection. Prioritizing dissemination of these messages through family members, state and local government officials, and healthcare providers may be most effective.

AB  - COVID-19 vaccines have been available for over a year, yet 26% of U.S. young adults remain unvaccinated. This study examines racial and ethnic disparities in young adult vaccine hesitancy and attitudes/beliefs that mediate disparities in vaccine hesitancy. Young adults (n = 2041;Mean[SD]:21.3[0.7] years-old) from a Los Angeles, CA, USA cohort were surveyed online in January–May 2021 and classified as vaccine hesitant (those who reported “Not at all likely”/“Not very likely” /“Slightly likely” to get vaccinated) versus non-hesitant (those who reported “Moderately likely”/”Very likely”/”Definitely likely” to get vaccinated or already vaccinated). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine racial/ethnic disparities in vaccine hesitancy. Factor analysis was conducted to create three subscales toward vaccination: positive, negative, and lack-of-access beliefs. Mediation analyses were performed to assess pathways from attitude/belief subscales to racial disparities in vaccine hesitancy. Overall 33.0% of respondents reported vaccine hesitancy. Black vs. White young adults had a higher prevalence of vaccine hesitancy (AOR[95%CI] = 4.3[2.4–7.8]), and Asians vs. Whites had a lower prevalence (AOR[95%CI] = 0.5[0.3–0.8]). Mediators explained 90% of the Black (vs. White) disparity in vaccine hesitancy, including significant indirect effects through positive belief–reducing (β = 0.23,p < .001) and negative belief–enhancing (β = 0.02,p = .04) effects. About 81% of the Asian (vs. White) disparity in vaccine hesitancy was explained by the three combined subscales, including significant positive belief–reducing (β = −0.18,p < .001) indirect effect. Substantial racial and ethnic disparities in young adult COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were found, which were mediated by differences in attitudes and beliefs toward vaccination. Targeted education campaigns and messages are needed to promote equitable utilization of the effective vaccine.

AB  - Objectives
In addition to being home to more than seven million HIV-infected individuals, South Africa also has a high burden of COVID-19 and related comorbidities worldwide. We aimed to identify the most influential “beliefs” and “attitudes” on vaccine decision-making behavior.
Study design
This study used panel data from cross-sectional surveys.
Methods
We used the data from Black South Africans who participated in the “COVID-19 Vaccine Surveys” (November 2021 and February/March 2022) in South Africa. Besides standard risk factor analysis, such as multivariable logistic regression models, we also used the modified version of population attributable risk percent and estimated the population-level impacts of beliefs and attitudes on vaccine decision-making behavior using the methodology in multifactorial setting.
Results
A total of 1399 people (57% men and 43% women) who participated in both surveys were analyzed. Of these, 336 (24%) reported being vaccinated in survey 2. Overall low perceived risk, concerns around efficacy, and safety were identified as the most influential factors and associated with 52%–72% (<40 years) and 34%–55% (40+ years) of the unvaccinated individuals.
Conclusion
Our findings highlighted the most influential beliefs and attitudes on vaccine decision-making and their population-level impacts, which are likely to have significant public health implications exclusively for this population.

AB  - Summary
Background
During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, workers in essential sectors had higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mortality than those in non-essential sectors. It is unknown whether disparities in pandemic-related mortality across occupational sectors have continued to occur during the periods of SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccine availability.
Methods
In this longitudinal cohort study, we obtained data from the California Department of Public Health on all deaths occurring in the state of California, USA, from Jan 1, 2016, to Dec 31, 2021. We restricted our analysis to residents of California who were aged 18–65 years at time of death and died of natural causes. We classified the occupational sector into nine essential sectors; non-essential; or unemployed or without an occupation provided on the death certificate. We calculated the number of COVID-19 deaths in total and per capita that occurred in each occupational sector. Separately, using autoregressive integrated moving average models, we estimated total, per-capita, and relative excess natural-cause mortality by week between March 1, 2020, and Nov 30, 2021, stratifying by occupational sector. We additionally stratified analyses of occupational risk into counties with high versus low vaccine uptake, categorising high-uptake regions as counties where at least 50% of the population were fully vaccinated according to US guidelines by Aug 1, 2021.
Findings
From March 1, 2020, to Nov 30, 2021, 24 799 COVID-19 deaths were reported in residents of California aged 18–65 years and an estimated 28 751 (95% prediction interval 27 853–29 653) excess deaths. People working in essential sectors were associated with higher COVID-19 deaths and excess deaths than were those working in non-essential sectors, with the highest per-capita COVID-19 mortality in the agriculture (131·8 per 100 000 people), transportation or logistics (107·1 per 100 000), manufacturing (103·3 per 100 000), facilities (101·1 per 100 000), and emergency (87·8 per 100 000) sectors. Disparities were wider during periods of increased infections, including during the Nov 29, 2020, to Feb 27, 2021, surge in infections, which was driven by the delta variant (B.1.617.2) and occurred during vaccine uptake. During the June 27 to Nov 27, 2021 surge, emergency workers had higher COVID-19 mortality (113·7 per 100 000) than workers from any other sector. Workers in essential sectors had the highest COVID-19 mortality in counties with low vaccination uptake, a difference that was more pronounced during the period of the delta infection surge during Nov 29, 2020, to Feb 27, 2021.
Interpretation
Workers in essential sectors have continued to bear the brunt of high COVID-19 and excess mortality throughout the pandemic, particularly in the agriculture, emergency, manufacturing, facilities, and transportation or logistics sectors. This high death toll has continued during periods of vaccine availability and the delta surge. In an ongoing pandemic without widespread vaccine coverage and with anticipated threats of new variants, the USA must actively adopt policies to more adequately protect workers in essential sectors.

AB  - Background
Information about Cameroonians’ views toward coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and amenability to receiving a vaccine is emerging. Learning more about Cameroonians’ vaccine perspectives could guide prevention messaging and facilitate optimal communication modalities.
Objectives
The primary objective of this study was to analyze the willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine among Cameroonians, pending availability. The secondary objectives were to assess perceptions of COVID-19’s origin and to gauge views toward government-mandated vaccinations.
Methods
An 11-item questionnaire queried Cameroonians in-person and online, from March through May 2021, about their demographics and whether they believed that COVID-19 was man-made, whether COVID-19 vaccinations should be governmentally mandated, and whether they would receive a COVID-19 vaccine, if available. A free-text option inviting rationales for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was included. In-person participation took place on the grounds of St. Louis University in Douala, Cameroon, and was restricted to participants lacking Internet access or electronic mobile devices. Online participation included use of an electronic link that contained questionnaire content located within Google Forms.
Results
A total of 591 respondents participated by replying to at least 8 items on the questionnaire, 386 online and 205 in-person. Over 80% stated that they previously received a seasonal influenza vaccine. Roughly, 87% reported unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, if available. Approximately 95% of respondents disagreed with governmental mandates on COVID-19 vaccinations. About 75% attributed COVID-19 to man-made as opposed to natural beginnings. Seven respondents’ free-text comments cited lacking confidence in a COVID-19 vaccine, discriminatory COVID-19 vaccine distribution patterns in other parts of the world relative to Africa, and improper COVID-19 vaccine approval timeline.
Conclusion
Raising awareness of COVID-19 misconceptions and barriers to vaccine acceptance is integral to accomplishing immunization goals. Cameroonians’ pessimism in this study toward COVID-19 vaccination was multifaceted. Our findings signal a need for additional research that requests more qualitative insights, for example, interviews, focus groups, into vaccine aversion.

AB  - Objective
To investigate the patterns and demographic features of cardiovascular disease (CVD) death and subtypes myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and heart failure in the pre–COVID-19 era (2018-2019) vs during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) in the United States.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, we used the US Multiple Cause of Death files for 2018 to 2021 to examine the trend of excess cause-specific deaths using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes for CVD (I00 to I99), MI (I21 and I22), stroke (I60 to I69), and heart failure (I42 and I50). Our primary outcome was excess mortality from CVD and its 3 subtypes (MI, stroke, and heart failure) between prepandemic (2018-2019) and pandemic (2020-2021) years. We performed a subgroup analysis on race and month-to-month and year-to-year variation using χ2 analysis to test statistical significance.
Results
Overall, 3,598,352 CVD deaths were analyzed during the study period. There was a 6.7% excess CVD mortality, 2.5% MI mortality, and 8.5% stroke mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) compared with the prepandemic era (2018-2019). Black individuals had higher excess CVD mortality (13.8%) than White individuals (5.1%; P<.001). This remained consistent across subtypes of CVD, including MI (9.6% vs 1.0%; P<.001), stroke (14.5% vs 6.9%; P<.001), and heart failure (5.1% vs −1.2%; P<.001).
Conclusion
There has been a significant rise in CVD and subtype-specific mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic that has been persistent despite 2 years since the onset of the pandemic. Excess CVD mortality has disproportionately affected Black compared with White individuals. Further studies targeting and eliminating health care disparities are necessary.

AB  - Background
Myocarditis secondary to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination has been reported in the literature.
Objective
This study aimed to characterize the reported cases of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination based on age, gender, doses, and vaccine type from published literature and the EudraVigilance database.
Methods
We performed an analysis in the EudraVigilance database (until December 18, 2021) and a systematic review of published literature for reported cases of suspected myocarditis and pericarditis (until 30th June 2022) after the COVID-19 vaccination.
Results
EudraVigilance database analysis revealed 16,514 reported cases of myocarditis or pericarditis due to the vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines. The cases of myo- or pericarditis were reported predominantly in the age group of 18–64 (n = 12,214), and in males with a male-to-female (M: F) ratio of 1.7:1. The mortality among myocarditis patients was low, with 128 deaths (2 cases per 10.000.000 administered doses) being reported. For the systematic review, 72 studies with 1026 cases of myocarditis due to the vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines were included. The analysis of published cases has revealed that the male gender was primarily affected with myocarditis post-COVID-vaccination. The median (IQR) age of the myocarditis cases was 24.6 [19.5–34.6] years, according to the systematic review of the literature. Myocarditis cases were most frequently published after the vaccination with m-RNA vaccines and after the second vaccination dose. The overall mortality of published cases was low (n = 5).
Conclusion
Myocarditis is a rare serious adverse event associated with a COVID-19 vaccination. With early recognition and management, the prognosis of COVID-19 vaccine-induced myocarditis is favorable.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly pathogenic and transmissible virus. Infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 known as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be severe, especially among high risk populations affected of underlying medical conditions. COVID-19 is characterized by the severe acute respiratory syndrome, a hyper inflammatory syndrome, vascular injury, microangiopathy and thrombosis. Antiviral drugs and immune modulating methods has been evaluated. So far, a particular therapeutic option has not been approved for COVID-19 and a variety of treatments have been studied for COVID-19 including, current treatment such as oxygen therapy, corticosteroids, antiviral agents until targeted therapy and vaccines which are diverse in each patient and have various outcomes. According to the findings of different in vitro and in vivo studies, some novel approach such as gene editing, cell based therapy, and immunotherapy may have significant potential in the treatment of COVID-19. Based on these findings, this paper aims to review the different strategies of treatment against COVID-19 and provide a summary from traditional and newer methods in curing COVID-19.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic in the US has been particularly devastating for nursing home residents. A key question is how have some nursing homes been able to effectively protect their residents, while others have not? Using data on the universe of US nursing homes, we examine whether establishment quality is predictive of COVID-19 mortality. Higher-quality nursing homes, as measured by CMS overall five-star rating, have substantially lower COVID-19 mortality through September of 2020. Quality does not predict the ability to prevent any COVID-19 resident or staff cases, but higher-quality establishments prevent the spread of resident infections conditional on having one. Preventing COVID-19 cases and deaths may come at some cost, as high-quality homes have substantially higher non-COVID deaths. The positive correlation between establishment quality and non-COVID mortality is strong enough that high-quality homes also have more total deaths than their low-quality counterparts and this relationship has grown with time. As of late April 2021, five-star homes have experienced 8.4 percent more total deaths than one-star homes.

We aimed to determine how municipal subsidies for seasonal influenza vaccines for the elderly affected vaccination coverage and health outcomes and how responses to vaccine prices changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Study design and methods
This ecological study includes 1245 municipalities in Japan between 2019 and 2020. Fixed-effects regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of influenza vaccine cost subsidy for people aged 65 years or older on vaccination coverage, all-cause mortality, and influenza-related mortality.
Results
The vaccination rate increased when patients' copayments decreased, and reducing the copayment by 1000 Japanese Yen (JPY) was estimated to increase the vaccination rate by 6.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.5–8.2%) in the adjusted model. When examining the additional effect of a zero price compared to a nearly zero price, we found that a zero price increased the immunization rate by 6.4% (95% CI 1.4–11.5%). The effect of copayment on the increase in vaccination coverage was significantly lower during the pandemic than in the pre-pandemic period. The municipal and prefectural analyses found no association between influenza vaccine copayments and all-cause, influenza, or pneumonia mortality.
Conclusion
Cost subsidies and the zero-price effect were shown to increase vaccination coverage but were not associated with relevant mortality measures. Although the impact was attenuated under pandemic conditions, cost subsidy effectively increases the vaccination rate.

AB  - Objectives
We investigated hospitalization and hospital mortality rates by cause during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Quebec, Canada.
Study design
Interrupted time series and decomposition analysis.
Methods
We analyzed hospital mortality during the first (February 25–August 22, 2020) and second waves (August 23, 2020–March 31, 2021), compared with 2019. We identified the cause of death and examined trends using: 1) interrupted time series analysis; 2) log-binomial regression; and 3) decomposition of cause-specific mortality.
Results
Hospitalization rates decreased; however, the proportion of deaths increased from 27.0 per 1000 in 2019 to 35.0 per 1000 in the first wave, for an excess of 8.0 deaths per 1000 admissions. COVID-19 was the cause of a third of excess deaths (2.6 per 1000). Other drivers of excess deaths included respiratory conditions (1.6 deaths per 1000), circulatory disorders (0.6 deaths per 1000), and cancer (0.9 deaths per 1000). COVID-19 was the cause of 58% of excess deaths in the second wave. Interrupted time series regression indicated that the proportion of deaths increased at the outset of the first wave but returned to prepandemic levels before increasing again in the second wave. Compared with 2019, the first wave was associated with 1.31 times (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28–1.33) and the second wave with 1.17 times (95% CI 1.15–1.19) the risk of death during hospitalization.
Conclusions
The pandemic was associated with a greater risk of hospital mortality. Excess deaths were driven by COVID-19 but also other causes, including respiratory conditions, circulatory disorders, and cancer.

AB  - Introduction
Amyloidosis is a rare disease in which malformed proteins are deposited in tissues occurring mostly commonly in older age. These deposits can lead to severe organ dysfunction e.g. in the myocardium with great impact on prognosis. The Covid-19 pandemic has caused excess mortality worldwide since 2020. Risk factors for a severe course include pre-existing cardiac diseases like heart failure and advanced age. Therefore, vaccination against Sars-CoV2 viruses is highly recommended for patients with cardiac amyloidosis. However, since there are no specific data on mRNA vaccines in patients with cardiac amyloidosis, some patients have concerns about cardiac adverse events following immunization (AEFI), such as myocarditis.
Purpose
The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines in patients with cardiac amyloidosis.
Methods
Patients of the Amyloidosis Center Charité Berlin (ACCB) were assessed about the vaccination, its tolerability and clinical effectiveness. To date, we included 62 patients (54 men) with a median age of 82,5 years (range 37 to 92). 46 patients had wtATTR amyloidosis, ten patients had hATTR amyloidosis, and six patients had AL amyloidosis. The mean systolic left ventricular function was 51% (range 30 to 62) with a mean global strain of −11,5% (range −18,5 to −3,1). The mean NT-pro-BNP was 1145 ng/l (range 24 to 48297).
Results
59 patients were triple vaccinated and three patients so far are double vaccinated. Three of the patients were unvaccinated. 171 of the vaccine doses administered were mRNA vaccines and eight doses were a viral vector-vaccine. None of the patients reported severe side effects. Thirteen patients reported feeling of pressure and pain at the injection site after vaccination and four patients had fever of maximum two days, eight patients reported lower general condition of maximum five days. One patient reported malaise for 14 days after each vaccination, which resolved spontaneously. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of suspected vaccine-induced myocarditis. Five patients reported of a COVID-19 breakthrough infection, all of which with a mild course of disease. None of the patients had symptoms of worsening heart failure in temporal relation to the vaccination. Most of the vaccinations (103) were performed at an official vaccination center, 59 were performed at a general practitioner.
Conclusion
In patients with cardiac amyloidosis, mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 are safe with respect to severe cardiac adverse events and show effective protection against clinically relevant SARS-CoV2 infection.

AB  - Background: Vaccination against COVID-19 in Brazil started in January 2021, with health workers and the elderly as the priority groups. We assessed whether there was an impact of vaccinations on the mortality of elderly individuals in a context of wide transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 gamma (P.1) variant. Methods: By May 15, 2021, 238,414 COVID-19 deaths had been reported to the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Denominators for mortality rates were calculated by correcting population estimates for all-cause deaths reported in 2020. Proportionate mortality at ages 70–79 and 80+ years relative to deaths at all ages were calculated for deaths due to COVID-19 and to other causes, as were COVID-19 mortality rate ratios relative to individuals aged 0–69 years. Vaccine coverage data were obtained from the Ministry of Health. All results were tabulated by epidemiological weeks 1–19, 2021. Findings: The proportion of all COVID-19 deaths at ages 80+ years was over 25% in weeks 1–6 and declined rapidly to 12.4% in week 19, whereas proportionate COVID-19 mortality for individuals aged 70–79 years started to decline by week 15. Trends in proportionate mortality due to other causes remained stable. Mortality rates were over 13 times higher in the 80+ years age group compared to that of 0–69 year olds up to week 6, and declined to 5.0 times in week 19. Vaccination coverage (first dose) of 90% was reached by week 9 for individuals aged 80+ years and by week 13 for those aged 70–79 years. Coronavac accounted for 65.4% and AstraZeneca for 29.8% of all doses administered in weeks 1–4, compared to 36.5% and 53.3% in weeks 15–19, respectively. Interpretation: Rapid scaling up of vaccination coverage among elderly Brazilians was associated with important declines in relative mortality compared to younger individuals, in a setting where the gamma variant predominates. Had mortality rates among the elderly remained proportionate to what was observed up to week 6, an estimated additional 43,802 COVID-related deaths would have been expected up to week 19. Funding: CGV and AJDB are funded by the Todos pela Saúde (São Paulo, Brazil) initiative.

AB  - Background
It is evident that COVID-19 will remain a public health concern in the coming years, largely driven by variants of concern (VOC). It is critical to continuously monitor vaccine effectiveness as new variants emerge and new vaccines and/or boosters are developed. Systematic surveillance of the scientific evidence base is necessary to inform public health action and identify key uncertainties. Evidence syntheses may also be used to populate models to fill in research gaps and help to prepare for future public health crises. This protocol outlines the rationale and methods for a living evidence synthesis of the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with, and transmission of, VOC of SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
Living evidence syntheses of vaccine effectiveness will be carried out over one year for (1) a range of potential outcomes in the index individual associated with VOC (pathogenesis); and (2) transmission of VOC. The literature search will be conducted up to May 2023. Observational and database-linkage primary studies will be included, as well as RCTs. Information sources include electronic databases (MEDLINE; Embase; Cochrane, L*OVE; the CNKI and Wangfang platforms), pre-print servers (medRxiv, BiorXiv), and online repositories of grey literature. Title and abstract and full-text screening will be performed by two reviewers using a liberal accelerated method. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be completed by one reviewer with verification of the assessment by a second reviewer. Results from included studies will be pooled via random effects meta-analysis when appropriate, or otherwise summarized narratively.
Discussion
Evidence generated from our living evidence synthesis will be used to inform policy making, modelling, and prioritization of future research on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against VOC.

AB  - Background
There have been concerns about COVID-19 vaccination safety among frail older individuals. We investigated the relationship between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and mortality among individuals aged ≥ 70 years and whether mortality varies across four groups of health services used.
Methods
In this nationwide cohort study, we included 688,152 individuals aged ≥ 70 years at the start of the Norwegian vaccination campaign (December 27, 2020). We collected individual-level data from theNorwegian Emergency Preparedness Register for COVID-19. Vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were matched (1:1 ratio) on the date of vaccination based on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. The main outcome was all-cause mortality during 21 days after first dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. Kaplan-Meier survival functions were estimated for the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. We used Cox proportional-hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of death between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), overall and by use of health services (none, home-based, short- and long-term nursing homes) and age group.
Results
Between December 27, 2020, and March 31, 2021, 420,771 older individuals (61.1%) were vaccinated against COVID-19. The Kaplan-Meier estimates based on the matched study sample showed a small absolute risk difference in all-cause mortality between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, with a lower mortality in the vaccinated group (overall HR 0.28 [95% CI: 0.24–0.31]). Similar results were obtained in analyses stratified by use of health services and age group.
Conclusion
We found no evidence of increased short-term mortality among vaccinated individuals in the older population after matching on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics affecting vaccination and mortality.

AB  - Background
Studies have reported evidence about the effectiveness of a third dose with BNT162b2 for preventing hospitalization and death by COVID-19. However, there is little evidence regarding other primary vaccine schedules such as BBIBP-CorV and ChAdOx1-S. We estimated the relative vaccine effectiveness (RVE) of the booster dose versus the primary regimens of COVID-19 vaccines based on BBIBP-CorV, ChAdOx1-S, or BNT162b2 for preventing death during the Omicron wave in Peruvian adult people.
Methods
We carried out a nested case-control study with a risk set sampling of controls using data from Peru between December 20, 2021, and February 20, 2022 (during the Omicron wave). Data on vaccination, COVID-19 tests and deaths were collected from national surveillance databases. We performed conditional logistic regression models to estimate the RVE on the adult population. In addition, we executed sub-group analysis per age group (18 to 59 years, and 60 years or more) and per primary regime (based on BNT162b2, BBIBP-CorV, or ChAdOx1-S).
Results
Of the 11,188,332 people eligible to enter the study 1,974 met the case definition (death from COVID-19) and were matched to 9,183 controls. The overall RVE of a third dose to prevent death was 87.2% (84.2%-89.7%), which varied according to the primary regime (87.3% for BNT162b2, 82.0% for BBIPB-CorV-2, and 79.5% for ChAdOx-S). In older adults, the RVE was 87.1%, without significant variations according to the primary regime (86.1% for BNT162b2, 86.1 for BBIBP-CorV, and 82% for ChAdOx-S).
Conclusions
The booster) dose of vaccine against COVID-19 had a high RVE for preventing death by COVID-19 in the Peruvian population in all primary regimes of vaccines during the Omicron wave. This effect was consistent in people over 60 years of age, the group most vulnerable to die from this infection.

AB  - Background
The safety of COVID-19 vaccines plays an important role in addressing vaccine hesitancy. We conducted a large cohort study to evaluate the risk of non-COVID-19 mortality after COVID-19 vaccination while adjusting for confounders including individual-level demographics, clinical risk factors, health care utilization, and community-level socioeconomic risk factors.
Methods
The retrospective cohort study consisted of members from seven Vaccine Safety Datalink sites from December 14, 2020 through August 31, 2021. We conducted three separate analyses for each of the three COVID-19 vaccines used in the US. Crude non-COVID-19 mortality rates were reported by vaccine type, age, sex, and race/ethnicity. The counting process model for survival analyses was used to analyze non-COVID-19 mortality where a new observation period began when the vaccination status changed upon receipt of the first dose and the second dose. We used calendar time as the basic time scale in survival analyses to implicitly adjust for season and other temporal trend factors. A propensity score approach was used to adjust for the potential imbalance in confounders between the vaccinated and comparison groups.
Results
For each vaccine type and across age, sex, and race/ethnicity groups, crude non-COVID-19 mortality rates among COVID-19 vaccinees were lower than those among comparators. After adjusting for confounders with the propensity score approach, the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were 0.46 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44–0.49) after dose 1 and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.46–0.50) after dose 2 of the BNT162b2 vaccine, 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39–0.44) after dose 1 and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.37–0.40) after dose 2 of the mRNA-1273 vaccine, and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.51–0.59) after receipt of Ad26.COV2.S.
Conclusion
While residual confounding bias remained after adjusting for several individual-level and community-level risk factors, no increased risk was found for non-COVID-19 mortality among recipients of three COVID-19 vaccines used in the US.

AB  - Objectives
Elderly patients with hematologic malignancies face the highest risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. The infection's impact on different age groups remains unstudied in detail.
Methods
We analyzed elderly patients (age groups: 65-70, 71-75, 76-80, and >80 years old) with hematologic malignancies included in the EPICOVIDEHA registry between January 2020 and July 2022. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were conducted to identify factors influencing death in COVID-19 patients with hematological malignancy.
Results
The study included data from 3,603 elderly patients (aged 65 or older) with hematological malignancy, with a majority being male (58.1%) and a significant proportion having comorbidities. The patients were divided into four age groups, and the analysis assessed COVID-19 outcomes, vaccination status, and other variables in relation to age and pandemic waves. The 90-day survival rate for patients with COVID-19 was 71.2%, with significant differences between groups. The pandemic waves had varying impacts, with the first wave affecting patients over 80 years old, the second being more severe in 65-70, and the third being the least severe in all age groups. Factors contributing to 90-day mortality included age, comorbidities, lymphopenia, active malignancy, acute leukemia, less than three vaccine doses, severe COVID-19, and using only corticosteroids as treatment.
Conclusion
These data underscore the heterogeneity of elderly hematological patients, highlight the different impacts of COVID-19 waves and the pivotal importance of vaccination, and may help in planning future healthcare efforts.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the middle-aged population in the US. Leveraging the CDC dataset, this study quantifies the number of fatalities across various midlife age brackets, specifically 40–44, 45–49, 50–54, 55–59, and 60–64 for both males and females, spanning the years 2015 to 2020. A novel Python Package Index (PyPI) application, midlife was developed to compute and visualize these findings. The PyPI midlife application was also validated via Code Ocean for reproducibility of the application. The analysis revealed that males aged 55–59 and females aged 50–54 experienced the highest excess mortality due to COVID-19, likely due to a previously declining death trend in these groups. This research not only provides a method to visualize and calculate the impact of COVID-19 on midlife mortality by age and sex, but also highlights the potential economic repercussions of rising midlife mortality rates.

AB  - Objectives
To compare COVID-19-associated pulmonary mucormycosis (CAPM) with COVID-19-associated rhino-orbital mucormycosis (CAROM), ascertain factors associated with CAPM among patients with COVID-19, and identify factors associated with 12-week mortality in CAPM.
Methods
We performed a retrospective multicentre cohort study. All study participants had COVID-19. We enrolled CAPM, CAROM, and COVID-19 subjects without mucormycosis (controls; age-matched). We collected information on demography, predisposing factors, and details of COVID-19 illness. Univariable analysis was used to compare CAPM and CAROM. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with CAPM (with hypoxemia during COVID-19 as the primary exposure) and at 12-week mortality.
Results
We included 1724 cases (CAPM [n = 122], CAROM [n = 1602]) and 3911 controls. Male sex, renal transplantation, multimorbidity, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, intensive care admission, and cumulative glucocorticoid dose for COVID-19 were significantly higher in CAPM than in CAROM. On multivariable analysis, COVID-19-related hypoxemia (aOR, 2.384; 95% CI, 1.209–4.700), male sex, rural residence, diabetes mellitus, serum C-reactive protein, glucocorticoid, and zinc use during COVID-19 were independently associated with CAPM. CAPM reported a higher 12-week mortality than CAROM (56 of the 107 [52.3%] vs. 413 of the 1356 [30.5%]; p = 0.0001). Hypoxemia during COVID-19 (aOR [95% CI], 3.70 [1.34–10.25]) and Aspergillus co-infection (aOR [95% CI], 5.40 [1.23–23.64]) were independently associated with mortality in CAPM, whereas surgery was associated with better survival.
Discussion
CAPM is a distinct entity with a higher mortality than CAROM. Hypoxemia during COVID-19 illness is associated with CAPM. COVID-19 hypoxemia and Aspergillus co-infection were associated with higher mortality in CAPM.

AB  - The objective of this systematic review is to give a comprehensive interpretation of menstrual cycle changes after the COVID-19 vaccination. Additionally, it is imperative to assess reports of menstrual changes following vaccination to dispel concerns that COVID-19 vaccines hinder the likelihood of pregnancy in the long run. A literature review was conducted using digital databases to systematically identify the studies reporting any menstrual abnormalities after the COVID-19 vaccine. Detailed patient-level study characteristics including the type of study, sample size, administered vaccines, and menstrual abnormalities were abstracted. A total of 78 138 vaccinated females were included in this review from 14 studies. Of these, 39 759 (52.05%) had some form of a menstrual problem after vaccination. Due to the lack of published research articles, preprints were also included in this review. Menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and polymenorrhea were the most commonly observed problems and the overall study-level rate of menstrual abnormality ranged from 0.83% to 90.9%. Age, history of pregnancy, systemic side-effects of COVID-19, smoking, and second dose of COVID-19 vaccine were predictors of menstrual problems after vaccination.
Resumen
Alteraciones menstruales tras la vacunación contra la COVID-19: revisión sistemática Resumen El objetivo de esta revisión sistemática es aportar una interpretación amplia sobre los cambios de los ciclos menstruales tras la vacunación contra la COVID-19. Además, es imperativo evaluar los informes sobre los cambios menstruales tras la vacunación, para disipar preocupaciones en cuanto a que las vacunas contra la COVID-19 dificultan la probabilidad de embarazo a largo plazo. Se realizó una revisión de la literatura utilizando bases de datos digitales para identificar sistemáticamente los estudios que reportan cualquier alteración menstrual tras la vacuna contra la COVID-19. Se resumieron las características detalladas del estudio al nivel del paciente, incluyendo tipo de estudio, tamaño de la muestra, vacunas administradas, y alteraciones menstruales. Se incluyó en la revisión a un total de 78 138 mujeres vacunadas, procedentes de 14 estudios. De ellas, 39 759 (52,05%) tuvieron algún tipo de problema menstrual tras la vacunación. Debido a la falta de artículos de investigación publicados, también se incluyeron preimpresos en esta revisión. Menorragia, metrorragia, y polimenorrea fueron los problemas más comúnmente observados, oscilando la tasa global de alteraciones menstruales a nivel de estudios entre el 0,83 y el 90,9%. La edad, los antecedentes de embarazos, los efectos secundarios sistémicos de la COVID-19, el tabaquismo y la segunda dosis de la vacuna contra la COVID-19 fueron factores predictivos de problemas menstruales tras la vacunación.

AB  - Summary
Background
The effect of a fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccine on the risk of death in the oldest and frailest individuals is unknown.
Methods
Two matched cohorts were formed using Swedish nationwide registers. In the first, residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) given a fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine from 1 January 2022 onwards were matched 1:1 on birth year and county of residence to residents given at least a third dose (N = 24,524). In the second, all individuals aged ≥80 years given a fourth dose were matched 1:1 to individuals given at least a third dose (N = 394,104). Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in fourth-dose recipients as compared with in third-dose recipients, with relative vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimated as 1 minus the hazard ratio.
Findings
From 7 days after baseline and onwards, there were 1119 deaths in the LTCF cohort during a median follow-up of 77 days and a maximum follow-up of 126 days. During days 7 to 60, the VE of the fourth dose was 39% (95% CI, 29-48), which declined to 27% (95% CI, -2-48) during days 61 to 126. In the cohort of all individuals aged ≥80 years, there were 5753 deaths during a median follow-up of 73 days and a maximum follow-up of 143 days. During days 7 to 60, the VE of the fourth dose was 71% (95% CI, 69-72), which declined to 54% (95% CI, 48-60) during days 61 to 143. The VE of the fourth dose seemed stronger when it was compared to third-dose recipients where at least four months had passed since vaccination (P < 0·001 for interaction).
Interpretation
As compared with a third dose, a fourth dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, administered during the Omicron era, was associated with reduced risk of death from all causes in residents of LTCFs and in the oldest old during the first two months, after which the protection became slightly lower. These findings suggest that a fourth dose may prevent premature mortality in the oldest and frailest even after the emergence of the Omicron variant, although the timing of vaccination seems to be important with respect to the slight waning observed after two months.

AB  - Background & Aim
Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), specifically those treated with anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α biologics, are at high risk for vaccine-preventable infections. Their ability to mount adequate vaccine responses is unclear. The aim of the study was to assess serologic responses to messenger RNA–Coronavirus Disease 2019 vaccine, and safety profile, in patients with IBD stratified according to therapy, compared with healthy controls (HCs).
Methods
Prospective, controlled, multicenter Israeli study. Subjects enrolled received 2 BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) doses. Anti-spike antibody levels and functional activity, anti-TNFα levels and adverse events (AEs) were detected longitudinally.
Results
Overall, 258 subjects: 185 IBD (67 treated with anti-TNFα, 118 non–anti-TNFα), and 73 HCs. After the first vaccine dose, all HCs were seropositive, whereas ∼7% of patients with IBD, regardless of treatment, remained seronegative. After the second dose, all subjects were seropositive, however anti-spike levels were significantly lower in anti-TNFα treated compared with non–anti-TNFα treated patients, and HCs (both P < .001). Neutralizing and inhibitory functions were both lower in anti-TNFα treated compared with non–anti-TNFα treated patients, and HCs (P < .03; P < .0001, respectively). Anti-TNFα drug levels and vaccine responses did not affect anti-spike levels. Infection rate (∼2%) and AEs were comparable in all groups. IBD activity was unaffected by BNT162b2.
Conclusions
In this prospective study in patients with IBD stratified according to treatment, all patients mounted serologic response to 2 doses of BNT162b2; however, its magnitude was significantly lower in patients treated with anti-TNFα, regardless of administration timing and drug levels. Vaccine was safe. As vaccine serologic response longevity in this group may be limited, vaccine booster dose should be considered.

AB  - Recent studies have established the key individual-level risk factors of COVID-19 mortality such as age, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. However, the spread of infectious diseases is a spatial and temporal process implying that COVID-19 mortality and its determinants may vary sub-nationally and over time. We investigate the spatial patterns of age-standardised death rates due to COVID-19 and their correlates across local authority districts in England, Wales, and Scotland across three waves of infection. Using a Spatial Durbin model, we explore within- and between-country variation and account for spatial dependency. Areas with a higher share of ethnic minorities and higher levels of deprivation had higher rates of COVID-19 mortality. However, the share of ethnic minorities and population density in an area were more important predictors of COVID-19 mortality in earlier waves of the pandemic than in later waves, whereas area-level deprivation has become a more important predictor over time. Second, during the first wave of the pandemic, population density had a significant spillover effect on COVID-19 mortality, indicating that the pandemic spread from big cities to neighbouring areas. Third, after accounting for differences in ethnic composition, deprivation, and population density, initial cross-country differences in COVID-19 mortality almost disappeared. COVID-19 mortality remained higher in Scotland than in England and Wales in the third wave when COVID-19 mortality was relatively low in all three countries. Interpreting these results in the context of higher overall (long-term) non-COVID-19 mortality in Scotland suggests that Scotland may have performed better than expected during the first two waves. Our study highlights that accounting for both spatial and temporal factors is essential for understanding social and demographic risk factors of mortality during pandemics.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a tremendous global impact both socially and economically. The mechanisms behind the disparity in the severity, vaccine coverage, and variant replacement patterns across European countries are unclear. In this work, we aim to reveal the possible reasons via data visualization and model fitting. We developed a model with a vaccination component to simulate the mortality waves in these countries. Deaths averted by the vaccination campaign were estimated. Finally, we discuss the potential reasons behind the differences in vaccine coverage across European countries. Contemporary transportation and global trade bring significant convenience to our daily life but also facilitate the spread of the novel virus COVID-19 to anywhere globally within a short time. The observations and results in this work highlight the importance of the global campaign to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics under the One Health approach.

AB  - Summary
Background
In late 2022, the SARS-CoV-2 omicron (B.1.1.529) BA.5 sublineage accounted for most of the sequenced viral genomes worldwide. Bivalent mRNA vaccines contain an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain component plus an updated component of the omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sublineages. Since September, 2022, a single bivalent mRNA vaccine booster dose has been recommended for adults who have completed a primary SARS-CoV-2 vaccination series and are at high risk of severe COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a bivalent mRNA vaccine booster dose to reduce hospitalisations and deaths due to COVID-19.
Methods
We did a retrospective, population-based, cohort study in Israel, using data from electronic medical records in Clalit Health Services (CHS). We included all members of CHS who were aged 65 years or older and eligible for a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccination. We used hospital records to identify COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths. The primary endpoint was hospitalisation due to COVID-19, which we compared between participants who received a bivalent mRNA booster vaccination and those who did not. A Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-dependent covariates was used to estimate the association between the bivalent vaccine and hospitalisation due to COVID-19 while adjusting for demographic factors and coexisting illnesses.
Findings
Between Sept 27, 2022, and Jan 25, 2023, 569 519 eligible participants were identified. Of those, 134 215 (24%) participants received a bivalent mRNA booster vaccination during the study period. Hospitalisation due to COVID-19 occurred in 32 participants who received a bivalent mRNA booster vaccination and 541 who did not receive a bivalent booster vaccination (adjusted hazard ratio 0·28, 95% CI 0·19–0·40). The absolute risk reduction for hospitalisations due to COVID-19 in bivalent mRNA booster recipients versus non-recipients was 0·089% (95% CI 0·075–0·101), and the number needed to vaccinate to prevent one hospitalisation due to COVID-19 was 1118 people (95% CI 993–1341).
Interpretation
Participants who received a bivalent mRNA booster vaccine dose had lower rates of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 than participants who did not receive a bivalent booster vaccination, for up to 120 days after vaccination. These findings highlight the importance of bivalent mRNA booster vaccination in populations at high risk of severe COVID-19. Further studies with longer observation times are warranted.
Funding
None.

AB  - Rationale
Several authors have compared COVID-19 infection with influenza in the ICU.
Objective
This study aimed to compare the baseline clinical profiles, care procedures, and mortality outcomes of patients admitted to the intensive care unit, categorized by infection status (Influenza vs. COVID-19).
Methods
Retrospective observational study. Data were extracted from the Toulouse University Hospital from March 2014 to March 2021. To compare survival curves, we plotted the survival at Day-90 using the Kaplan-Meier curve and conducted a log-rank test. Additionally, we performed propensity score matching to adjust for confounding factors between the COVID-19 and influenza groups. Furthermore, we use the CART model for multivariate analysis.
Results
The study included 363 patients admitted to the ICU due to severe viral pneumonia: 152 patients (41.9 %) with influenza and 211 patients (58.1 %) with COVID-19. COVID-19 patients exhibited a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, whereas influenza patients had significantly higher severity scores (SOFA: 10 [6–12] vs. 6 [3–9], p<0.01 and SAPS II: 51 [35–67] vs. 37 [29–50], p<0.001). Overall mortality rates were comparable between the two groups (27.6 % (n = 42) in the influenza group vs. 21.8 % (n = 46) in the COVID-19 group, p=NS). Mechanical ventilation was more commonly employed in the influenza group (76.3 % (n = 116) vs. 59.7 % (n = 126), p<0.001); however, COVID-19 patients required longer durations of mechanical ventilation (18 [9–29] days vs. 13 [5–24] days, p<0.006) and longer hospital stays (23 [13–34] days vs. 18.5 [9–34.5] days, p = 0.009). The CART analysis revealed that the use of extra renal replacement therapy was the most influential prognostic factor in the influenza group, while the PaO2/FiO2-PEEP ratio played a significant role in the COVID-19 group.
Conclusions
Despite differences in clinical presentation and prognostic factors, the mortality rates at 90 days, after adjusting for confounding factors, were similar between COVID-19 and influenza patients.

AB  - Introduction
Novel strategies are needed to address barriers to COVID-19 vaccination among people experiencing homelessness (PEH), a population that faces increased COVID-19 risk. Although growing evidence suggests that financial incentives for vaccination are acceptable to PEH, their impact on uptake is unknown. This study aimed to assess whether offering $50 gift cards was associated with the uptake of the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine among PEH in Los Angeles County.
Methods
Vaccination clinics began on March 15, 2021; the financial incentive program was implemented from September 26, 2021 to April 30, 2022. Interrupted time-series analysis with quasi-Poisson regression was used to evaluate the level and slope change in the number of weekly first doses administered. Time-varying confounders included the weekly number of clinics and the weekly number of new cases. Demographic characteristics were compared for PEH vaccinated before and after the implementation of the incentive program using chi-square tests.
Results
Offering financial incentives was associated with the administration of 2.5 times (95% CI=1.8, 3.1) more first doses than would have been expected without the program. Level (–0.184, 95% CI= –1.166, –0.467) and slope change (0.042, 95% CI=0.031, 0.053) were observed. Individuals who were unsheltered, aged <55 years, and identified as Black or African American accounted for a higher percentage of those vaccinated during the post-intervention period than during the pre-intervention period.
Conclusions
Financial incentives may be an effective tool for increasing vaccine uptake among PEH, but important ethical considerations must be made to avoid coercion of vulnerable populations.

AB  - The aim of this study is to provide basic information that contributes to vaccine inoculation policy after COVID-19. We used the secondary data of the influenza vaccine inoculation behavior survey for community-dwelling adults conducted in 2011, before the COVID-19 pandemic, but after the 2009 novel influenza A (H1N1) pdm 09 pandemic. All factors such as socio-demographic characteristics, health-related behaviors, family environment, physical and social environment, and area of residence were adjusted, and factors related to vaccine inoculation behavior were analyzed. Those living with pregnant women had a significantly higher odds ratio of inoculation; this was self-evident in that those people considered infection to their family. Regarding the social environment, those aged 20–64 years with a significantly higher adjusted odds ratio of inoculation were those with “at least five people with which they interacted in the neighborhood”. This result can be interpreted in two ways relating to altruism in Japan. Finally, we indicated the importance of learning from the past, including the case of 2009.

AB  - Excess mortality has been used to measure the impact of COVID-19 over time and across countries. But what baseline should be chosen? We propose two novel approaches: an alternative retrospective baseline derived from the lowest weekly death rates achieved in previous years and a within-year baseline based on the average of the 13 lowest weekly death rates within the same year. These baselines express normative levels of the lowest feasible target death rates. The excess death rates calculated from these baselines are not distorted by past mortality peaks and do not treat non-pandemic winter mortality excesses as inevitable. We obtained weekly series for 35 industrialized countries from the Human Mortality Database for 2000–2020. Observed, baseline and excess mortalities were measured by age-standardized death rates. We assessed weekly and annual excess death rates driven by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and those related to seasonal respiratory infections in earlier years. There was a distinct geographic pattern with high excess death rates in Eastern Europe followed by parts of the UK, and countries of Southern and Western Europe. Some Asia-Pacific and Scandinavian countries experienced lower excess mortality. In 2020 and earlier years, the alternative retrospective and the within-year excess mortality figures were higher than estimates based on conventional metrics. While the latter were typically negative or close to zero in years without extraordinary epidemics, the alternative estimates were substantial. Cumulation of this "usual" excess over 2–3 years results in human losses comparable to those caused by COVID-19. Challenging the view that non-pandemic seasonal winter mortality is inevitable would focus attention on reducing premature mortality in many countries. As SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be the last respiratory pathogen with the potential to cause a pandemic, such measures would also strengthen global resilience in the face of similar threats in the future.

AB  - Objectives
To analyze how the vaccines and various measures to control the pandemic affected epidemiological, health and socioeconomic outcomes of COVID-19 in Finland. The focus of the analysis is on the endemic phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
The paper provides an overview of Finland's healthcare system, trends in COVID-19 morbidity, mortality and vaccination coverage data, political considerations, interventions to control the pandemic, as well as the economic impact of the pandemic in the endemic phase. Data were collected from various sources, including previous studies, government reports, national statistics and registers and general media.
Results
In Finland, the total number of COVID-19 infections increased significantly during 2022, but the number of serious forms of the disease decreased. The implementation of the vaccination strategy caused a diversity of opinions among authorities and experts. The governing of the pandemic was fully decentralized. Overall, there is a good vaccination coverage of the population. In the endemic phase society returned to live without restrictions.
Conclusions
It seems clear that vaccines played an important role in controlling the pandemic. Overall mortality increased substantially in 2022 causing life expectancy to fall. Moreover, different “excess death” indicators show an increase in 2021 and 2022, but the timing and magnitude of the effect varies. It is relatively safe to conclude that at least part of increase can be attributed to the pandemic, but a more exact conclusion calls for a comprehensive study. Similarly, understanding long covid and designing required intervention calls for more research.

AB  - Background
It has been claimed that COVID-19 vaccination is associated with excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic, a claim that contributes to vaccine hesitancy. We examined whether all-cause mortality has actually increased in Cyprus during the first two pandemic years, and whether any increases are associated with vaccination rates.
Methods
We calculated weekly excess mortality for Cyprus between January 2020 and June 2022, overall and by age group, using both a Distributed Lag Nonlinear Model (DLNM) adjusted for mean daily temperature, and the EuroMOMO algorithm. Excess deaths were regressed on the weekly number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths and on weekly first-dose vaccinations, also using a DLNM to explore the lag-response dimension.
Results
552 excess deaths were observed in Cyprus during the study period (95% CI: 508–597) as opposed to 1306 confirmed COVID-19 deaths. No association between excess deaths and vaccination rates was found overall and for any age group except 18–49 years, among whom 1.09 excess deaths (95% CI: 0.27–1.91) per 10,000 vaccinations were estimated during the first 8 weeks post-vaccination. However, detailed cause-of-death examination identified just two such deaths potentially linked to vaccination, therefore this association is spurious and attributable to random error.
Conclusions
Excess mortality was moderately increased in Cyprus during the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily as a result of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths. No relationship was found between vaccination rates and all-cause mortality, demonstrating the excellent safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - Background
Vaccines are critical cost-effective tools to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the emergence of variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may threaten the global impact of mass vaccination campaigns.
Aims
The objective of this study was to provide an up-to-date comparative analysis of the characteristics, adverse events, efficacy, effectiveness and impact of the variants of concern for 19 COVID-19 vaccines.
Sources
References for this review were identified through searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, regulatory drug agencies and pharmaceutical companies' websites up to 22nd September 2021.
Content
Overall, all COVID-19 vaccines had a high efficacy against the original strain and the variants of concern, and were well tolerated. BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 and Sputnik V after two doses had the highest efficacy (>90%) in preventing symptomatic cases in phase III trials. mRNA vaccines, AZD1222, and CoronaVac were effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and severe infections against Alpha, Beta, Gamma or Delta variants. Regarding observational real-life data, full immunization with mRNA vaccines and AZD1222 seems to effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection against the original strain and Alpha and Beta variants but with reduced effectiveness against the Delta strain. A decline in infection protection was observed at 6 months for BNT162b2 and AZD1222. Serious adverse event rates were rare for mRNA vaccines—anaphylaxis 2.5–4.7 cases per million doses, myocarditis 3.5 cases per million doses—and were similarly rare for all other vaccines. Prices for the different vaccines varied from $2.15 to $29.75 per dose.
Implications
All vaccines appear to be safe and effective tools to prevent severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and death against all variants of concern, but the quality of evidence greatly varies depending on the vaccines considered. Questions remain regarding a booster dose and waning immunity, the duration of immunity, and heterologous vaccination. The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risks, despite rare serious adverse effects.

AB  - The world is engulfed by one of the most widespread and significant public health crises in decades as COVID-19 has become among the leading causes of death internationally. The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus which causes COVID-19 has unified the scientific community in search of therapeutic and preventative solutions. The top priorities at the moment are twofold: first, to repurpose already-approved pharmacologic agents or develop novel therapies to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the ever-spreading virus. Secondly, the scientific and larger pharmaceutical community have been tasked with the development, testing, and production of a safe and effective vaccine as a longer-term solution to prevent further spread and recurrence throughout the populace. The purpose of this article is to review the most up-to-date published data regarding both the leading pharmacological therapies undergoing clinical trials and vaccine candidates in development to stem the threat of COVID-19.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's lives worldwide. Among various strategies being applied to addressing such a global crisis, public vaccination has been arguably the most appropriate approach to control a pandemic. However, vaccine supply chain and management have become a new challenge for governments. In this study, a solution for the vaccine supply chain is presented to address the hurdles in the public vaccination program according to the concerns of the government and the organizations involved. For this purpose, a robust bi-level optimization model is proposed. At the upper level, the risk of mortality due to the untimely supply of the vaccine and the risk of inequality in the distribution of the vaccine is considered. All costs related to the vaccine supply chain are considered at the lower level, including the vaccine supply, allocation of candidate centers for vaccine injection, cost of maintenance and injection, transportation cost, and penalty cost due to the vaccine shortage. In addition, the uncertainty of demand for vaccines is considered with multiple scenarios of different demand levels. Numerical experiments are conducted based on the vaccine supply chain in Kermanshah, Iran, and the results show that the proposed model significantly reduces the risk of mortality and inequality in the distribution of vaccines as well as the total cost, which leads to managerial insights for better coordination of the vaccination network during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Purpose
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries have scrambled to set up data collection and dissemination pipelines for various online datasets. This study aims to evaluate the reliability of the preliminary COVID-19 mortality data from Serbia, which has been included in major COVID-19 databases and utilized for research purposes worldwide.
Methods
Discrepancies between the preliminary mortality data and the final mortality data in Serbia were analyzed. The preliminary data were reported through an emergency-necessitated system, while the final data were generated by the regular vital statistics pipeline. We identified databases that include these data and conducted a literature review of articles that utilized them.
Results
The number of deaths due to COVID-19 in Serbia, as reported preliminarily, does not align with the final death toll, which is more than three times higher. Our literature review identified at least 86 studies that were impacted by these problematic data.
Conclusions
We strongly advise researchers to disregard the preliminary COVID-19 mortality data from Serbia due to the significant discrepancies with the final data. We recommend validating any preliminary data using excess mortality if all-cause mortality data are available.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people and posed an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems and economies worldwide since the outbreak of the COVID-19. A considerable number of nations have investigated COVID-19 and proposed a series of prevention and treatment strategies thus far. The pandemic prevention strategies implemented in China have suggested that the spread of COVID-19 can be effectively reduced by restricting large-scale gathering, developing community-scale nucleic acid testing, and conducting epidemiological investigations, whereas sporadic cases have always been identified in numerous places. Currently, there is still no decisive therapy for COVID-19 or related complications. The development of COVID-19 vaccines has raised the hope for mitigating this pandemic based on the intercross immunity induced by COVID-19. Thus far, several types of COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and released to into financial markets. From the perspective of vaccine use in globe, COVID-19 vaccines are beneficial to mitigate the pandemic, whereas the relative adverse events have been reported progressively. This is a review about the development, challenges and prospects of COVID-19 vaccines, and it can provide more insights into all aspects of the vaccines.

AB  - Estimating the total coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality burden of solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs), both directly through COVID-19 infection and indirectly through other impacts on the healthcare system and society, is critical for understanding the disease’s impact on the SOTR population. Using SRTR data, we modeled expected mortality risk per month pre-COVID (January 2015–February 2020) for kidney/liver/heart/lung SOTRs, and compared monthly COVID-era deaths (March 2020–March 2021) to expected rates, overall and among subgroups. Deaths above expected rates were designated “excess deaths.” Between March 2020 and March 2021, there were 3739/827/265/252 excess deaths among kidney/liver/heart/lung SOTRs, respectively, representing a 41.2%/27.4%/18.5%/15.0% increase above expected deaths. 93.0% of excess deaths occurred in patients age≥50. The observed:expected ratio was highest among Hispanic SOTRs (1.82) and lowest among White SOTRs (1.20); 56.0% of excess deaths occurred among Black or Hispanic SOTRs. 64.7% of excess deaths occurred among patients who had survived ≥5 years post-transplant. Excess deaths peaked in January 2021; geographic distribution of excess deaths broadly mirrored COVID-19 incidence. COVID-19 likely caused over 5000 excess deaths among SOTRs in the US in a 13-month period, representing 1 in 75 SOTRs and a substantial proportion of all deaths among SOTRs during this time. SOTRs will remain at elevated mortality risk until the COVID-19 pandemic can be controlled.

AB  - Summary
Background
To inform future preventive measures including repeated vaccinations, we have searched for a clinically useful immune correlate of protection against fatal COVID-19 among nursing homes residents.
Methods
We performed repeated capillary blood sampling with analysis of S-binding IgG in an open cohort of nursing home residents in Sweden. We analyzed immunological and registry data from 16 September 2021 to 31 August 2022 with follow-up of deaths to 30 September 2022. The study period included implementation of the 3rd and 4th mRNA monovalent vaccine doses and Omicron virus waves.
Findings
A total of 3012 nursing home residents with median age 86 were enrolled. The 3rd mRNA dose elicited a 99-fold relative increase of S-binding IgG in blood and corresponding increase of neutralizing antibodies. The 4th mRNA vaccine dose boosted levels 3.8-fold. Half-life of S-binding IgG was 72 days. A total 528 residents acquired their first SARS-CoV-2 infection after the 3rd or the 4th vaccine dose and the associated 30-day mortality was 9.1%. We found no indication that levels of vaccine-induced antibodies protected against infection with Omicron VOCs. In contrast, the risk of death was inversely correlated to levels of S-directed IgG below the 20th percentile. The death risk plateaued at population average above the lower 35th percentile of S-binding IgG.
Interpretation
In the absence of neutralizing antibodies that protect from infection, quantification of S-binding IgG post vaccination may be useful to identify the most vulnerable for fatal COVID-19 among the oldest and frailest. This information is of importance for future strategies to protect vulnerable populations against neutralization resistant variants of concern.

KW  - Value-based price
KW  - COVID-19 vaccine
AB  - Aim
The purpose of this study is to determine the value-based price of a COVID-19 vaccine from a societal perspective in Germany.
Methods
A decision model was constructed using, e.g., information on age-specific fatality rates, intensive care unit (ICU) costs and outcomes, and the full vaccination rate. Three strategies were analysed: vaccination (with 95 % and 50 % efficacy against death), a mitigation strategy, and no intervention. The base-case time horizon was 5 years. The value of a vaccine includes savings from avoiding COVID-19 mitigation measures and productivity loss, as well as health benefits from preventing COVID-19 related mortality. The value of an additional life year was borrowed from new, innovative oncological drugs, as cancer reflects a condition with a similar morbidity and mortality burden in the general population in the short term as COVID-19.
Results
A vaccine with a 95 % efficacy dominates the mitigation strategy strictly. The value-based price (€6,431) is thus determined by the comparison between vaccination and no intervention. The price is particularly sensitive to the full vaccination rate and the duration of vaccine protection. In contrast, the value of a vaccine with 50 % efficacy is more ambiguous.
Conclusion
This study yields a value-based price for a COVID-19 vaccine with 95 % efficacy, which is considerably greater than the purchasing price.

AB  - Background
Israel began a mass vaccination program with the rapid rollout of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 BNT162b2 vaccine for adults. At the same time, government stringency measures in terms of closing public life were decreased. Our objective was to estimate the total number of Covid-19 deaths avoided due to the massive vaccination campaign in the elderly Israeli population.
Methods
We examined the effect of vaccination on mortality when at least 90% of the population over age 70 were vaccinated for less than seven months. Projected deaths as expected from vaccine efficacy and actual mortality data were compared for the study population to account for potential confounding effects of government stringency. The average Oxford Stringency Index was calculated in the study period and the preceding period of the pandemic. Potential confounding effects of an age shift in the distribution of deaths were examined by analyzing the distributions before and after the study period.
Results
Confirmed deaths from COVID-19 in the population over 70 after mass vaccination were recorded as 370, versus 5,120 estimated without vaccinations.
Conclusions
Vaccines against COVID-19 saved more lives than expected by simply applying individual vaccine efficacy to the vaccinated population in Israel, despite a loosening of government stringency. Our findings support the worldwide efforts of governments to improve vaccination rates, especially in the elderly population.

AB  - While the swift development and production of a COVID-19 vaccine has been a remarkable success, it is equally crucial to ensure that the vaccine is allocated and distributed in a timely and efficient manner. Prior research on pandemic supply chain has not fully incorporated the underlying factors and constraints in designing a vaccine allocation model. This study proposes an innovative vaccine allocation model to contain the spread of infectious diseases incorporating key contributing factors to the risk of uninoculated people including susceptibility rate and exposure risk. Analyses of the data collected from the state of Victoria in Australia show that a vaccine allocation model can deliver a superior performance in minimizing the risk of unvaccinated people when a multi-period approach is employed and augmenting operational mechanisms including transshipment between medical centers, capacity sharing, and mobile units being integrated into the vaccine allocation model.

AB  - Summary
Background
Mortality statistics are fundamental to public health decision making. Mortality varies by time and location, and its measurement is affected by well known biases that have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aims to estimate excess mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic in 191 countries and territories, and 252 subnational units for selected countries, from Jan 1, 2020, to Dec 31, 2021.
Methods
All-cause mortality reports were collected for 74 countries and territories and 266 subnational locations (including 31 locations in low-income and middle-income countries) that had reported either weekly or monthly deaths from all causes during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, and for up to 11 year previously. In addition, we obtained excess mortality data for 12 states in India. Excess mortality over time was calculated as observed mortality, after excluding data from periods affected by late registration and anomalies such as heat waves, minus expected mortality. Six models were used to estimate expected mortality; final estimates of expected mortality were based on an ensemble of these models. Ensemble weights were based on root mean squared errors derived from an out-of-sample predictive validity test. As mortality records are incomplete worldwide, we built a statistical model that predicted the excess mortality rate for locations and periods where all-cause mortality data were not available. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression as a variable selection mechanism and selected 15 covariates, including both covariates pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as seroprevalence, and to background population health metrics, such as the Healthcare Access and Quality Index, with direction of effects on excess mortality concordant with a meta-analysis by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With the selected best model, we ran a prediction process using 100 draws for each covariate and 100 draws of estimated coefficients and residuals, estimated from the regressions run at the draw level using draw-level input data on both excess mortality and covariates. Mean values and 95% uncertainty intervals were then generated at national, regional, and global levels. Out-of-sample predictive validity testing was done on the basis of our final model specification.
Findings
Although reported COVID-19 deaths between Jan 1, 2020, and Dec 31, 2021, totalled 5·94 million worldwide, we estimate that 18·2 million (95% uncertainty interval 17·1–19·6) people died worldwide because of the COVID-19 pandemic (as measured by excess mortality) over that period. The global all-age rate of excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic was 120·3 deaths (113·1–129·3) per 100 000 of the population, and excess mortality rate exceeded 300 deaths per 100 000 of the population in 21 countries. The number of excess deaths due to COVID-19 was largest in the regions of south Asia, north Africa and the Middle East, and eastern Europe. At the country level, the highest numbers of cumulative excess deaths due to COVID-19 were estimated in India (4·07 million [3·71–4·36]), the USA (1·13 million [1·08–1·18]), Russia (1·07 million [1·06–1·08]), Mexico (798 000 [741 000–867 000]), Brazil (792 000 [730 000–847 000]), Indonesia (736 000 [594 000–955 000]), and Pakistan (664 000 [498 000–847 000]). Among these countries, the excess mortality rate was highest in Russia (374·6 deaths [369·7–378·4] per 100 000) and Mexico (325·1 [301·6–353·3] per 100 000), and was similar in Brazil (186·9 [172·2–199·8] per 100 000) and the USA (179·3 [170·7–187·5] per 100 000).
Interpretation
The full impact of the pandemic has been much greater than what is indicated by reported deaths due to COVID-19 alone. Strengthening death registration systems around the world, long understood to be crucial to global public health strategy, is necessary for improved monitoring of this pandemic and future pandemics. In addition, further research is warranted to help distinguish the proportion of excess mortality that was directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and the changes in causes of death as an indirect consequence of the pandemic.

AB  - Crisis-induced vaccine supply chain management has recently drawn attention to the importance of immediate responses to a crisis (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic). This study develops a queuing model for a crisis-induced vaccine supply chain to ensure efficient coordination and distribution of different COVID-19 vaccine types to people with various levels of vulnerability. We define a utility function for queues to study the changes in arrival rates related to the inventory level of vaccines, the efficiency of vaccines, and a risk aversion coefficient for vaccinees. A multi-period queuing model considering congestion in the vaccination process is proposed to minimise two contradictory objectives: (i) the expected average wait time of vaccinees and (ii) the total investment in the holding and ordering of vaccines. To develop the bi-objective non-linear programming model, the goal attainment algorithm and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) are employed for small- to large-scale problems. Several solution repairs are also implemented in the classic NSGA-II algorithm to improve its efficiency. Four standard performance metrics are used to investigate the algorithm. The non-parametric Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests are applied on several numerical examples to ensure the privilege of the improved algorithm. The NSGA-II algorithm surveys an authentic case study in Australia, and several scenarios are created to provide insights for an efficient vaccination program.

AB  - Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly, giving rise to a pandemic, causing significant morbidity and mortality. In this context, many vaccines have emerged to try to deal with this disease.
Objective
To review the reported cases of neurological manifestations after the application of COVID-19 vaccines, describing clinical, analytical and neuroimaging findings and health outcomes.
Methods
We carried out a review through bibliographic searches in PubMed.
Results
We found 86 articles, including 13 809 patients with a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations temporally associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Most occurred in women (63.89%), with a median age of 50 years. The most frequently reported adverse events were Bell’s palsy 4936/13 809 (35.7%), headache (4067/13 809), cerebrovascular events 2412/13 809 (17.47%), Guillain-Barré syndrome 868/13 809 (6.28%), central nervous system demyelination 258/13 809 (1.86%) and functional neurological disorder 398/13 809 (2.88%). Most of the published cases occurred in temporal association with the Pfizer vaccine (BNT162b2), followed by the AstraZeneca vaccine (ChAdOX1-S).
Conclusions
It is not possible to establish a causal relationship between these adverse events and COVID-19 vaccines with the currently existing data, nor to calculate the frequency of appearance of these disorders. However, it is necessary for health professionals to be familiar with these events, facilitating their early diagnosis and treatment. Large controlled epidemiological studies are necessary to establish a possible causal relationship between vaccination against COVID-19 and neurological adverse events.
Resumen
Introducción
La enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) se ha propagado de forma rápida, dando lugar a una situación de pandemia, con importante morbilidad y mortalidad. En este contexto, han surgido un amplio número de vacunas para tratar de hacer frente a la enfermedad.
Objetivo
Revisar los casos reportados de manifestaciones neurológicas tras la aplicación de las vacunas contra COVID-19, describiendo los hallazgos clínicos, analíticos, de neuroimagen y los resultados de salud.
Métodos
Revisión bibliográfica estructurada en la base de datos PubMed.
Resultados
Encontramos 86 artículos, que incluyeron 13.809 pacientes con un amplio espectro de manifestaciones neurológicas asociadas temporalmente con la vacunación contra COVID-19. La mayoría ocurrieron en mujeres (63,89%), con una mediana de edad de 50 años. Los eventos adversos publicados con más frecuencia fueron parálisis facial de Bell 4936/13809 (35,7%), cefalea (4067/13809), eventos vasculares cerebrales 2412/13809 (17,47%), síndrome de Guillain-Barré 868/13809 (6,28%), desmielinización del sistema nervioso central 258/13809 (1,86%) y trastorno neurológico funcional 398/13809 (2,88%). La mayoría de casos publicados se produjeron en asociación temporal con la vacuna Pfizer (BNT162b2), seguida de la vacuna de AstraZeneca (ChAdOX1 nCoV-19).
Conclusiones
Con los datos existentes actualmente no es posible establecer una relación de causalidad entre estos eventos adversos y las vacunas contra COVID-19, ni calcular la frecuencia de aparición de estos trastornos. Sin embargo, es necesario que los profesionales de la salud estén familiarizados con estos eventos, facilitando su diagnóstico y tratamiento tempranos. Son necesarios grandes estudios epidemiológicos controlados para establecer una posible relación causal entre la vacunación contra COVID-19 y los eventos adversos neurológicos.

AB  - Quantifying and analyzing excess mortality in crises such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is crucial for policymakers. Traditional measures fail to take into account differences in the level, long-term secular trends, and seasonal patterns in all-cause mortality across countries and regions. This paper develops and empirically investigates the forecasting performance of a novel, flexible and dynamic ensemble learning with a model selection strategy (DELMS) for the seasonal time series forecasting of monthly respiratory disease death data across a pool of 61 heterogeneous countries. The strategy is based on a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) of heterogeneous time series methods involving both the selection of the subset of best forecasters (model confidence set), the identification of the best holdout period for each contributed model, and the determination of optimal weights using out-of-sample predictive accuracy. A model selection strategy is also developed to remove the outlier models and to combine the models with reasonable accuracy in the ensemble. The empirical outcomes of this large set of experiments show that the accuracy of the BMA approach is significantly improved with DELMS when selecting a flexible and dynamic holdout period and removing the outlier models. Additionally, the forecasts of respiratory disease deaths for each country are highly accurate and exhibit a high correlation (94%) with COVID-19 deaths in 2020.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Objectives
The global reported cumulative case–fatality ratios (rCFRs) and excess mortality rates of the 20 countries with the highest coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination rates, the rest of the world and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) were compared before and after the commencement of vaccination programmes.
Methods
A time series model was used to understand the trend of rCFR over time, and a generalized linear mixed model was used to understand the effect of vaccination on rCFR.
Results
By 31 December 2022, an average of 260.3 doses of COVID-19 vaccine per 100 population had been administered in the top 20 vaccinated countries, compared with 152.1 doses in the rest of the world and 51.2 doses in SSA. The mean rCFR of COVID-19 had decreased by 69.0% in the top 20 vaccinated countries, 26.5% in the rest of the world and 7.6% in SSA. Excess mortality had decreased by 48.7% in the top 20 vaccinated countries, compared with 62.5% in the rest of the world and 60.7% in SSA. In a generalized linear mixed model, the reported number of vaccine doses administered (/100 population) (odds ratio 0.64) was associated with a steeper reduction in COVID-19 rCFR.
Conclusions
Vaccine equity and faster roll-out across the world is critically important in reducing COVID-19 transmission and CFR.

AB  - Objective
To investigate the association between Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and COVID-19 vaccination.
Background
On July 13, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a new warning that Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine could increase the risk of developing GBS.
Methods
The reporting rate of adult GBS after COVID-19 vaccination, ascertained with Brighton criteria, was compared with the reporting rate after other vaccinations during the same time period, and also compared with the reporting rate during control periods. Statistical methods such as proportion tests, and Pearson’s chi-squared test were utilized to identify significant relationships. Self-controlled and case centered analyses were conducted. A machine learning model was utilized to identify the factors associated with a worse outcome defined as emergency room (ER) or doctor visits, hospitalizations, and deaths.
Results
The reporting rate of GBS after COVID-19 vaccination was significantly higher than after influenza and other vaccinations (49.7, 0.19, 0.16 per 10 million, p < 0.0001). However, the reporting rate was within the incidence range of GBS in the general population. Using self-controlled and case centered analyses, there was a significant difference in the reporting rate of GBS after COVID-19 vaccination between the risk period and control period (p < 0.0001). There was an estimated 0.7–1.7 per million excess reports of GBS within 6 weeks of COVID-19 vaccination. Machine learning model demonstrated that female gender and age between 18 and 44 are associated with worse outcome. No association was found between the onset interval of GBS and its prognosis.
Conclusions
Although the reporting rate of GBS after COVID-19 vaccination was not statistically different than that of the general population, the increased reporting of GBS within the first 6 weeks after COVID-19 vaccination, more so than with other vaccinations, suggests that some cases of GBS are temporally associated with COVID-19 vaccination. However, there is a reduction in the reporting rate of GBS after other vaccines, compared to reporting rates pre-COVID-19, highlighting limitations inherent in any passive surveillance system. These findings warrant continuous analysis of GBS after COVID-19 vaccination. Further improvement of the machine learning model is needed for clinical use.

AB  - Summary
Background
National immunisation programmes globally are at risk of suspension due to the severe health system constraints and physical distancing measures in place to mitigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to compare the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa with the risk of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection through visiting routine vaccination service delivery points.
Methods
We considered a high-impact scenario and a low-impact scenario to approximate the child deaths that could be caused by immunisation coverage reductions during COVID-19 outbreaks. In the high-impact scenario, we used previously reported country-specific child mortality impact estimates of childhood immunisation for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, rotavirus, measles, meningitis A, rubella, and yellow fever to approximate the future deaths averted before 5 years of age by routine childhood vaccination during a 6-month COVID-19 risk period without catch-up campaigns. In the low-impact scenario, we approximated the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation on only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks during the COVID-19 risk period. We assumed that contact-reducing interventions flattened the outbreak curve during the COVID-19 risk period, that 60% of the population will have been infected by the end of that period, that children can be infected by either vaccinators or during transport, and that upon child infection the whole household will be infected. Country-specific household age structure estimates and age-dependent infection-fatality rates were applied to calculate the number of deaths attributable to the vaccination clinic visits. We present benefit–risk ratios for routine childhood immunisation, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
Findings
In the high-impact scenario, for every one excess COVID-19 death attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections acquired during routine vaccination clinic visits, 84 (95% UI 14–267) deaths in children could be prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa. The benefit–risk ratio for the vaccinated children is 85 000 (4900–546 000), for their siblings (<20 years) is 75 000 (4400–483 000), for their parents or adult carers (aged 20–60 years) is 769 (148–2700), and for older adults (>60 years) is 96 (14–307). In the low-impact scenario that approximates the health benefits to only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks, the benefit–risk ratio to the households of vaccinated children is 3 (0·5–10); if the risk to only the vaccinated children is considered, the benefit–risk ratio is 3000 (182–21 000).
Interpretation
The deaths prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa outweigh the excess risk of COVID-19 deaths associated with vaccination clinic visits, especially for the vaccinated children. Routine childhood immunisation should be sustained in Africa as much as possible, while considering other factors such as logistical constraints, staff shortages, and reallocation of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Novavax, a global vaccine company, began evaluating NVX-CoV2373 in human studies in May 2020 and the pivotal placebo-controlled phase 3 studies started in November 2020; five clinical studies provided adult and adolescent clinical data for over 31,000 participants who were administered NVX-CoV2373. This extensive data has demonstrated a well-tolerated response to NVX-CoV2373 and high vaccine efficacy against mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 using a two-dose series (Dunkle et al., 2022) [1], (Heath et al., 2021) [2], (Keech et al., 2020) [3], (Mallory et al., 2022) [4]. The most common adverse events seen after administration with NVX-CoV2373 were injection site tenderness, injection site pain, fatigue, myalgia, headache, malaise, arthralgia, nausea, or vomiting. In addition, immunogenicity against variants of interest (VOI) and variants of concern (VOC) was established with high titers of ACE2 receptor-inhibiting and neutralizing antibodies in these studies (EMA, 2022) [5], (FDA, 2023) [6]. Further studies on correlates of protection determined that titers of anti-Spike IgG and neutralizing antibodies correlated with efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 established in clinical trials (p < 0.001 for recombinant protein vaccine and p = 0.005 for mRNA vaccines for IgG levels) (Fong et al., 2022) [7]. Administration of a booster dose of the recombinant protein vaccine approximately 6 months following the primary two-dose series resulted in substantial increases in humoral antibodies against both the prototype strain and all evaluated variants, similar to or higher than the antibody levels observed in phase 3 studies that were associated with high vaccine efficacy (Dunkle et al., 2022) [1], (Mallory et al., 2022) [4]. These findings, together with the well tolerated safety profile, support use of the recombinant protein vaccine as primary series and booster regimens.

AB  - Objectives
This nationwide, multicentric, retrospective analysis of 1,126,946 COVID-19 cases (March 2020 to June 2022) aims to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on mortality in patients with a sole solid malignancy.
Methods
Using data from the national digital medical record repository, outcomes were compared among fully vaccinated and non-vaccinated cohorts, factoring in gender, virus type, age, vaccination status, vaccine type, and cancer type. Logistic regression calculated odds ratios and their significance.
Results
Among 6,050 patients with both cancer and comorbidities, 1,797 had only solid malignancy. Vaccinated individuals in this group had reduced mortality rates, especially those >63 years [OR 0.169 (95%CI 0.090 to 0.317); P < 0.001]. Lower deaths were observed in non-ICU [OR 0.193 (95% CI 0.097 to 0.382); P < 0.001] and ICU cases [OR 0.224 (95% CI 0.077 to 0.646); P = 0.003], with both vaccine types. No statistically significant benefits were observed against delta and omicron variants. Intrathoracic malignancies [OR 0.376 (95%CI 0.146 to 0.971); P = 0.043] and palliative treatment [OR 0.384 (95%CI 0.192 to 0.766); P = 0.006] showed vaccination benefits. Logistic regression revealed a higher fatal risk in non-vaccinated males >63. Propensity score matching supported these outcomes.
Conclusion
Patients with sole solid malignancies face elevated COVID-19 mortality risk, particularly without active cytostatic therapy, with advanced disease on palliative treatment, or intrathoracic malignancies.

AB  - Objectives
The COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by successive waves that each developed differently over time and through space. We aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the evolution of COVID-19 mortality during 2020 and 2021 in a selection of countries.
Methods
We focus on five European countries and the United States. Using standardized and age-specific mortality rates, we address variations in COVID-19 mortality within and between countries, and demographic characteristics and seasonality patterns.
Results
Our results highlight periods of acceleration and deceleration in the pace of COVID-19 mortality, with substantial differences across countries. Periods of stabilization were identified during summer (especially in 2020) among the European countries analyzed but not in the United States. The latter stands out as the study population with the highest COVID-19 mortality at young ages. In general, COVID-19 mortality is highest at old ages, particularly during winter. Compared with women, men have higher COVID-19 mortality rates at most ages and in most seasons.
Conclusion
There is seasonality in COVID-19 mortality for both sexes at all ages, characterized by higher rates during winter. In 2021, the highest COVID-19 mortality rates continued to be observed at ages 75+, despite vaccinations having targeted those ages specifically.

AB  - Background
Women who received a COVID-19 vaccination may display subclinical unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy on screening mammography, which can appear suspicious for malignancy, leading to additional diagnostic evaluation.
Purpose
To evaluate the prevalence of subclinical unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy (sLAD) on screening mammogram in women who received either the first or second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech (Pfizer) or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines compared to women who have not.
Materials and Methods
In this IRB-approved, HIPAA complaint study from 12/14/2020 to 4/14/2021, 1027 patients presented for screening mammography and met study inclusion criteria. Patients with history of baseline lymphadenopathy or prior cancer diagnosis were excluded.
Results
: Of the 1027 women, 43 were recalled for unilateral sLAD. 34 women received a COVID-19 vaccination ipsilateral to the sLAD (Pfizer n=19, 44.2%; Moderna n=15, 34.9%), 9 did not (20.9%). Incidence of unilateral axillary sLAD was significantly higher (p-value<0.01) in those who received a COVID-19 vaccination within approximately 7 weeks preceding screening mammogram. 13.2% of patients who received the Pfizer vaccine and 9.5% of patients who received the Moderna vaccine developed sLAD. Moderna's vaccine elicited a more robust reaction in the elderly (Moderna 63.7 years vs. Pfizer 59.7 years). For both vaccines, sLAD resolved on average 46.5 days after the last COVID-19 vaccine (p=0.44).
Conclusion
Women who have received either mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may benefit from scheduling their screening mammogram before vaccination or consider delaying screening mammography 8 weeks. While Pfizer may have an overall more robust immune response, Moderna may elicit a stronger immune response in elderly women.
Summary
Women who received a COVID-19 vaccination before screening mammography were significantly more likely to present with subclinical axillary lymphadenopathy than women who did not receive the vaccine.
Key Results
13.2% of women who received a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine exhibited subclinical axillary lymphadenopathy compared to 9.5% of those who received the Moderna vaccine. Only 1.2 % of those who did not receive a vaccine presented with subclinical unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. The average time of resolution of the lymphadenopathy on diagnostic mammogram was 46.5 days overall, with Pfizer-BioNTech taking 50.7 days and Moderna 41.5 days.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 vaccine uptake by healthcare workers (HCWs) is critical to protect HCWs, the patients they care for, and the healthcare infrastructure. Our study aims to examine the actual COVID-19 vaccination rate among HCWs and identify risk factors associated with vaccine nonacceptance.
Study Design and Methods
A retrospective analysis of COVID-19 vaccinations for HCWs at a large multi-site US academic medical center from 12/18/2020 through 05/04/2021. Comparisons between groups were performed using unpaired student t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. A logistic regression analysis was used to assess the associations between vaccine uptake and risk factor(s).
Results
Of the 65,270 HCWs included in our analysis, the overall vaccination rate was 78.6%. Male gender, older age, White and Asian race, and direct patient care were associated with higher vaccination rates (P <.0001). Significant differences were observed between different job categories. Physicians and advanced practice staff, and healthcare professionals were more likely to be vaccinated than nurses and support staff.
Conclusions
Our data demonstrated higher initial vaccination rates among HCWs than the general population national average during the study period. We observed significant disparities among different high-risk HCWs groups, especially among different job categories, black HCWs and younger HCWs despite their high risk of contracting the infection. Interventions to address lower vaccination rate and vaccine hesitancy should be built with these disparities and differences in mind to create more targeted interventions.

AB  - Objectives
Mass COVID-19 vaccination commenced in December 2020 in Scotland. Monitoring vaccine safety relies on accurate background incidence rates (IRs) for health outcomes potentially associated with vaccination. This study aimed to quantify IRs in Scotland of adverse events of special interest (AESI) potentially associated with COVID-19 vaccination.
Study design and methods
IRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 36 AESI were calculated retrospectively for the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period (01 January 2015–31 December 2019) and the COVID-19 pandemic period (01 April 2020–30 November 2020), with age-sex stratification, and separately by calendar month and year. Incident cases were determined using International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10)–coded hospitalisations.
Results
Prepandemic population-wide IRs ranged from 0.4 (0.3–0.5 CIs) cases per 100,000 person-years (PYRS) for neuromyelitis optica to 478.4 (475.8–481.0 CIs) cases per 100,000 PYRS for acute renal failure. Pandemic population-wide IRs ranged from 0.3 (0.2–0.5 CIs) cases per 100,000 PYRS for Kawasaki disease to 483.4 (473.2–493.7 CIs) cases per 100,000 PYRS for acute coronary syndrome. All AESI IRs varied by age and sex. Ten AESI (acute coronary syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, heart failure, multiple sclerosis, polyneuropathies and peripheral neuropathies, respiratory failure, rheumatoid arthritis and polyarthritis, seizures and vasculitis) had lower pandemic than prepandemic period IRs overall. Only deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism had a higher pandemic IR.
Conclusion
Lower pandemic IRs likely resulted from reduced health-seeking behaviours and healthcare provision. Higher IRs may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections. AESI IRs will facilitate future vaccine safety studies in Scotland.

AB  - The Brighton Collaboration Benefit-Risk Assessment of VAccines by TechnolOgy (BRAVATO) Working Group has prepared standardized templates to describe the key considerations for the benefit-risk assessment of several vaccine platform technologies, including nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) vaccines. This paper uses the BRAVATO template to review the features of a vaccine employing a proprietary mRNA vaccine platform to develop Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273); a highly effective vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In response to the pandemic the first in human studies began in March 2020 and the pivotal, placebo-controlled phase 3 efficacy study in over 30,000 adults began in July 2020. Based on demonstration of efficacy and safety at the time of interim analysis in November 2020 and at the time of trial unblinding in March 2021, the mRNA-1273 received Emergency Use Authorization in December 2020 and full FDA approval in January 2022.

The actual risk of thrombotic events after Covid-19 vaccination is unknown.
Objective
To evaluate the risk of thrombotic events after Covid-19 vaccination.
Design
Retrospective cohort study which included consecutive adult patients vaccinated with the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine between January 1 and May 30, 2021, and a historic control group, defined as consecutive patients vaccinated with influenza vaccine between March 1 and July 30, 2019.
Setting
Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, a tertiary hospital in Argentina.
Participants
Non-Hospitalized Adults vaccinated with the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.
Exposure
Vaccination with Covid-19 vaccines available during the study period: Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca/Oxford or Covishield), BBIBP-CorV (Beijing Institute of Biological Products) (Sinopharm). Active comparator group exposure was Influenza vaccine.
Main outcome
Primary endpoint was cumulative incidence of any symptomatic thrombotic event at 30 days, defined as the occurrence of at least one of the following: symptomatic acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT); symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE); acute ischemic stroke (AIS); acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or arterial thrombosis.
Results
From a total of 29,985 adult patients who received at least a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine during study period and 24,777 who received Influenza vaccine in 2019, we excluded those who were vaccinated during hospitalization. We finally included 29,918 and 24,753 patients respectively. Median age was 73 years old (IQR 75–81) and 67% were females in both groups. Thirty six subjects in the Covid-19 vaccination group (36/29,918) and 15 patients in the Influenza vaccination group (15/24,753) presented at least one thrombotic event. The cumulative incidence of any thrombotic event at 30 days was 12 per 10,000 (95%CI 9–17) for Covid-19 group and 6 per 10,000 (95%CI 4–10) for Influenza group (p-value=0.022).
Conclusions and relevance
This study shows a significant increase in thrombotic events in subjects vaccinated with Covid-19 vaccines in comparison to a control group. The clinical implication of these findings should be interpreted with caution, in light of the high effectiveness of vaccination and the inherent risk of thrombosis from Covid-19 infection itself.

AB  - The global SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic presents a pressing health challenge for all countries, including Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ). As of early 2022, NZ public health measures have reduced impacts of the pandemic, but ongoing efforts to limit illness and fatalities will be significantly aided by widescale uptake of available vaccines including COVID-19 booster doses. Decades of research have established a broad range of demographic, social, cognitive, and behavioural factors which influence peoples’ uptake of vaccinations, including a large amount of research in the last two years focused on COVID-19 vaccination in particular. In this study, we surveyed people in New Zealand (N = 660) in May and June of 2021, at which point the vaccine had been made available to high-risk groups. We explored individual versus collective motivations, finding that people who were hesitant about COVID-19 vaccination scored lower on independent self-construals (how people define themselves) but higher on community identity, weaker but still positive perceived social norms, lower general risk of COVID-19 to New Zealanders and higher vaccine risk for both themselves and others, and lower response-efficacy both for personal and collective benefits. Overall, the findings suggest some benefit of collective over individual appeals, but that generally messaging to encourage vaccination should focus on conveying social norms, risk from COVID-19 broadly, and vaccine safety and efficacy.

AB  - Latino people in the US are experiencing higher excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic than any other racial/ethnic group, but it is unclear which sociodemographic subgroups within this diverse population are most affected. Such information is necessary to target policies that prevent further excess mortality and reduce inequities. Using death certificate data for January 1, 2016 through February 29, 2020 and time-series models, we estimated the expected weekly deaths among Latino people in California from March 1 through October 3, 2020. We quantified excess mortality as observed minus expected deaths and risk ratios (RR) as the ratio of observed to expected deaths. We considered subgroups categorized by age, sex, nativity, country of birth, educational attainment, occupation, and combinations of these factors. Our results indicate that during the first seven months of the pandemic, Latino deaths in California exceeded expected deaths by 10,316, a 31% increase. Excess death rates were greatest for individuals born in Mexico (RR 1.44; 95% PI, 1.41, 1.48) or a Central American country (RR 1.49; 95% PI, 1.37, 1.64), with less than a high school degree (RR 1.41; 95% PI, 1.35, 1.46), or in food-and-agriculture (RR 1.60; 95% PI, 1.48, 1.74) or manufacturing occupations (RR 1.59; 95% PI, 1.50, 1.69). Immigrant disadvantages in excess death were magnified among working-age Latinos in essential occupations. In sum, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted mortality among Latino immigrants, especially those in unprotected essential jobs. Interventions to reduce these inequities should include targeted vaccination, workplace safety enforcement, and expanded access to medical care and economic support.

AB  - Governments can underreport Covid-19 mortality to make their performance appear more successful than it is. Autocracies are more likely to ‘fudge’ these data since many autocratic regimes restrict media freedom and thus can prevent domestic media from reporting evidence of undercounting deaths. Autocracies also enjoy greater leverage over reporting health authorities to either fudge data or adopt restrictive definitions of what constitutes Covid-19 mortality. Controlling for other factors that explain official Covid-19 mortality, excess mortality and the difference between the two, our results suggest that any apparent ‘autocratic advantage’ in fighting the pandemic is likely to only exist in official Covid-19 mortality. Analyzing the gap between excess mortality and official Covid-19 mortality we find that autocracies on average have a larger gap between official Covid-19 mortality data and excess mortality data, which points towards ‘autocratic data fudging’ of their official Covid-19 mortality statistics.

AB  - Background
Norway and Sweden picked two different ways to mitigate the dissemination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Norway introduced the strictest lockdown in Europe with strict border controls and intense virus tracking of all local outbreaks while Sweden did not. That resulted in 477 COVID-19 deaths (Norway) and 9737 (Sweden) in 2020, respectively.
Methods
Weekly number of COVID-19 related deaths and total deaths for 2020-22 were collected as well as weekly number of deaths for 2015-19 which were used as controls when calculating excess mortality. During the first 12-18 months with high rate of virus transmission in the society, excess mortality rates were used as substitute for COVID-19 deaths. When excess mortality rates later turned negative because of mortality displacement, COVID-19 deaths adjusted for bias due to overreporting were used.
Results
There were 17521 COVID-19 deaths in Sweden and 4272 in Norway in the study period. The rate ratio (RR) of COVID-19 related deaths in Sweden vs. Norway to the end of week 43, 2022, was 2.11 (95% CI 2.05-2.19). RR of COVID-19 related deaths vs. excess number of deaths were 2.5 (Sweden) and 1.3 (Norway), respectively. RR of COVID-19 deaths in Sweden vs. Norway after adjusting for mortality displacement and lockdown, was 1.35 (95% CI 1.31-1.39), corresponding to saving 2025 life in Norway. If including all deaths in 2022, RR=1.28 (95% CI 1.24-1.31).
Conclusions
Both COVID-19 related mortality and excess mortality rates are biased estimates. When adjusting for bias, mortality differences declined over time to about 30% higher mortality in Sweden after 30 months with pandemics and at the cost of 12 million € per prevented death in Norway.

AB  - We develop a simple model of vaccine prioritization for a potential pandemic. We illustrate how the model applies to the case of Covid-19, using an early 2020 primitive estimate of occupation-based exposure risks and age-based infection fatality rates. Even based on primitive estimates the vaccine distribution strongly emphasizes age-based mortality risk rather than occupation-based exposure risk. Among others, our result suggests that 50-year-old food-processing workers and 60-year-old financial advisors should have been equally prioritized. We also find that the priorities minimally change when certain populations’ exposure risks are altered by targeted stay-at-home orders or call-up of essential workers.

AB  - Summary
Background
The infection–fatality ratio (IFR) is a metric that quantifies the likelihood of an individual dying once infected with a pathogen. Understanding the determinants of IFR variation for COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has direct implications for mitigation efforts with respect to clinical practice, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and the prioritisation of risk groups for targeted vaccine delivery. The IFR is also a crucial parameter in COVID-19 dynamic transmission models, providing a way to convert a population's mortality rate into an estimate of infections.
Methods
We estimated age-specific and all-age IFR by matching seroprevalence surveys to total COVID-19 mortality rates in a population. The term total COVID-19 mortality refers to an estimate of the total number of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19. After applying exclusion criteria to 5131 seroprevalence surveys, the IFR analyses were informed by 2073 all-age surveys and 718 age-specific surveys (3012 age-specific observations). When seroprevalence was reported by age group, we split total COVID-19 mortality into corresponding age groups using a Bayesian hierarchical model to characterise the non-linear age pattern of reported deaths for a given location. To remove the impact of vaccines on the estimated IFR age pattern, we excluded age-specific observations of seroprevalence and deaths that occurred after vaccines were introduced in a location. We estimated age-specific IFR with a non-linear meta-regression and used the resulting age pattern to standardise all-age IFR observations to the global age distribution. All IFR observations were adjusted for baseline and waning antibody-test sensitivity. We then modelled age-standardised IFR as a function of time, geography, and an ensemble of 100 of the top-performing covariate sets. The covariates included seven clinical predictors (eg, age-standardised obesity prevalence) and two measures of health system performance. Final estimates for 190 countries and territories, as well as subnational locations in 11 countries and territories, were obtained by predicting age-standardised IFR conditional on covariates and reversing the age standardisation.
Findings
We report IFR estimates for April 15, 2020, to January 1, 2021, the period before the introduction of vaccines and widespread evolution of variants. We found substantial heterogeneity in the IFR by age, location, and time. Age-specific IFR estimates form a J shape, with the lowest IFR occurring at age 7 years (0·0023%, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0·0015–0·0039) and increasing exponentially through ages 30 years (0·0573%, 0·0418–0·0870), 60 years (1·0035%, 0·7002–1·5727), and 90 years (20·3292%, 14·6888–28·9754). The countries with the highest IFR on July 15, 2020, were Portugal (2·085%, 0·946–4·395), Monaco (1·778%, 1·265–2·915), Japan (1·750%, 1·302–2·690), Spain (1·710%, 0·991–2·718), and Greece (1·637%, 1·155–2·678). All-age IFR varied by a factor of more than 30 among 190 countries and territories. After age standardisation, the countries with the highest IFR on July 15, 2020, were Peru (0·911%, 0·636–1·538), Portugal (0·850%, 0·386–1·793), Oman (0·762%, 0·381–1·399), Spain (0·751%, 0·435–1·193), and Mexico (0·717%, 0·426–1·404). Subnational locations with high IFRs also included hotspots in the UK and southern and eastern states of the USA. Sub-Saharan African countries and Asian countries generally had the lowest all-age and age-standardised IFRs. Population age structure accounted for 74% of logit-scale variation in IFRs estimated for 39 in-sample countries on July 15, 2020. A post-hoc analysis showed that high rates of transmission in the care home population might account for higher IFRs in some locations. Among all countries and territories, we found that the median IFR decreased from 0·466% (interquartile range 0·223–0·840) to 0·314% (0·143–0·551) between April 15, 2020, and Jan 1, 2021.
Interpretation
Estimating the IFR for global populations helps to identify relative vulnerabilities to COVID-19. Information about how IFR varies by age, time, and location informs clinical practice and non-pharmaceutical interventions like physical distancing measures, and underpins vaccine risk stratification. IFR and mortality risk form a J shape with respect to age, which previous research, such as that by Glynn and Moss in 2020, has identified to be a common pattern among infectious diseases. Understanding the experience of a population with COVID-19 mortality requires consideration for local factors; IFRs varied by a factor of more than 30 among 190 countries and territories in this analysis. In particular, the presence of elevated age-standardised IFRs in countries with well resourced health-care systems indicates that factors beyond health-care capacity are important. Potential extenuating circumstances include outbreaks among care home residents, variable burdens of severe cases, and the population prevalence of comorbid conditions that increase the severity of COVID-19 disease. During the pre-vaccine period, the estimated 33% decrease in median IFR over 8 months suggests that treatment for COVID-19 has improved over time. Estimating IFR for the pre-vaccine era provides an important baseline for describing the progression of COVID-19 mortality patterns.

AB  - Pandemic dynamics and health care responses are markedly different during the COVID-19 pandemic than in earlier outbreaks. Compared with established infectious disease such as influenza, we currently know relatively little about the origin, reservoir, cross-species transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Health care services, drug availability, laboratory testing, research capacity and global governance are more advanced than during 20th century pandemics, although COVID-19 has highlighted significant gaps. The risk of zoonotic transmission and an associated new pandemic is rising substantially. COVID-19 vaccine development has been done at unprecedented speed, with the usual sequential steps done in parallel. The pandemic has illustrated the feasibility of this approach and the benefits of a globally coordinated response and infrastructure. Some of the COVID-19 vaccines recently developed or currently in development might offer flexibility or sufficiently broad protection to swiftly respond to antigenic drift or emergence of new coronaviruses. Yet many challenges remain, including the large-scale production of sufficient quantity of vaccines, delivery of vaccines to all countries and ensuring vaccination of relevant age groups. This wide vaccine technology approach will be best employed in tandem with active surveillance for emerging variants or new pathogens using antigen mapping, metagenomics and next generation sequencing.

AB  - Introduction
This study evaluated outcomes and risk factors for COVID-19 in 91 Brazilian multiple myeloma (MM) patients between April 2020 and January 2022.
Results
Of the 91 MM patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 64% had comorbidities and 66% required hospitalization due to COVID-19, with 44% needing ventilatory support and 37% intensive care. Age (OR 2.02; 95%CI 1.02 – 7.7) and hypertension OR 4.5; 95%CI 1.3 – 15.5) were independently associated with hospitalization and certain MM therapies (corticosteroids and monoclonal drugs) were associated with ventilatory support (OR 4.3; 95%CI 1.3 – 14 and OR 5.7; 95%CI 1.8 – 18, respectively), while corticosteroids and immunomodulatory drugs were linked to ICU admission (OR 5.1; 95% CI 1.4 – 18 and OR 3.4; 95%CI 1.1 – 10, respectively). The overall mortality rate was 30%, with the highest rate observed in the ICU (73%). Additionally, the ECOG performance status was linked to increased mortality (OR 11.5; 95%CI 1.9 – 69). The MM treatment was delayed in 63% of patients who recovered from COVID-19.
Conclusions
The findings highlight the need for preventing COVID-19 and prioritizing vaccination among MM patients, as they have high rates of severe outcomes in the event of COVID-19. It is also essential to monitor the potential clinical impacts of COVID-19 on MM patients in the long-term. Given the limited resources available in treating MM patients in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic, outcomes might be worse in this population.

AB  - We evaluate quartile rankings of countries during the Covid-19 pandemic using both official (confirmed) and excess mortality data. By December 2021, the quartile rankings of three-fifths of the countries differ when ranked by excess vs. official mortality. Countries that are ‘doing substantially better’ in the excess mortality are characterized by higher urban population shares; higher GDP/Capita; and higher scores on institutional and policy variables. We perform two regressions in which the ratio of Cumulative Excess to Official Covid-19 mortalities (E/O ratio) is regressed on covariates. In a narrow study, controlling for GDP/Capita and vaccination rates, by December 2021 the E/O ratio was smaller in countries with higher vaccination rates. In a broad study, adding institutional and policy variables, the E/O ratio was smaller in countries with higher degree of voice and accountability. The arrival of vaccines in 2021 and voice and accountability had a discernible association on the E/O ratio.

AB  - The objective of this systematic review is to give a comprehensive interpretation of menstrual cycle changes after the COVID-19 vaccination. Additionally, it is imperative to assess reports of menstrual changes following vaccination to dispel concerns that COVID-19 vaccines hinder the likelihood of pregnancy in the long run. A literature review was conducted using digital databases to systematically identify the studies reporting any menstrual abnormalities after the COVID-19 vaccine. Detailed patient-level study characteristics including the type of study, sample size, administered vaccines, and menstrual abnormalities were abstracted. A total of 78 138 vaccinated females were included in this review from 14 studies. Of these, 39 759 (52.05%) had some form of a menstrual problem after vaccination. Due to the lack of published research articles, preprints were also included in this review. Menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and polymenorrhea were the most commonly observed problems and the overall study-level rate of menstrual abnormality ranged from 0.83% to 90.9%. Age, history of pregnancy, systemic side-effects of COVID-19, smoking, and second dose of COVID-19 vaccine were predictors of menstrual problems after vaccination.

Alteraciones menstruales tras la vacunación contra la COVID-19: revisión sistemática Resumen El objetivo de esta revisión sistemática es aportar una interpretación amplia sobre los cambios de los ciclos menstruales tras la vacunación contra la COVID-19. Además, es imperativo evaluar los informes sobre los cambios menstruales tras la vacunación, para disipar preocupaciones en cuanto a que las vacunas contra la COVID-19 dificultan la probabilidad de embarazo a largo plazo. Se realizó una revisión de la literatura utilizando bases de datos digitales para identificar sistemáticamente los estudios que reportan cualquier alteración menstrual tras la vacuna contra la COVID-19. Se resumieron las características detalladas del estudio al nivel del paciente, incluyendo tipo de estudio, tamaño de la muestra, vacunas administradas, y alteraciones menstruales. Se incluyó en la revisión a un total de 78 138 mujeres vacunadas, procedentes de 14 estudios. De ellas, 39 759 (52,05%) tuvieron algún tipo de problema menstrual tras la vacunación. Debido a la falta de artículos de investigación publicados, también se incluyeron preimpresos en esta revisión. Menorragia, metrorragia, y polimenorrea fueron los problemas más comúnmente observados, oscilando la tasa global de alteraciones menstruales a nivel de estudios entre el 0,83 y el 90,9%. La edad, los antecedentes de embarazos, los efectos secundarios sistémicos de la COVID-19, el tabaquismo y la segunda dosis de la vacuna contra la COVID-19 fueron factores predictivos de problemas menstruales tras la vacunación.

AB  - Objectives
This article describes the prevalence and epidemiological trends of COVID-19 mortality in the largest registry in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).
Study design
A prospective epidemiological cohort study using data from all healthcare facilities in KSA collected between March 23, 2020, and April 30, 2022. Data on the number of daily deaths directly related to COVID-19 were gathered, analyzed, and reported.
Method
Data analysis was carried out using national and regional crude case fatality rate and death per 100,000 population. Descriptive statistics using numbers and proportions were used to describe age, gender, nationality, and comorbidities. The mortality trend was plotted and compared with international figures. In addition, the most common comorbidities associated with mortality and the proportion of patients who received COVID-19 vaccine were reported.
Results
The total reported number of deaths between March 23, 2020, and April 30, 2022, was 9085. Crude case fatality rate was 1.21%, and death per 100,000 population was 25.38, which compared favorably to figures reported by several developed countries. The highest percentages of deaths were among individuals aged between 60 and 69 years, males (71%), and individuals with diabetes (60%). Only 2.8% of mortalities occur in patients who received COVID-19 vaccine. Diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure had the highest attributable risk of mortality among patients who died due to COVID-19.
Conclusion
Case fatality rate and death per 100,000 population in KSA are among the lowest in the world due to multiple factors. Several comorbidities have been identified, namely, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and cardiac arrhythmias.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. has been largely monitored using death certificates containing reference to COVID-19. However, prior analyses reveal that a significant percentage of excess deaths associated with the pandemic were not directly assigned to COVID-19. In this study, we estimated a generalized linear model of expected mortality based on historical trends in deaths by county of residence between 2011 and 2019. We used the results of the model to generate estimates of excess mortality and excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 in 2020 for 1470 county sets in the U.S. representing 3138 counties. Across the country, we estimated that 438,386 excess deaths occurred in 2020, among which 87.5% were assigned to COVID-19. Some regions (Mideast, Great Lakes, New England, and Far West) reported the most excess deaths in large central metros, whereas other regions (Southwest, Southeast, Plains, and Rocky Mountains) reported the highest excess mortality in nonmetro areas. The proportion assigned to COVID-19 was lowest in large central metro areas (79.3%). Regionally, the proportion of excess deaths assigned to COVID-19 was lowest in the Southeast (81.6%), Southwest (82.6%), Far West (83.7%), and Rocky Mountains (86.7%). Across the regions, the number of excess deaths exceeded the number of directly assigned COVID-19 deaths in most counties. The exception to this pattern occurred in New England, which reported more directly assigned COVID-19 deaths than excess deaths in metro and nonmetro areas. Many county sets had substantial numbers of excess deaths that were not accounted for in direct COVID-19 death counts. Estimates of excess mortality at the local level can inform the allocation of resources to areas most impacted by the pandemic and contribute to positive behavior feedback loops, such as increases in mask-wearing and vaccine uptake.

AB  - Background
The risks of severe outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) are elevated in unvaccinated individuals. It remains crucial to understand patterns of COVID-19 vaccination, particularly in younger and remote populations where coverage often lags. This study examined disparities in COVID-19 vaccine coverage in farm children and adolescents.
Methods
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted in patients of the Marshfield Clinic Health System (MCHS) in Wisconsin. The sample included children/adolescents age 5–17 years who were eligible for COVID-19 vaccine initiation for ≥ 90 days (as of September 30, 2022), stratified by those who lived vs did not live on a farm. Outcomes included COVID-19 vaccine initiation, series completion, and booster receipt. Multivariable regression was used to examine associations between COVID-19 vaccination and farm, as well as rural and non-rural, residence.
Results
There were 47,104 individuals (5% farm residents) in the sample. Overall, 33% of participants initiated and 31% completed the COVID-19 vaccine series. After adjustment, farm residence was associated with significantly lower odds of COVID-19 vaccine initiation (aOR [95% CI] = 0.68 [0.61, 0.75], p < 0.001), series completion (aOR = 0.67 [0.60, 0.75], p < 0.001), and booster receipt (aOR = 0.73 [0.61, 0.88], p = 0.001). Secondary analyses found COVID-19 vaccine coverage was lowest in young children who lived on dairy farms.
Conclusions
COVID-19 vaccine coverage is low in north-central Wisconsin children and adolescents. Those who live on farms have significantly lower likelihood of COVID-19 vaccine initiation, series completion, and booster receipt compared to non-farm counterparts. Farm families are an underserved group and require more effective public health interventions designed to prevent COVID-19.

AB  - This research develops a humanitarian cold supply chain model with equity consideration for COVID-19 vaccine distribution during a pandemic, considering deprivation cost and an important social concept named equity. The proposed comprehensive plan minimizes all incurred costs, including transportation costs, shortage costs, deprivation costs, and holding costs, while aiming at eliminating infection and mortality rates. The proposed three-echelon supply chain model includes suppliers, distributors, and affected regions (ARs), as destinations. We apply the proposed model to the actual vaccine distribution data during the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is developed to minimize the costs and satisfy the demand goals in the vaccine distribution plan. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates how total and deprivation costs affect each other, helping the managers establish a trade-off between them. The results show that appropriate supply chain planning can minimize logistics and social costs. The proposed model can help policymakers, and decision-makers better understand the importance of equity and implement a fair distribution of vaccines, considering the deprivation cost as a social cost.

AB  - Vaccination is a critical preventive measure to reduce COVID-19 health risks. We utilize full information maximum likelihood (FIML) logistic regression to analyze COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a national sample of United States (US) adults (N = 2,022). Online survey data was collected between September 7th and October 3rd, 2021. Before weighting, the racial composition of the sample was as follows: Asian American (15.0 %), Black/African American (20.0 %), Hispanic/Latino (20.0 %), American Indian or Alaska Native (12.6 %), Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (12.5 %), and White (20.0 %). Informed by the Increasing Vaccination Model (IVM), we assessed the relationship between COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and experiences of racial discrimination (Krieger’s 9-item measure). Odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were greater for most younger age groups, women (OR = 1.96; 95 % CI[1.54, 2.49]), Black/African American respondents (OR = 1.68; 95 % CI[1.18, 2.39]), those with a high school education or less (OR = 1.46; 95 % CI[1.08, 1.98]), Independent (OR = 1.77; 95 % CI[1.34, 2.35]) or Republican political affiliation (OR = 2.69; 95 % CI[1.92, 3.79]), and prior COVID-19 infection (OR = 1.78; 95 % CI[1.29, 2.45]). Odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were 1.04 greater for every-one unit increase in lifetime experiences of racial discrimination (95 % CI[1.02, 1.05]). Odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were lower for Asian American respondents (OR = 0.682; 95 % CI[0.480, 0.969]), and those who had a primary care doctor had reduced odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (OR = 0.735; 95 % CI[0.542, 0.998). Our primary finding provides support for a link between experiences of racial discrimination and hesitancy towards a COVID-19 vaccine among US adults. We discuss implications for public health officials and future research.

AB  - While vaccination is generally considered efficient in protecting against transmissible diseases, the compliance is not complete in many countries. In this study, we investigate how an individual-specific factor – family size – affects the probability of getting vaccinated against COVID-19. To answer this research question, we focus on individuals above 50 years of age, who are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. The analysis uses the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe Corona wave, conducted in the summer of 2021. To identify the effect of family size on vaccination, we exploit an exogenous variation in the probability of having more than two children, due to the sex composition of two firstborns. We document that a larger family size increases the probability of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine among older individuals. This impact is economically and statistically significant. We propose several potential mechanisms behind this result and document that family size can be related to the higher probability of being exposed to the disease. This effect can be by knowing someone who tested positive for COVID-19 or had symptoms similar to it, and by network size and frequency of contact with children, before the outbreak of COVID-19.

AB  - Background
Significant disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality exist for Native American (NA) people, the majority of whom live in urban areas. COVID-19 vaccination is a key strategy for mitigating these disparities; however, vaccination disparities affect NA communities. The current study investigated COVID-19 vaccine decision-making before widespread vaccine rollout occurred, among urban NA communities. We aimed to understand vaccine decision-making factors to develop recommendations about COVID-19 vaccine outreach.
Methods
We conducted three in-depth virtual focus groups with 17 NA adults living in an urban community (Los Angeles County) between December 2020 and January 2021. Participants were recruited through NA community-based organizations and community stakeholders. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted using Atlas.ti.
Findings
Participants in this study identified two overarching themes with implications for health vaccination campaigns. First, participants described a need for tailored information and outreach, including NA vaccine outreach that addresses misconceptions about vaccine development to calm fears of experimentation and support communication of vaccine evidence specific to NA people. Second, participants suggested strategies to improve public health resources in the urban NA community, such as the need for unified, proactive communication across trusted NA entities, navigation support to improve vaccine accessibility, and adequately resourcing health partnerships with and among trusted NA community agencies for improved reach.
Conclusion
In this qualitative study, we found that urban NA participants reported several factors that affected their vaccine decision-making, including a lack of tailored information for their communities. Our findings also underscore the need to work with tribes, tribal leadership, and urban NA serving organizations to coordinate vaccine communication and distribution to urban communities where the majority of NAs now reside. Further, these findings have implications for COVID-19 vaccine outreach among urban NA communities and demonstrate the need for clear and tailored engagement about the COVID-19 vaccine.

AB  - Summary
The assessment of the efficacy and safety of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in actual practice is extremely important, and monitoring efforts are being implemented worldwide. In Japan, a joint council in the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is held every two to three weeks to summarise information on the adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination, with careful assessment of individual case safety reports and comparison with background incidence rates. In 2021, the joint council mainly reviewed anaphylaxis, death, myocarditis/pericarditis, and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. These activities resulted in several safety-related regulatory actions, including the revision of vaccine package inserts with warnings about myocarditis/pericarditis. International sharing of vaccine safety information, as well as details of the evaluation systems, is important for international discussion and decision-making on better safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - Excess mortality during the COVID-19 epidemic is a crucial indicator of the health effects. We examined mortality records from government sources in Jakarta, Indonesia, from January 2015 to October 2020: 1) burials in public cemeteries; 2) civil registration of deaths; and 3) registration of deaths by health authorities. During 2015-2019, there were an average of 26,342 burials per year between January and October. During the same time frame in 2020, there were 42,460 burials, a 61% increase. Two months before the first official laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Indonesia in March 2020, a surge in burials began in early January 2020. In 2020, an examination of civil death registrations or health authority death registrations revealed insensitive trends. Both the characterization and management of the health crisis in Jakarta are clouded by insufficient laboratory diagnostic and death surveillance capabilities. The public burials data described may serve as a useful indicator of mortality impacts and the efficacy of epidemic interventions.

AB  - Objectives
We used publicly available population data from 1 January 2019 up to 31 December 2022, to investigate mortality trends in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic, evaluating changes in life expectancy (LE) at birth within provinces and the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations.
Study design
Aggregate data analysis.
Methods
Annual period life tables were used to estimate sex-specific LEs within provinces from 2019 to 2022. We used Arriaga decomposition to analyze the contribution of age groups (<60 years and ≥60 years) to annual LE changes. We implemented a Quasi-Poisson regression model to estimate the number of averted deaths by the achieved COVID-19 vaccination rates from January 2021 up to December 2022, simulating a counterfactual scenario where vaccine doses were not administered.
Results
The results revealed geographical heterogeneity in annual LE changes across Italian provinces during the pandemic. By the end of 2022, LE was below the prepandemic levels in 88% of provinces for females and in 76% for males. In addition, we estimated that the achieved vaccination rates averted 460,831 deaths (95% confidence interval: 250,976–707,920), corresponding to a 25% reduction in expected all-cause mortality.
Conclusions
Overall, the study highlighted the significant role of COVID-19 vaccinations in averting a considerable number of deaths and improving LE. However, by the end of 2022, LE had not fully recovered to prepandemic levels in many provinces. This could be attributed to concurrent factors, including enduring COVID-19 pandemic effects, intense summer heat waves and early onset of seasonal flu. Further research and continuous monitoring are essential to fully comprehend long-term mortality trends and optimize public health strategies.

AB  - Summary
Background
The first COVID-19 vaccine outside a clinical trial setting was administered on Dec 8, 2020. To ensure global vaccine equity, vaccine targets were set by the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility and WHO. However, due to vaccine shortfalls, these targets were not achieved by the end of 2021. We aimed to quantify the global impact of the first year of COVID-19 vaccination programmes.
Methods
A mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission and vaccination was separately fit to reported COVID-19 mortality and all-cause excess mortality in 185 countries and territories. The impact of COVID-19 vaccination programmes was determined by estimating the additional lives lost if no vaccines had been distributed. We also estimated the additional deaths that would have been averted had the vaccination coverage targets of 20% set by COVAX and 40% set by WHO been achieved by the end of 2021.
Findings
Based on official reported COVID-19 deaths, we estimated that vaccinations prevented 14·4 million (95% credible interval [Crl] 13·7–15·9) deaths from COVID-19 in 185 countries and territories between Dec 8, 2020, and Dec 8, 2021. This estimate rose to 19·8 million (95% Crl 19·1–20·4) deaths from COVID-19 averted when we used excess deaths as an estimate of the true extent of the pandemic, representing a global reduction of 63% in total deaths (19·8 million of 31·4 million) during the first year of COVID-19 vaccination. In COVAX Advance Market Commitment countries, we estimated that 41% of excess mortality (7·4 million [95% Crl 6·8–7·7] of 17·9 million deaths) was averted. In low-income countries, we estimated that an additional 45% (95% CrI 42–49) of deaths could have been averted had the 20% vaccination coverage target set by COVAX been met by each country, and that an additional 111% (105–118) of deaths could have been averted had the 40% target set by WHO been met by each country by the end of 2021.
Interpretation
COVID-19 vaccination has substantially altered the course of the pandemic, saving tens of millions of lives globally. However, inadequate access to vaccines in low-income countries has limited the impact in these settings, reinforcing the need for global vaccine equity and coverage.

AB  - Contrary to the long-held belief that the effects of vaccines are specific for the disease they were created; compelling evidence has demonstrated that vaccines can exert positive or deleterious non-specific effects (NSEs). In this review, we compiled research reports from the last 40 years, which were found based on the PubMed search for the epidemiological and immunological studies on the non-specific effects (NSEs) of the most common human vaccines. Analysis of information showed that live vaccines induce positive NSEs, whereas non-live vaccines induce several negative NSEs, including increased female mortality associated with enhanced susceptibility to other infectious diseases, especially in developing countries. These negative NSEs are determined by the vaccination sequence, the antigen concentration in vaccines, the type of vaccine used (live vs. non-live), and also by repeated vaccination. We do not recommend stopping using non-live vaccines, as they have demonstrated to protect against their target disease, so the suggestion is that their detrimental NSEs can be minimized simply by changing the current vaccination sequence. High IgG4 antibody levels generated in response to repeated inoculation with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could be associated with a higher mortality rate from unrelated diseases and infections by suppressing the immune system. Since most COVID-19 vaccinated countries are reporting high percentages of excess mortality not directly attributable to deaths from such disease, the NSEs of mRNA vaccines on overall mortality should be studied in depth.

AB  - Objectives
The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term effectiveness of COVID-19 pandemic prevention measures in saving lives after European governments began to lift restrictions.
Study design
Excess mortality interrupted time series.
Methods
Country-level weekly data on deaths were fitted to the Poisson mixed linear model to estimate excess deaths. Based on this estimate, the percentage of excess deaths above the baseline during the pandemic (week 11 in 2020 to week 15 in 2022) (when public health interventions were in place) and during the post-pandemic period (week 16 in 2022 to week 52 in 2022) were calculated. These results were fitted to the linear regression model to determine any potential relationship between mortality during these two periods.
Results
The model used in this study had high predictive value (adjusted R2 = 59.4%). Mortality during the endemic (post-pandemic) period alone increased by 7.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.7, 8.6) above baseline, while each percentage increase in mortality during the pandemic corresponded to a 0.357% reduction (95% CI: 0.243, 0.471) in mortality during the post-pandemic period.
Conclusions
The most successful countries in terms of protective measures also experienced the highest mortality rates after restrictions were lifted. The model used in this study clearly shows a measure of bidirectional mortality displacement that is sufficiently clear to mask any impact of long COVID on overall mortality. Results from this study also seriously impact previous cost-benefit analyses of pandemic prevention measures, since, according to the current model, 12.2% (95% CI: 8.3, 16.1) of the gains achieved in pandemic containment were lost after restrictions were lifted.

AB  - According to United Nations, World Tourism Organization COVID-19 has had the most devastating impact on the entire global tourism value chain, which resulted in a 74% decline in international passenger arrival, a US$1.3 trillion loss in international tourism receipts, over the US $ 2trillion loss of global domestic product and placing between 100 and 120 million jobs at risk globally. While the initial impact of the pandemic was uniform across the world, the recovery was expected to be varied across the region due to inequitable access to the COVID-19 vaccine. This study seeks to examine the implications of vaccination inequity on tourism recovery in the global tourism market. The study uses secondary, archival data and harnesses the advantages of big data generated from online activities from tourists and tourism companies obtained from authoritative sources. The study found that inequitable access to vaccinations produced a skewed recovery favouring vaccinated regions concentrated in the developed world, leaving poor regions such as Africa behind. The robot system characterising the vaccine-induced recovery had also created a vaccine diplomatic nightmare that scuttled global tourism recovery efforts. To ensure sustainable recovery, there is a need to ensure global vaccination access by rechannelling some of the excess vaccines in developed countries to countries that needs them to ensure the opening up of the entire tourism global market and reduce vulnerabilities that are coming from COVID-19 variants, which poses a threat to the gains made from the current vaccination program. The study concludes that there will not be any meaningful economic recovery without a wholesale approach covering the entire global population.

AB  - Global debates about vaccines as a key element of pandemic response and future preparedness in the era of Covid-19 currently focus on questions of supply, with attention to global injustice in vaccine distribution and African countries as rightful beneficiaries of international de-regulation and financing initiatives such as COVAX. At the same time, vaccine demand and uptake are seen to be threatened by hesitancy, often attributed to an increasingly globalised anti-vaxx movement and its propagation of misinformation and conspiracy, now reaching African populations through a social media ‘infodemic’. Underplayed in these debates are the socio-political contexts through which vaccine technologies enter and are interpreted within African settings, and the crucial intersections between supply and demand. We explore these through a ‘vaccine anxieties’ framework attending to both desires for and worries about vaccines, as shaped by bodily, societal and wider political understandings and experiences. This provides an analytical lens to organise and interpret ethnographic and narrative accounts in local and national settings in Uganda and Sierra Leone, and their (dis)connections with global debates and geopolitics. In considering the socially-embedded reasons why people want or do not want Covid-19 vaccines, and how this intersects with the dynamics of vaccine supply, access and distribution in rapidly-unfolding epidemic situations, we bring new, expanded insights into debates about vaccine confidence and vaccine preparedness.
