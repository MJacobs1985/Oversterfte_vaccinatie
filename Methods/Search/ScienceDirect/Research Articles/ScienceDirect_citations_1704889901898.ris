AB  - We analyze the medium-term macroeconomic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lock-down measures on low-income countries. We focus on the impact of the degradation of health and human capital caused by the pandemic and its aftermath, exploring the trade-offs between rebuilding human capital and the recovery of livelihoods and macroeconomic sustainability. A dynamic general equilibrium model is calibrated to reflect the structural characteristics of vulnerable low-income countries and to replicate key dimensions of the Covid-19 shock. We show that absent significant and sustained external financing, the persistence of loss-of-learning effects on labor productivity is likely to make the post-Covid recovery more attenuated and more expensive than many contemporary analysis suggests.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that has significant implications for the cardiovascular care of patients. First, those with COVID-19 and pre-existing cardiovascular disease have an increased risk of severe disease and death. Second, infection has been associated with multiple direct and indirect cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. Third, therapies under investigation for COVID-19 may have cardiovascular side effects. Fourth, the response to COVID-19 can compromise the rapid triage of non-COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular conditions. Finally, the provision of cardiovascular care may place health care workers in a position of vulnerability as they become hosts or vectors of virus transmission. We hereby review the peer-reviewed and pre-print reports pertaining to cardiovascular considerations related to COVID-19 and highlight gaps in knowledge that require further study pertinent to patients, health care workers, and health systems.

AB  - This article investigates the spatial patterns of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection in Italy and its determinants from March 9 to June 15, 2020, a time interval covering the so‐called first wave of COVID pandemics in Europe. The results, based on negative binomial regressions and linear spatial models, confirm the importance of multiple factors that positively correlate with the number of recorded cases. Economic forces, including urban agglomeration, industrial districts, concentration of large companies (both before and after the beginning of the ‘lockdown’) and a north–south gradient, are the most significant predictors of the strength of COVID‐19 infection. These effects are statistically more robust in the spatial models than in the aspatial ones. We interpretate our results in the light of pitfalls related to data reliability, and we discuss policy implications and possible avenues for future research.

AB  - Brucellosis, caused by Brucella, is one of the most common zoonosis. However, there is still no vaccine for human use. Although some live attenuated vaccines have been approved for animals, the protection effect is not ideal. In this study, we developed a dual-antigen nanoconjugate vaccine containing both polysaccharide and protein antigens against Brucella. First, the antigenic polysaccharide was covalently coupled to the outer membrane protein Omp19 using protein glycan coupling technology, and then it was successfully loaded on a nano-carrier through the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system. After confirming the efficient immune activation and safety performance of the dual-antigen nanoconjugate vaccine, the potent serum antibody response against the two antigens and remarkable protective effect in non-lethal and lethal Brucella infection models were further demonstrated through different routes of administration. These results indicated that the dual-antigen nanoconjugate vaccine enhanced both T helper 1 cell (Th1) and Th2 immune responses and protected mice from Brucella infection. Furthermore, we found that this protective effect was maintained for at least 18 weeks. To our knowledge, this is the first Brucella vaccine bearing diverse antigens, including a protein and polysaccharide, on a single nanoparticle. Thus, we also present an attractive technology for co-delivery of different types of antigens using a strategy applicable to other vaccines against infectious diseases.

AB  - Dawn to sunset fasting, a type of intermittent fasting commonly practiced in the month of Ramadan, requires abstinence from food and drink from dawn to sunset. Dawn and dusk are two transition time zones of the day that play a critical role in the human circadian rhythm. Practicing dawn to sunset fasting requires the alignment of mealtimes and wake-sleep times with the human biological dawn and dusk. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) impairs immune cell responses at multiple levels and leads to severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). It generates high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, also known as a cytokine storm, leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and generation of excessive amounts of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, downregulates autophagy to escape detection for unchecked replication, and alters gut microbiome composition. Severe cases of COVID-19 have been associated with several comorbidities that impair immune responses (e.g., obesity, diabetes, malignancy) and blood laboratory abnormalities (e.g., elevated procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, leukocytosis, lymphopenia). Several studies of dawn to sunset fasting showed anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing several pro-inflammatory cytokines, reducing oxidative stress, inducing a proteome response associated with increased autophagy, remodeling the gut microbiome, and improving the components of metabolic syndrome (e.g., obesity, blood glucose levels, blood pressure, lipids). In conclusion, dawn to sunset fasting has the potential to optimize the immune system function against SARS‐CoV‐2 during the COVID-19 pandemic as it suppresses chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, improves metabolic profile, and remodels the gut microbiome. This review presents scientific literature related to the effects of dawn to sunset fasting on the immune system. Studies are needed to assess and confirm the potential benefits of dawn to sunset fasting against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic and the World War 2 aerial bombing campaign against the UK between 1939 and 1945 both exposed the civilian population to a sustained threat. Risk, whether from exposure to viral load or the density of the bombing, led to a range of protective measures and behavioural regulations being implemented. The V1 and V2 missiles used in summer and autumn, 1944, functioned as a second wave of bombing, arriving after people believed the danger had passed. Adherence to lockdown and a reluctance to return to work after the lifting of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK were mirrored in the preference for using home-based bomb shelters during the air raids. Heightened sensitivity to risk, or a so-called deep shelter mentality, did not materialise even during the second wave of bomb attacks and some deep bomb shelters were closed because of low occupancy. The most popular protective measures were those that reflected people's preferences, and not necessarily those that provided the greatest safety. As with the COVID-19 pandemic, the public drove government policy as much as they followed it.

AB  - Here, in Part II of a duology on the characterization and potential treatment for COVID-19, we characterize the application of an innovative treatment regimen for the prevention of the transition from mild to severe COVID-19, as well as detail an intensive immunotherapy intervention hypothesis. We propose as a putative randomized controlled trial that high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin (HDMTX-LR) rescue can abolish ‘PANIC’, thereby ‘left-shifting’ severe COVID-19 patients to the group majority of those infected with SARS-CoV-2, who are designated as having mild, even asymptomatic, disease. HDMTX-LR is endowed with broadly pleiotropic properties and is a repurposed, generic, inexpensive, and widely available agent which can be administered early in the course of severe COVID-19 thus rescuing the critical and irreplaceable gas-exchange alveoli. Further, we describe a preventative treatment intervention regimen for those designated as having mild to moderate COVID-19 disease, but who exhibit features which herald the transition to the severe variant of this disease. Both of our proposed hypothesis-driven questions should be urgently subjected to rigorous assessment in the context of randomized controlled trials, in order to confirm or refute the contention that the approaches characterized herein, are in fact capable of exerting mitigating, if not abolishing, effects upon SARS-CoV-2 triggered ‘PANIC Attack’. Confirmation of our immunotherapy hypothesis would have far-reaching ramifications for the current pandemic, along with yielding invaluable lessons which could be leveraged to more effectively prepare for the next challenge to global health.

AB  - The global crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) affected economics, social affairs, and the environment, not to mention public health. It is estimated that near 82% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome. The purpose of the review is to highlight how the virus is impacted by the environment and how the virus has impacted the environment. This review was based on an electronic search of the literature in the Scopus, Science Direct, and PubMed database published from December 2019 to July 2020 using combinations of the following keywords: SARS-CoV-2 transmission, COVID-19 transmission, coronavirus transmission, waterborne, wastewater, airborne, solid waste, fomites, and fecal-oral transmission. Studies suggest the thermal properties of ambient air, as well as relative humidity, may affect the transmissibility and viability of the virus. Samples taken from the wastewater collection network were detected contaminated with the novel coronavirus; consequently, there is a concern of its transmission via an urban sewer system. There are concerns about the efficacy of the wastewater treatment plant disinfection process as the last chance to inactivate the virus. Handling solid waste also requires an utmost caution as it may contain infectious masks, etc. Following the PRISMA approach, among all reviewed studies, more than 36% of them were directly or indirectly related to the indoor and outdoor environment, 16% to meteorological factors, 11% to wastewater, 14% to fomites, 8% to water, 9% to solid waste, and 6% to the secondary environment. The still growing body of literature on COVID-19 and air, suggests the importance of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via air and indoor air quality, especially during lockdown interventions. Environmental conditions are found to be a factor in transmitting the virus beyond geographical borders. Accordingly, countries need to pay extra attention to sustainable development themes and goals.

In many cases, as observed the plasma antibodies have cured the disease. Therefore, a four-echelon supply chain has been designed in this study to locate the blood collection centers, to find out how the collection centers are allocated to the temporary or permanent plasma-processing facilities, how the temporary facilities are allocated to the permanent ones, along with determining the allocation of the temporary and permanent facilities to hospitals. A simulation approach has been employed to investigate the structure of COVID-19 outbreak and to simulate the quantity of plasma demand. The proposed bi-objective model has been solved in small and medium scales using ɛ-constraint method, Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm II (SPEA-II), Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimizer (MOGWO) and Multi Objective Invasive Weed Optimization algorithm (MOIWO) approaches. One of the novelties of this research is to study the system dynamic structure of COVID-19’s prevalence so that to estimate the required plasma level by simulation. Besides, this paper has focused on blood substitutability which is becoming increasingly important for timely access to blood. Due to shorter computational time and higher solution quality, MOIWO is selected to solve the proposed model for a large-scale case study in Iran. The achieved results indicated that as the plasma demand increases, the amount of total system costs and flow time rise, too. The proposed simulation model has also been able to calculate the required plasma demand with 95% confidence interval.

AB  - Background
From February 2020, both urban and rural Ireland witnessed the rapid proliferation of the COVID-19 disease throughout its counties. During this period, the national COVID-19 responses included stay-at-home directives issued by the state, subject to varying levels of enforcement.
Methods
In this paper, we present a new method to assess and rank the causes of Ireland COVID-19 deaths as it relates to mobility activities within each county provided by Google while taking into consideration the epidemiological confirmed positive cases reported per county. We used a network structure and rank propagation modelling approach using Personalised PageRank to reveal the importance of each mobility category linked to cases and deaths. Then a novel feature-selection method using relative prominent factors finds important features related to each county's death. Finally, we clustered the counties based on features selected with the network results using a customised network clustering algorithm for the research problem.
Findings
Our analysis reveals that the most important mobility trend categories that exhibit the strongest association to COVID-19 cases and deaths include retail and recreation and workplaces. This is the first time a network structure and rank propagation modelling approach has been used to link COVID-19 data to mobility patterns. The infection determinants landscape illustrated by the network results aligns soundly with county socio-economic and demographic features. The novel feature selection and clustering method presented clusters useful to policymakers, managers of the health sector, politicians and even sociologists. Finally, each county has a different impact on the national total.

AB  - Summary
SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells will likely prove critical for long-term immune protection against COVID-19. Here, we systematically mapped the functional and phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in unexposed individuals, exposed family members, and individuals with acute or convalescent COVID-19. Acute-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a highly activated cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical markers of disease severity, whereas convalescent-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were polyfunctional and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative exposed family members and convalescent individuals with a history of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits broadly directed and functionally replete memory T cell responses, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19.

Because dietary habits are one of the most important modifiable risk factors for inflammation, identification of dietary components associated with inflammation could play a significant role in controlling or reducing the risk of COVID-19. We investigated the inflammatory potential of diets consumed by African American (AA) and Caucasian American (CA) women of childbearing age (n = 509) who are at high risk for exposure to COVID-19 by being residents of Birmingham, Alabama, a city severely affected by this pandemic. The overall pro- and anti- inflammatory scores were calculated using dietary intake data gathered using Block food frequency questionnaire. The proinflammatory potential of diets consumed by AAs was significantly higher compared to CAs. Several anti- and proinflammatory nutrients and food groups consumed differed by race. With consumption of a greater number of antioxidants and B-vitamins, CAs switched toward an anti-inflammatory score more effectively than AAs while AAs performed better than CAs in improving the anti-inflammatory score with the consumption of a greater number of minerals and vitamin D. Effective race-specific dietary modifications or supplementation with nutrients identified will be useful to improve proinflammatory diets toward anti-inflammatory. This approach could aid in controlling the current COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics of a similar nature in women at risk for exposure.

AB  - Introduction
There are few published empirical data on the effects of COVID‐19 on mental health, and until now, there is no large international study.
Material and methods
During the COVID-19 pandemic, an online questionnaire gathered data from 55,589 participants from 40 countries (64.85% females aged 35.80 ± 13.61; 34.05% males aged 34.90±13.29 and 1.10% other aged 31.64±13.15). Distress and probable depression were identified with the use of a previously developed cut-off and algorithm respectively.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated. Chi-square tests, multiple forward stepwise linear regression analyses and Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tested relations among variables.
Results
Probable depression was detected in 17.80% and distress in 16.71%. A significant percentage reported a deterioration in mental state, family dynamics and everyday lifestyle. Persons with a history of mental disorders had higher rates of current depression (31.82% vs. 13.07%). At least half of participants were accepting (at least to a moderate degree) a non-bizarre conspiracy. The highest Relative Risk (RR) to develop depression was associated with history of Bipolar disorder and self-harm/attempts (RR = 5.88). Suicidality was not increased in persons without a history of any mental disorder. Based on these results a model was developed.
Conclusions
The final model revealed multiple vulnerabilities and an interplay leading from simple anxiety to probable depression and suicidality through distress. This could be of practical utility since many of these factors are modifiable. Future research and interventions should specifically focus on them.

AB  - Background
The normal ageing process is accompanied by immunosenescence and a progressive weakening of the immune system. High-dose inactivated influenza quadrivalent vaccine (HD-QIV) has shown greater immunogenicity, relative efficacy, and effectiveness than the standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent vaccine (SD-QIV). The aim of the study was to assess the cost-utility of an HD-QIV strategy compared with an adjuvanted trivalent inactivated vaccine (aTIV) strategy in the population above 65 years of age in Spain.
Methods
We evaluated the public health and economic benefits of alternatives by using a decision-tree model, which included influenza cases, visits to the general practitioner (GP), visits to the emergency department (ED), hospitalisations, and mortality related to influenza. We performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to account for both epidemiological and economical sources of uncertainty.
Results
Our results show that switching from aTIV strategy to HD-QIV would prevent 36,476 cases of influenza, 5,143 visits to GP, 1,054 visits to the ED, 9,193 episodes of hospitalisation due to influenza or pneumonia, and 357 deaths due to influenza – increasing 3,514 life-years and 3,167 quality–adjusted life–years (QALYs). Healthcare costs increase by €78,874,301, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €24,353/QALY. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the results are rather robust.
Conclusion
Our analysis shows that HD-QIV in people over 65 years of age is an influenza-prevention strategy that is at least cost-effective, if not dominant, in Spain. It reduces cases of influenza, GP visits, hospitalisations, deaths, and associated healthcare costs.

AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected societies across the world while its economic impact has cut deeper than any recession since the Second World War. Climate change is potentially an even more disruptive and complex global challenge. Climate change could cause social and economic damage far larger than that caused by COVID-19. The current pandemic has highlighted the extent to which societies need to prepare for disruptive global environmental crises. Although the dynamics of combating COVID-19 and climate change are different, the priorities for action are the same: behavioral change, international cooperation to manage shared challenges, and technology's role in advancing solutions. For a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 crisis to be durable and resilient, a return to ‘business as usual’ and the subsequent often environmentally destructive economic activities must be avoided as they have significantly contributed to climate change. To avoid this, we draw lessons from the experiences of the waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond to advance sustainable development.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the development trajectories of several world economies with India being no exception. The country presently is the second worst affected in terms of total infections despite inducing a nationwide lockdown in the initial stages. In addition to curtailing infection spread, ensuring food security during and post pandemic is a major concern for the country owing to the high percentage of stunting and undernourishment already present and a relatively high proportion of vulnerable workforce with no regular source of income amidst the lockdown. The present article therefore ascertains the impact of the pandemic on the food systems which can potentially affect food security in the country as well as the government introduced reforms and policy measures to tackle them. Following the analysis, we suggest measures like digitally enhancing connectivity of neighbourhood retail or ‘Kirana’ stores in urban and rural areas, distribution of therapeutic foods and immune supplements among the impoverished societal sections through existing government schemes and promotion of ‘planetary healthy diets’ for overcoming food-insecurity while increasing nutrition security and ensuring long term food sector sustainability.

AB  - Foresight methodologies enable individuals and organizations to envision different future scenarios and plan for greater future resilience. However, foresight is an underused methodology in the Western Pacific region for health policy development that could be extremely beneficial, among other areas, in the context of public health emergency response. We present lessons learned from the application of foresight methodologies through remote, agile think tank sprints to inform the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Regional Office's (WPRO) response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Four think tanks were set up in topic areas of interest. The think tanks used a six-step foresight methodology to develop scenarios for the pandemic in an 18-month horizon. Backcasting was used to generate recommendations for WHO response and support for countries. This case study demonstrates the value of using foresight methodologies in public health, and specifically in the context of a public health emergency, and its ability to inform more context-appropriate and future-proof responses.

AB  - The objective of this “proof-of-concept” study was to evaluate the synergistic effect of a subunit microparticulate vaccine and microneedles (MN) assisted vaccine delivery system against a human coronavirus. Here, we formulated PLGA polymeric microparticles (MPs) encapsulating spike glycoprotein (GP) of SARS-CoV as the model antigen. Similarly, we formulated adjuvant MPs encapsulating Alhydrogel® and AddaVax™. The antigen/adjuvant MPs were characterized and tested in vitro for immunogenicity. We found that the antigen/adjuvant MPs were non-cytotoxic in vitro. The spike GP MPs + Alhydrogel® MPs + AddaVax™ MPs showed enhanced immunogenicity in vitro as confirmed through the release of nitrite, autophagy, and antigen presenting molecules with their co-stimulatory molecules. Next, we tested the in vivo efficacy of the spike GP MP vaccine with and without adjuvant MPs in mice vaccinated using MN. The spike GP MPs + Alhydrogel® MPs + AddaVax™ MPs induced heightened spike GP-specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies in mice. Also, spike GP MPs + Alhydrogel® MPs + AddaVax™ MPs enhanced expression of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in secondary lymphoid organ like spleen. These results indicated spike GP-specific humoral immunity and cellular immunity in vivo. Thus, we employed the benefits of both the subunit vaccine MPs and dissolving MN to form a non-invasive and effective vaccination strategy against human coronaviruses.

AB  - Background and Aims
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has limited endoscopy utilization, causing significant health and economic losses. We aim to model the impact of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing into resuming endoscopy practice.
Methods
We performed a retrospective review of endoscopy utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic for a baseline reference. A computer model compared 3 approaches: strategy 1, endoscopy for urgent indications only; strategy 2, testing for semiurgent indications; and strategy 3, testing all patients. Analysis was made under current COVID-19 prevalence and projected prevalence of 5% and 10%. Primary outcomes were number of procedures performed and/or canceled. Secondary outcomes were direct costs, reimbursement, personal protective equipment used, and personnel infected. Disease prevalence, testing accuracy, and costs were obtained from the literature.
Results
During the COVID-19 pandemic, endoscopy volume was 12.7% of expected. Strategies 2 and 3 were safe and effective interventions to resume endoscopy in semiurgent and elective cases. Investing 22 U.S. dollars (USD) and 105 USD in testing per patient allowed the completion of 19.4% and 95.3% of baseline endoscopies, respectively. False-negative results were seen after testing 4700 patients (or 3 months of applying strategy 2 in our practice). Implementing PCR testing over 1 week in the United States would require 13 and 64 million USD, with a return of 165 and 767 million USD to providers, leaving 65 and 325 healthcare workers infected.
Conclusions
PCR testing is an effective strategy to restart endoscopic practice in the United States. PCR screening should be implemented during the second phase of the pandemic, once the healthcare system is able to test and isolate all suspected COVID-19 cases.

AB  - Currently, the world has been devastated by an unprecedented pandemic in this century. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been causing disorders, dysfunction and morphophysiological alterations in multiple organs as the disease evolves. There is a great scientific community effort to obtain a therapy capable of reaching the multiple affected organs in order to contribute for tissue repair and regeneration. In this regard, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as potential candidates concerning the promotion of beneficial actions at different stages of COVID-19. MSCs are promising due to the observed therapeutic effects in respiratory preclinical models, as well as in cardiac, vascular, renal and nervous system models. Their immunomodulatory properties and secretion of paracrine mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and extracellular vesicles allow for long range tissue modulation and, particularly, blood-brain barrier crossing. This review focuses on SARS-CoV-2 impact to lungs, kidneys, heart, vasculature and central nervous system while discussing promising MSC's therapeutic mechanisms in each tissue. In addition, MSC's therapeutic effects in high-risk groups for COVID-19, such as obese, diabetic and hypertensive patients are also explored.

AB  - Background
Best practice for prevention, diagnosis, and management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is unknown due to limited published data in this population.
Objectives
We aimed to assess current global practice and experience in management of COVID‐19–associated coagulopathy to identify information to guide prospective and randomized studies.
Methods
Physicians were queried about their current approach to prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with COVID‐19 using an online survey tool distributed through multiple international organizations between April 10 and 14, 2020.
Results
Five hundred fifteen physicians from 41 countries responded. The majority of respondents (78%) recommended prophylactic anticoagulation for all hospitalized patients with COVID‐19, with most recommending use of low‐molecular‐weight heparin or unfractionated heparin. Significant practice variation was found regarding the need for dose escalation of anticoagulation outside the setting of confirmed or suspected VTE. Respondents reported the use of bedside testing when unable to perform standard diagnostic imaging for diagnosis of VTE. Two hundred ninety‐one respondents reported observing thrombotic complications in their patients, with 64% noting that the complication was pulmonary embolism. Of the 44% of respondents who estimated incidence of thrombosis in patients with COVID‐19 in their hospital, estimates ranged widely from 1% to 50%. One hundred seventy‐four respondents noted bleeding complications (34% minor bleeding, 14% clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, and 12% major bleeding).
Conclusion
Well‐designed epidemiologic studies are urgently needed to understand the incidence and risk factors of VTE and bleeding complications in patients with COVID‐19. Randomized clinical trials addressing use of anticoagulation are also needed.Unlabelled Image

AB  - Early diagnosis and ultrahigh sample throughput screening are the need of the hour to control the geological spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional laboratory tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and computed tomography are implemented for the detection of COVID-19. However, they are limited by the laborious sample collection and processing procedures, longer wait time for test results and skilled technicians to operate sophisticated facilities. In this context, the point of care (PoC) diagnostic platform has proven to be the prospective approach in addressing the abovementioned challenges. This review emphasizes the mechanism of viral infection spread detailing the host-virus interaction, pathophysiology, and the recent advances in the development of affordable PoC diagnostic platforms for rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. First, the well-established optical and electrochemical biosensors are discussed. Subsequently, the recent advances in the development of PoC biosensors, including lateral flow immunoassays and other emerging techniques, are highlighted. Finally, a focus on integrating nanotechnology with wearables and smartphones to develop smart nanobiosensors is outlined, which could promote COVID-19 diagnosis accessible to both individuals and the mass population at patient care.

AB  - Introduction: The NHLBI MDS Natural History Study (NCT02775383) is an ongoing prospective cohort study conducted across 144 sites in the U.S. and Israel intended to establish a data and biospecimen repository to advance the understanding of MDS. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study also collected data on COVID-19 infection and management. Here, we report a summary of COVID-19 outcomes from participants in this study and the impact of the pandemic on study operations. Methods: This prospective cohort study initiated in June, 2016 is enrolling patients (pts) undergoing diagnostic work up for suspected or newly diagnosed MDS or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in the setting of cytopenia. Study enrollment was paused from Mar. 27, 2020 to May 18, 2020 due to COVID-19. Previously untreated pts underwent a bone marrow assessment with a centralized histopathology review at enrollment for assignment to a longitudinal cohort (MDS, MDS/MPN overlap, idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with <30% blasts, or “At-Risk” (pts with sub-threshold dysplasia, select karyotype, or select genetic mutations) for follow-up every six months; or a cross-sectional cohort (other cytopenia or cancers) with no further follow-up. COVID-19 outcomes, including tests, status, hospitalizations and treatments for COVID-19, were collected for all eligible pts. Protocol deviations related to COVID-19 were also collected. Fisher's exact test was used for comparing the proportions of pts tested or positive between groups. Results: Of 758 eligible pts with available COVID-19 data, 507 (67%) were assigned to the longitudinal cohort and 251 (33%) to the cross-sectional cohort or are pending assignment. Among longitudinal pts, 74 (15%) had ICUS, 240 (47%) MDS, 47 (9%) MDS/MPN overlap, 11 (2%) AML with <30% blasts, and 135 (27%) At-Risk for MDS. The median age over all pts was 72 years (range=21-95) and 66% were male, 92% White, 4% Black, 2% Asian, and 2% other. Among 244 pts (32%) tested for COVID-19 (Table 1), 23 (9%) were positive. Twelve (>50% of the positive pts) were in Wisconsin, California (CA), and Missouri (Figure 1), with 8 identified from Sep. to Dec. 2020, which overlaps with third waves of COVID-19 reported in CA and in the Midwest. Tests from 17 (74%) of the 23 pts were based on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The proportion of pts positive were similar between pooled disease (ICUS, MDS, MDS/MPN, AML <30%), At-Risk, and cross-sectional groups (8%, 8%, 16%, respectively; Table 2) but the proportions tested differed significantly (39%, 28%, and 25%, respectively, p=0.004). Among all positive pts, 21 (91%) are recovering or have recovered (16 with sequelae), 1 (4%) died, and 1 outcome is unknown (Table 1). The one participant who died had MDS with excess blasts-1 (MDS-EB1, 5-9% blasts). Eight pts (35% of positive pts) required hospitalization (median duration of 7 days (range=2-17)) or treatment (tx) in response to COVID-19, 7 of whom required both. In the 8 pts who required tx for COVID-19, 4 reported Remdesivir-use, 3 of whom were diagnosed with MDS or MDS/MPN overlap. The study monthly accrual rates were similar when compared pre- vs. post-study pause (23 vs. 22 pts, respectively) but the rate of missed follow-up visits increased from 5% to 11% post-pause. About half (49%) of the 144 COVID-19-related study deviations occurred during the months the study was paused. Conclusions: In this analysis of 758 pts with MDS and related conditions, the largest reported for these diagnoses, the COVID-19 mortality rate (13%) in MDS was lower than has been reported in a smaller (n=61) case study (39%, Feld et al Blood 2020) but is similar to the rates for MDS observed annually each year prior to study pause (range=11-19%) and to the rate reported in a larger (n=2186) observational study of cancer patients (16%, Rivera et al Cancer Discov 2020). Infection rates were similar across disease groups. The pandemic also resulted in substantial study-specific challenges, including increased rate of deviations, the study being paused, and difficulty sourcing material for biospecimen processing. Data on vaccine efficacy and rates of pts with long-haul symptoms post-COVID may be of interest in future work. Figure 1

AB  - Dexamethasone, a widely used corticosteroid, has recently been reported as the first drug to increase the survival chances of patients with severe COVID-19. Therapeutic agents, including dexamethasone, are mostly transported through the body by binding to serum albumin. Here, the first structure of serum albumin in complex with dexamethasone is reported. Dexamethasone binds to drug site 7, which is also the binding site for commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and testosterone, suggesting potentially problematic binding competition. This study bridges structural findings with an analysis of publicly available clinical data from Wuhan and suggests that an adjustment of the dexamethasone regimen should be further investigated as a strategy for patients affected by two major COVID-19 risk factors: low albumin levels and diabetes.

AB  - This paper analyses the risk-adjusted performance of Islamic and conventional equity funds during the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that Islamic equity funds demonstrated differentials in risk-adjusted performance, investment styles, and volatility timing compared to their conventional counterparts. Specifically, the results revealed that Islamic equity funds are more resilient to COVID-19 shock since they outperformed non-Islamic peers during the peak months of the pandemic. The trend continues even when the spread smoothens. These findings confirm the safe-haven properties of Islamic equity funds, which is helpful for investors aiming to hedge pandemic risks. The style analysis reveals investment drift from riskier styles to more prudent options in response to each stage's uncertainties. The results suggest policymakers should further investigate Islamic financial assets and their underlying principles to improve the resilience of economic systems in any future black swan events.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 raised numerous questions on the interactions between the occurrence of new infections, the environment, climate and health. The European Union requested the H2020 HERA project which aims at setting priorities in research on environment, climate and health, to identify relevant research needs regarding Covid-19. The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be related to urbanization, habitat destruction, live animal trade, intensive livestock farming and global travel. The contribution of climate and air pollution requires additional studies. Importantly, the severity of COVID-19 depends on the interactions between the viral infection, ageing and chronic diseases such as metabolic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and obesity which are themselves influenced by environmental stressors. The mechanisms of these interactions deserve additional scrutiny. Both the pandemic and the social response to the disease have elicited an array of behavioural and societal changes that may remain long after the pandemic and that may have long term health effects including on mental health. Recovery plans are currently being discussed or implemented and the environmental and health impacts of those plans are not clearly foreseen. Clearly, COVID-19 will have a long-lasting impact on the environmental health field and will open new research perspectives and policy needs.

AB  - Patients with cancer have a well-known and higher risk of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). VPDs may cause severe complications in this setting due to immune system impairment, malnutrition and oncological treatments. Despite this evidence, vaccination rates are inadequate. The Italian Association of Medical Oncology [Associazione Italiana di Oncologia Medica (AIOM)] has been involved in vaccination awareness since 2014. Based on a careful review of the available data about the immunogenicity, effectiveness and safety of flu, pneumococcal and anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, we report the recommendations of the AIOM about these vaccinations in adult patients with solid tumors. The AIOM recommends comprehensive education on the issue of VPDs. We believe that a multidisciplinary care model may improve the vaccination coverage in immunocompromised patients. Continued surveillance, implementation of preventive practices and future well-designed immunological prospective studies are essential for better management of our patients with cancer.

AB  - Chitosan (CS) is a natural polymer derived from chitin that has wide applications in drugs, vaccines, and antigen delivery. The distinctive mucoadhesive, biocompatibility, biodegradable, and less toxic properties of chitosan compared to the currently used vaccine adjuvants made it a promising candidate for use as an adjuvant/carrier in vaccine delivery. In addition, chitosan exhibits intrinsic immunomodulating properties making it a suitable adjuvant in preparing vaccines delivery systems. Nanoparticles (NPs) of chitosan and its derivatives loaded with antigen have been shown to induce cellular and humoral responses. Versatility in the physicochemical properties of chitosan can provide an excellent opportunity to engineer antigen-specific adjuvant/delivery systems. This review discusses the recent advances of chitosan and its derivatives as adjuvants in vaccine deliveryand the published literature in the last fifteen years. The impact of physicochemical properties of chitosan on vaccine formulation has been described in detail. Applications of chitosan and its derivatives, their physicochemical properties, and mechanisms in enhancing immune responses have been discussed. Finally, challenges and future aspects of chitosan use has been pointed out.

This paper explores how COVID-19 could impact the success of meeting the targets with priority given to the four ‘foundational’ goals: SDG 1 No Poverty; SDG3 Good Health; SDG 14 Life Below Water and SDG 15 Life on Land as these are critical in maintaining a healthy human and environmental resource base on which progress towards all goals can be built. A scenario analysis examines futures across a spectrum in which i) social and health imperatives (lives) dominate, to ii) where economic imperatives (livelihoods) take precedence. Similarly levels of international co-operation are considered ranging from international recognition of urgent global agendas to fragmentation due to the isolation of individual states around national priorities. These give rise to 4 scenarios: a) Global Well-being Prioritized b) World Trade Recovers c) Poverty Gaps Widen c) Earth Systems in Danger and the likelihood of achieving the foundational SDGs in each is discussed. The paper concludes opportunities exist to refocus efforts on delivery of the SDGs but may be hampered by the competing interests of a new geopolitics.

AB  - ABSTRACT
The importance of balanced dietary habits, which include appropriate amounts of antioxidants to maintain the immune system, has become increasingly relevant during the current SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic, because viral infections are characterized by high oxidative stress. Furthermore, the measures taken by governments to control the pandemic have led to increased anxiety, stress, and depression, which affect physical and mental health, all of which are influenced by nutritional status, diet, and lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet (MD), Atlantic diet (AD), and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans all provide the essential vitamins, minerals, and phenolic compounds needed to activate enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant responses. However, viral pandemics such as the current COVID-19 crisis entail high oxidative damage caused by both the infection and the resultant social stresses within populations, which increases the probability and severity of infection. Balanced dietary patterns such as the MD and the AD are characterized by the consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, olive oil, and whole grains with low intakes of processed foods and red meat. For a healthy lifestyle in young adults, the MD in particular provides the required amount of antioxidants per day for vitamins D (0.3–3.8 μg), E (17.0 mg), C (137.2–269.8 mg), A (1273.3 μg), B-12 (1.5–2.0 μg), and folate (455.1–561.3 μg), the minerals Se (120.0 μg), Zn (11.0 mg), Fe (15.0–18.8 mg), and Mn (5.2–12.5 mg), and polyphenols (1171.00 mg) needed to maintain an active immune response. However, all of these diets are deficient in the recommended amount of vitamin D (20 μg/d). Therefore, vulnerable populations such as elders and obese individuals could benefit from antioxidant supplementation to improve their antioxidant response. Although evidence remains scarce, there is some indication that a healthy diet, along with supplemental antioxidant intake, is beneficial to COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Forecasting the outcome of outbreaks as early and as accurately as possible is crucial for decision-making and policy implementations. A significant challenge faced by forecasters is that not all outbreaks and epidemics turn into pandemics, making the prediction of their severity difficult. At the same time, the decisions made to enforce lockdowns and other mitigating interventions versus their socioeconomic consequences are not only hard to make, but also highly uncertain. The majority of modeling approaches to outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics take an epidemiological approach that considers biological and disease processes. In this paper, we accept the limitations of forecasting to predict the long-term trajectory of an outbreak, and instead, we propose a statistical, time series approach to modelling and predicting the short-term behavior of COVID-19. Our model assumes a multiplicative trend, aiming to capture the continuation of the two variables we predict (global confirmed cases and deaths) as well as their uncertainty. We present the timeline of producing and evaluating 10-day-ahead forecasts over a period of four months. Our simple model offers competitive forecast accuracy and estimates of uncertainty that are useful and practically relevant.

AB  - Although COVID-19 emerged as a global shock, governments adopted non-pharmaceutical policy responses that were rather heterogeneous, depending on cultural and institutional characteristics. At the country level, the stringency of ‘lockdown’-type policies should be set to achieve the best possible trade-off between economic and fatality dynamics, obviously accounting for possible cross-border influences. To allow for policy learning, I assume that the first country implementing a policy initiative that is worth emulating must either get the best possible health or the best possible economic outcome. I propose a combination of sign and magnitude restrictions, embedded in a global VAR model, to identify idiosyncratic policy shocks that spill over and influence policy responses abroad. Once policy shocks are identified, I run a comparison exercise between two model specifications, i.e. with and without policy emulation. Within a given a sample, this methodology can be used to find when and where policy lessons can be identified. I find that, among 17 developed and developing countries, few can offer lessons based on their policy initiatives, but several others might get better trade-offs through policy emulation, although in reality this outcome is not guaranteed to have occurred.

AB  - Being heavily dependent to oil products (mainly gasoline and diesel), the French transport sector is the main emitter of Particulate Matter (PMs) whose critical levels induce harmful health effects for urban inhabitants. We selected three major French cities (Paris, Lyon, and Marseille) to investigate the relationship between the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak and air pollution. Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) experiments, we have determined the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 linked to COVID-19-related deaths. Our focus is on the potential effects of Particulate Matter (PM) in spreading the epidemic. The underlying hypothesis is that a pre-determined particulate concentration can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection. The empirical strategy used an innovative Machine Learning (ML) methodology. In particular, through the so-called cutting technique in ANNs, we found new threshold levels of PM2.5 and PM10 connected to COVID-19: 17.4 µg/m3 (PM2.5) and 29.6 µg/m3 (PM10) for Paris; 15.6 µg/m3 (PM2.5) and 20.6 µg/m3 (PM10) for Lyon; 14.3 µg/m3 (PM2.5) and 22.04 µg/m3 (PM10) for Marseille. Interestingly, all the threshold values identified by the ANNs are higher than the limits imposed by the European Parliament. Finally, a Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm is applied to check the consistency of our findings.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Kenya reported its first case on March 13, 2020 and by March 16, 2020 she instituted physical distancing strategies to reduce transmission and flatten the epidemic curve. An age-structured compartmental model was developed to assess the impact of the strategies on COVID-19 severity and burden. Contacts between different ages are incorporated via contact matrices. Simulation results show that 45% reduction in contacts for 60-days period resulted to 11.5–13% reduction of infections severity and deaths, while for the 190-days period yielded 18.8–22.7% reduction. The peak of infections in the 60-days mitigation was higher and happened about 2 months after the relaxation of mitigation as compared to that of the 190-days mitigation, which happened a month after mitigations were relaxed. Low numbers of cases in children under 15 years was attributed to high number of asymptomatic cases. High numbers of cases are reported in the 15–29 years and 30–59 years age bands. Two mitigation periods, considered in the study, resulted to reductions in severe and critical cases, attack rates, hospital and ICU bed demands, as well as deaths, with the 190-days period giving higher reductions.

AB  - Corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS CoV-2), a highly contagious single stranded RNA virus genetically related to SARS CoV. The lungs are the main organs affected leading to pneumonia and respiratory failure in severe cases that may need mechanical ventilation. Occasionally patient may present with gastro-intestinal, cardiac and neurologic symptoms with or without lung involvement. Pathologically, the lungs show either mild congestion and alveolar exudation or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with hyaline membrane or histopathology of acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia (AFOP) that parallels disease severity. Other organs like liver and kidneys may be involved secondarily. Currently the treatment is principally symptomatic and prevention by proper use of personal protective equipment and other measures is crucial to limit the spread. In the midst of pandemic there is paucity of literature on pathological features including pathogenesis, hence in this review we provide the current pathology centered understanding of COVID-19. Furthermore, the pathogenetic pathway is pivotal in the development of therapeutic targets.

AB  - We measure the benefit to society created by preventing COVID-19 deaths through a marginal increase in early social distancing. We exploit county-level rainfall on the last weekend before statewide lockdown in the early phase of the pandemic. After controlling for historical rainfall, temperature, and state fixed-effects, current rainfall is a plausibly exogenous instrument for social distancing. A one percent decrease in the population leaving home on the weekend before lockdown creates an average of 132 dollars of benefit per county resident within 2 weeks. The impacts of earlier distancing compound over time and mainly arise from lowering the risk of a major outbreak, yielding large but unevenly distributed social benefit.

Systematic searches were conducted in various databases and search engines such as Medline, Chinese national knowledge infrastructure, Cochrane library, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar from inception until 22 April 2020. Newcastle Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of included studies. We carried out a meta-analysis with random-effects model and reported pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).A total of 50 studies were included in the review. Only seven studies (14%) had low risk of bias. Pooled prevalence rate of psychological morbidities includes poor sleep quality (40%), stress (34%), psychological distress (34%), insomnia (30%), post-traumatic stress symptoms (27%), anxiety (26%), depression (26%). Pooled prevalence rate of psychological morbidities with respect to impact of event due to COVID-19 pandemic was 44% (95%CI-42% to 47%). The burden of these psychological morbidities was highest among the COVID-19 patients followed by healthcare workers and general population.

AB  - The global scope of pollution from plastic waste is a well-known phenomenon associated with trade, mass consumption, and disposal of plastic products (e.g., personal protective equipment (PPE), viral test kits, and vacuum-packaged food). Recently, the scale of the problem has been exacerbated by increases in indoor livelihood activities during lockdowns imposed in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The present study describes the effects of increased plastic waste on environmental footprint and human health. Further, the technological/regulatory options and life cycle assessment (LCA) approach for sustainable plastic waste management are critically dealt in terms of their implications on energy resilience and circular economy. The abrupt increase in health-care waste during pandemic has been worsening environmental quality to undermine the sustainability in general. In addition, weathered plastic particles from PPE along with microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) can all adsorb chemical and microbial contaminants to pose a risk to ecosystems, biota, occupational safety, and human health. PPE-derived plastic pollution during the pandemic also jeopardizes sustainable development goals, energy resilience, and climate control measures. However, it is revealed that the pandemic can be regarded as an opportunity for explicit LCA to better address the problems associated with environmental footprints of plastic waste and to focus on sustainable management technologies such as circular bio-economies, biorefineries, and thermal gasification. Future researches in the energy-efficient clean technologies and circular bio-economies (or biorefineries) in concert with a “nexus” framework are expected to help reduce plastic waste into desirable directions.

AB  - Magnesium as an enzymatic activator is essential for various physiological functions such as cell cycle, metabolic regulation, muscle contraction, and vasomotor tone. A growing body of evidence supports that magnesium supplementation (mainly magnesium sulfate and magnesium oxide) prevents or treats various types of disorders or diseases related to respiratory system, reproductive system, nervous system, digestive system, and cardiovascular system as well as kidney injury, diabetes and cancer. The ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) characterized by respiratory tract symptoms with different degrees of important organ and tissue damages has attracted global attention. Particularly, effective drugs are still lacking in the COVID-19 therapy. In this review, we find and summarize the effectiveness of magnesium supplementation on the disorders or diseases, and provide a reference to the possibility of magnesium supplementation for supportive treatment in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Background and aims
Balanced nutrition which can help in maintaining immunity is essential for prevention and management of viral infections. While data regarding nutrition in coronavirus infection (COVID-19) are not available, in this review, we aimed to evaluate evidence from previous clinical trials that studied nutrition-based interventions for viral diseases (with special emphasis on respiratory infections), and summarise our observations.
Methods
A systematic search strategy was employed using keywords to search the literature in 3 key medical databases: PubMed®, Web of Science® and SciVerse Scopus®. Studies were considered eligible if they were controlled trials in humans, measuring immunological parameters, on viral and respiratory infections. Clinical trials on vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals and probiotics were included.
Results
A total of 640 records were identified initially and 22 studies were included from other sources. After excluding duplicates and articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 43 studies were obtained (vitamins: 13; minerals: 8; nutraceuticals: 18 and probiotics: 4). Among vitamins, A and D showed a potential benefit, especially in deficient populations. Among trace elements, selenium and zinc have also shown favourable immune-modulatory effects in viral respiratory infections. Several nutraceuticals and probiotics may also have some role in enhancing immune functions. Micronutrients may be beneficial in nutritionally depleted elderly population.
Conclusions
We summaries possible benefits of some vitamins, trace elements, nutraceuticals and probiotics in viral infections. Nutrition principles based on these data could be useful in possible prevention and management of COVID-19

AB  - Background
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has introduced a major disruption to the delivery of routine health care across the world. This provides challenges for the use of secondary prevention measures in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this Position Statement is to review the implications for effective delivery of secondary prevention strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Challenges
The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced limitations for many patients to access standard health services such as visits to health care professionals, medications, imaging and blood tests as well as attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. In addition, the pandemic is having an impact on lifestyle habits and mental health. Taken together, this has the potential to adversely impact the ability of practitioners and patients to adhere to treatment guidelines for the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events.
Recommendations
Every effort should be made to deliver safe, ongoing access to health care professionals and the use of evidenced based therapies in individuals with CVD. An increase in use of a range of electronic health platforms has the potential to transform secondary prevention. Integrating research programs that evaluate the utility of these approaches may provide important insights into how to develop more optimal approaches to secondary prevention beyond the pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic was a remarkable, unprecedented event which altered the lives of billions of citizens globally resulting in what became commonly referred to as the new-normal in terms of societal norms and the way we live and work. Aside from the extraordinary impact on society and business as a whole, the pandemic generated a set of unique cyber-crime related circumstances which also affected society and business. The increased anxiety caused by the pandemic heightened the likelihood of cyber-attacks succeeding corresponding with an increase in the number and range of cyber-attacks. This paper analyses the COVID-19 pandemic from a cyber-crime perspective and highlights the range of cyber-attacks experienced globally during the pandemic. Cyber-attacks are analysed and considered within the context of key global events to reveal the modus-operandi of cyber-attack campaigns. The analysis shows how following what appeared to be large gaps between the initial outbreak of the pandemic in China and the first COVID-19 related cyber-attack, attacks steadily became much more prevalent to the point that on some days, three or four unique cyber-attacks were being reported. The analysis proceeds to utilise the UK as a case study to demonstrate how cyber-criminals leveraged salient events and governmental announcements to carefully craft and execute cyber-crime campaigns.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant was first detected in France mid-November 2021 in wastewater treatment plants while cases started to increase at the beginning of December. The maximum incidence occurred in mid-January 2022. The Omicron wave spread rapidly throughout France in general population with lower case-fatality rate compared with previous waves. Little is known about infection with Omicron variant in heart transplant (HT) recipients. In this study, we examined incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in the general population and among 1,263 HT recipients during the period from June, 2021 to February, 2022, described characteristics of HT recipients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during Omicron (December 1st, 2021-February 7, 2022) and Delta (June 1st- November 30, 2021) periods, and compared hospital course of HT recipients with Omicron and Delta variant infection. Our findings contrast with the reported lower severity for Omicron variant infection compared with Delta variant infection in immunocompetent individuals.

AB  - Background
Italy was the first Western country to experience a major coronavirus outbreak and consequently faced large-scale health and socio-economic challenges. The Italian government enforced a wide set of homogeneous interventions nationally, despite the differing incidences of the virus throughout the country.
Objective
The paper aims to analyse the policies implemented by the government and their impact on health and non-health outcomes considering both scaling-up and scaling-down interventions.
Methods
To categorise the policy interventions, we rely on the comparative and conceptual framework developed by Moy et al. (2020). We investigate the impact of policies on the daily reported number of deaths, case fatality rate, confirmation rate, intensive care unit saturation, and financial and job market indicators across the three major geographical areas of Italy (North, Centre, and South). Qualitative and quantitative data are gathered from mixed sources: Italian national and regional institutions, National Health Research and international organisations. Our analysis contributes to the literature on the COVID-19 pandemic by comparing policy interventions and their outcomes.
Results
Our findings suggest that the strictness and timing of containment and prevention measures played a prominent role in tackling the pandemic, both from a health and economic perspective. Technological interventions played a marginal role due to the inadequacy of protocols and the delay of their implementation.
Conclusions
Future government interventions should be informed by evidence-based decision making to balance, the benefits arising from the timing and stringency of the interventions against the adverse social and economic cost, both in the short and long term.

AB  - We review the microbiological aspects of COVID-19 infection and present the microbiological studies that should be performed in forensic cases. We describe the taxonomic characteristics of the virus, its relationship with the coronaviridae family and its genetic structure. We briefly present the clinical and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 infection, as well as the co-infections that could be associated with this virus. In the laboratory, PCR is a first-choice technique in the acute phase of the infection, together with antigen and serological studies. Finally, we describe the main objectives of microbiological studies in the deceased in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the main post-mortem microbiological analysis to be carried out in the medico-legal context. The microbiological analysis should aim to detect both SARS-CoV-2 and coinfections, which may also contribute to the cause of death.

AB  - Background
The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) represents an ongoing major global health crisis with a potentially unprecedented death toll and socio-economic impact in the modern era. Measures taken to reduce the rate of transmission are too unprecedented, but are deemed necessary. The extensive strain on public health services has meant that individual agency is increasingly called for. To support this, there is a need to review policy and procedure governing the food and commerce industries in particular. Additionally, it is necessary to convey a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of relevant diet and lifestyle factors to both healthcare practitioners and the general public.
Scope and approach
To our knowledge, a review of possible additional measures for healthcare proffesionals, which includes the possible nutritional management COVID-19 pandemic does not yet exist. Key Findings and Conclusions: This review identifies i) changing trends in consumer awareness and purchasing patterns in response to COVID-19, and their potential future implications for the food and food-commerce industry ii) problematic elements of policy relevant to the outbreak of COVID-19, including the handling of wild-life and food-commerce, ii) newly emergent technologies in food science which represent viable and cost-effective means to reduce the risk of transmission of coronavirus, such as anti-microbial packaging, iii) important nutritional considerations with regard to coronavirus disease prevention and management, including nutrition in early infancy, and the role of select micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), phytochemicals and probiotics in conferring protection against both viral infection and pathogenicity.

AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic brought about by the SARS-CoV-2, a novel β coronavirus is creating intense health havoc globally. Researchers suspect the situation to stay for long in the community, considering this virus’s pathogenesis, high rate transmission and tendency to provoke uncontrolled immune response activation. Immune mechanisms are highly individualistic. We put forward a hypothetical model of prakruti (Ayurvedic body phenotyping character) based personalized prophylactic-therapeutic strategies aiming at a better immunomodulation and quicker resolution of host immune mechanisms. We propose this model in symptomatic, mild to moderate, COVID-19 diagnosed cases and in cases quarantined for high to low risk primary contact with a positive case. We also suggest a community level personalized Ayurvedic prophylactic-therapeutic strategy based on the DOTS model. Person-centered body purificatory measures (panchakarma procedures) like therapeutic purgation (virechana) and medicated enema (basti) are suggested in this hypothetical protocol with justification on evidence-based links between immune responses and prakruti along with specific jwara (fevers of varied origin as per Ayurvedic sciences) and COVID-19 symptomatology. The paper also appraises the importance of pitta dosha/ama dosha in the manifestation of inflammation driven destructive phase of immune responses along with its stage-wise intervention. This hypothetical model intends to open up discussions on significance of prakruti assessment as a predictive marker to screen people who are at risk of succumbing into deteriorating states if infected with COVID-19. It also intends to discuss the predictive personalized medicine measures based on prakruti in yielding individual host immune homeostasis which may positively reduce the chances of untoward events of an aggravated immune responsiveness and subsequent inflammation driven tissue destruction – the candidate causes for COVID-19 related casualties. Testing this model may give insight towards emphasizing personalized host immune coping mechanisms that may prove crucial in any infectious outbreaks in near future too.

AB  - In December 2019, a new variant of SARS-CoV emerged, the so-called acute severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus causes the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and has been plaguing the world owing to its unprecedented spread efficiency, which has resulted in a huge death toll. In this sense, the repositioning of approved drugs is the fastest way to an effective response to a pandemic outbreak of this scale. Considering these facts, in this review we provide a comprehensive and critical discussion on the chemical aspects surrounding the drugs currently being studied as candidates for COVID-19 therapy. We intend to provide the general chemical community with an overview on the synthetic/biosynthetic pathways related to such molecules, as well as their mechanisms of action against the evaluated viruses and some insights on the pharmacological interactions involved in each case. Overall, the review aims to present the chemical aspects of the main bioactive molecules being considered to be repositioned for effective treatment of COVID-19 in all phases, from the mildest to the most severe.

AB  - Purpose
To compare the effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation strategies in two homeless shelters in Massachusetts during the pandemic.
Methods
We conducted a prospective cohort study that followed guests in two Massachusetts homeless shelters between March 30 and May 13, 2020, which adopted different depopulation strategies. One set up temporary tents in its parking lot, while the other decompressed its guests to a gym and a hotel. The outcome was assessed by comparing the odds ratios of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays.
Results
Guests residing at the shelter that used temporary tents had 6.21 times (95% CI = 1.86, 20.77) higher odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at follow-up after adjusting for loss to follow up, age, gender, and race. The daily COVID-19 symptoms checklist performed poorly in detecting positive infection.
Conclusions
The study highlights the importance of depopulating shelter guests with stable and adequate indoor space to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Daily temperature and symptom checks should be combined with routine testing. With the rising homelessness due to mass unemployment and eviction crisis, our study supports further governmental assistance in decompressing homeless shelters during this pandemic.

AB  - This work demonstrates the presence of immune regulatory cells in the cervical lymph nodes draining Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccinated site on the dorsum of the ear in guinea pigs. It is shown that whole cervical lymph node cells did not proliferate in vitro in the presence of soluble mycobacterial antigens (PPD or leprosin) despite being responsive to whole mycobacteria. Besides, T cells from these lymph nodes separated as a non-adherent fraction on a nylon wool column, proliferated to PPD in the presence of autologous antigen presenting cells. Interestingly, addition of as low as 20% nylon wool adherent cells to these, sharply decreased the proliferation by 83%. Looking into what cells in the adherent fraction suppressed the proliferation, it was found that neither the T cell nor the macrophage enriched cell fractions of this population individually showed suppressive effect, indicating that their co-presence was necessary for the suppression. Since BCG induced granulomas resolve much faster than granulomas induced by other mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae the present experimental findings add to the existing evidence that intradermal BCG vaccination influences subsequent immune responses in the host and may further stress upon its beneficial role seen in Covid-19 patients.

AB  - Summary
Background
COVID-19 has disproportionately affected minority ethnic populations in the UK. Our aim was to quantify ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcomes during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in England.
Methods
We conducted an observational cohort study of adults (aged ≥18 years) registered with primary care practices in England for whom electronic health records were available through the OpenSAFELY platform, and who had at least 1 year of continuous registration at the start of each study period (Feb 1 to Aug 3, 2020 [wave 1], and Sept 1 to Dec 31, 2020 [wave 2]). Individual-level primary care data were linked to data from other sources on the outcomes of interest: SARS-CoV-2 testing and positive test results and COVID-19-related hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and death. The exposure was self-reported ethnicity as captured on the primary care record, grouped into five high-level census categories (White, South Asian, Black, other, and mixed) and 16 subcategories across these five categories, as well as an unknown ethnicity category. We used multivariable Cox regression to examine ethnic differences in the outcomes of interest. Models were adjusted for age, sex, deprivation, clinical factors and comorbidities, and household size, with stratification by geographical region.
Findings
Of 17 288 532 adults included in the study (excluding care home residents), 10 877 978 (62·9%) were White, 1 025 319 (5·9%) were South Asian, 340 912 (2·0%) were Black, 170 484 (1·0%) were of mixed ethnicity, 320 788 (1·9%) were of other ethnicity, and 4 553 051 (26·3%) were of unknown ethnicity. In wave 1, the likelihood of being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection was slightly higher in the South Asian group (adjusted hazard ratio 1·08 [95% CI 1·07–1·09]), Black group (1·08 [1·06–1·09]), and mixed ethnicity group (1·04 [1·02–1·05]) and was decreased in the other ethnicity group (0·77 [0·76–0·78]) relative to the White group. The risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher in the South Asian group (1·99 [1·94–2·04]), Black group (1·69 [1·62–1·77]), mixed ethnicity group (1·49 [1·39–1·59]), and other ethnicity group (1·20 [1·14–1·28]). Compared with the White group, the four remaining high-level ethnic groups had an increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation (South Asian group 1·48 [1·41–1·55], Black group 1·78 [1·67–1·90], mixed ethnicity group 1·63 [1·45–1·83], other ethnicity group 1·54 [1·41–1·69]), COVID-19-related ICU admission (2·18 [1·92–2·48], 3·12 [2·65–3·67], 2·96 [2·26–3·87], 3·18 [2·58–3·93]), and death (1·26 [1·15–1·37], 1·51 [1·31–1·71], 1·41 [1·11–1·81], 1·22 [1·00–1·48]). In wave 2, the risks of hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death relative to the White group were increased in the South Asian group but attenuated for the Black group compared with these risks in wave 1. Disaggregation into 16 ethnicity groups showed important heterogeneity within the five broader categories.
Interpretation
Some minority ethnic populations in England have excess risks of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and of adverse COVID-19 outcomes compared with the White population, even after accounting for differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and household characteristics. Causes are likely to be multifactorial, and delineating the exact mechanisms is crucial. Tackling ethnic inequalities will require action across many fronts, including reducing structural inequalities, addressing barriers to equitable care, and improving uptake of testing and vaccination.

AB  - We use county level data from the United States to document the role of social capital the evolution of COVID-19 between January 2020 and January 2021. We find that social capital differentials in COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations depend on the dimension of social capital and the timeframe considered. Communities with higher levels of relational and cognitive social capital were especially successful in lowering COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations than communities with lower social capital between late March and early April. A difference of one standard deviation in relational social capital corresponded to a reduction of 30% in the number of COVID-19 deaths recorded. After April 2020, differentials in COVID-19 deaths related to relational social capital persisted although they became progressively less pronounced. By contrast, the period of March–April 2020, our estimates suggest that there was no statistically significant difference in the number of deaths recorded in areas with different levels of cognitive social capital. In fact, from late June-early July onwards the number of new deaths recorded as being due to COVID-19 was higher in communities with higher levels of cognitive social capital. The overall number of deaths recorded between January 2020 and January 2021 was lower in communities with higher levels of relational social capital. Our findings suggest that the association between social capital and public health outcomes can vary greatly over time and across indicators of social capital.

AB  - In this review we bring together evidence that (i) RNA viruses are a cause of chromosomal instability and micronuclei (MN), (ii) those individuals with high levels of lymphocyte MN have a weakened immune response and are more susceptible to RNA virus infection and (iii) both RNA virus infection and MN formation can induce inflammatory cytokine production. Based on these observations we propose a hypothesis that those who harbor elevated frequencies of MN within their cells are more prone to RNA virus infection and are more likely, through combined effects of leakage of self-DNA from MN and RNA from viruses, to escalate pro-inflammatory cytokine production via the cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and the Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) mechanisms to an extent that is unresolvable and therefore confers high risk of causing tissue damage by an excessive and overtly toxic immune response. The corollaries from this hypothesis are (i) those with abnormally high MN frequency are more prone to infection by RNA viruses; (ii) the extent of cytokine production and pro-inflammatory response to infection by RNA viruses is enhanced and possibly exceeds threshold levels that may be unresolvable in those with elevated MN levels in affected organs; (iii) reduction of MN frequency by improving nutrition and life-style factors increases resistance to RNA virus infection and moderates inflammatory cytokine production to a level that is immunologically efficacious and survivable.

AB  - The high rate of spreading of COVID-19 is attributed to airborne particles exhaled by infected but often asymptomatic individuals. In this review, the role of aerosols in SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus transmission is discussed from the biophysical perspective. The essential properties of the coronavirus virus transported inside aerosol droplets, their successive inhalation, and size-dependent deposition in the respiratory system are highlighted. The importance of face covers (respirators and masks) in the reduction of aerosol spreading is analyzed. Finally, the discussion of the physicochemical phenomena of the coronavirus entering the surface of lung liquids (bronchial mucus and pulmonary surfactant) is presented with a focus on a possible role of interfacial phenomena in pulmonary alveoli. Information given in this review should be important in understanding the essential biophysical conditions of COVID-19 infection via aerosol route as a prerequisite for effective strategies of respiratory tract protection, and possibly, indications for future treatments of the disease.

AB  - The fight against COVID-19 since January 2020 has become the top priority of more than 200 countries. In order to offer solutions to eradicate this global pandemic, the scientific community has published hundreds of articles covering a wide range of areas of knowledge. With the aim of synthesizing these publications, academics are resorting to bibliometric analyses from the perspectives of the disciplines such as biology, medicine, socioeconomics and tourism. Yet no bibliometric analysis has explored the diffuse and little-known growth of COVID-19 scientific publications in the field of environmental studies. The current study is the first of this type to fill this research gap. It has resorted to SciMAT software to evaluate the main topics, authors and journals of publications on the subject of COVID-19 combined with environmental studies spanning the period between 1 December 2019 and 6 September 2020. The search yielded a collection of 440 articles published in scientific journals indexed on by Web of Science and Scopus databases. These publications can be broken down into six main themes: (i) a sharp reduction in air pollution and an improvement of the level of water pollution; (ii) the relationship of wind speed (positive), ultraviolet radiation (positive) and humidity (negative) with the rate of infections; (iii) the effect of the pandemic on the food supply chain and waste habits; (iv) wastewater monitoring offers a great potential as an early warning sign of COVID-19 transmission; (v) artificial intelligence and smart devices can be of great use in monitoring citizen mobilization; and (vi) the lessons gleaned from the pandemic that help define actions to mitigate climate change. The results of the current study therefore offer an agenda for future research and constitute a starting point for academics in the field of environmental studies to evaluate the effects of COVID-19.

AB  - Objectives
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic that emerged in December 2019 has rapidly evolved in recent months to become a worldwide and ongoing pandemic. Shortage of medical masks remains an unresolved problem. This study aims to investigate the filtration efficiency (FE) of home-made masks that could be used as alternatives for community mitigation of COVID-19.
Study design
Experimental observational analytic study.
Methods
The FE of home-made masks and medical masks (as the control) were tested under laminar flow within a scaled air duct system using nebulised NaCl aerosols sized 6–220 nm. The size-resolved NaCl aerosol count was measured using a scanning mobility particle-sizer spectrometer. Home-made masks with an external plastic face shield also underwent a splash test. In addition, the fibre structures of medical masks were studied under an electron microscope after treatment with either 75% alcohol or soap and water at 60 °C.
Results
The FE of the home-made masks at 6–200 nm were non-inferior to that of medical masks (84.54% vs 86.94%, P = 0.102). Both types of masks achieved an FE of 90% at 6–89 nm. A significantly higher FE was achieved when one piece of tissue paper was added adjacent to the inner surface of the medical mask than medical mask alone (6–200 nm: 91.64% vs 86.94%, P < 0.0001; 6–89 nm: 94.27% vs 90.54%, P < 0.0001; 90–200 nm: 82.69% vs 73.81%, P < 0.0001). The plastic face shield prevented the home-made mask from fluid splash. The fibre structures of the external surface of medical masks were damaged after treatment with either 75% alcohol or soap and water at 60 °C.
Conclusions
The home-made masks in this study, which were made of one piece of tissue paper and two pieces of kitchen towels, layered from face to external, had an FE at 6–200 nm non-inferior to that of medical mask materials, which had a certified FE of ≥95% at 3 μm. In the current COVID-19 pandemic with the shortage of medical masks, these home-made masks combined with an external plastic shield could be used as an alternative to medical masks for community mitigation. In addition, one piece of tissue paper could be placed adjacent to the inner surface of a medical mask to prolong effective lifespan of the medical mask. These demand reduction strategies could be used to reserve medical masks for use in healthcare and certain high-risk community settings, such as symptomatic persons, caregivers and attendees to healthcare institutions.

AB  - Purpose
To critically evaluate the potential impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on global ophthalmology and VISION 2020.
Design
Perspective supplemented with epidemiologic insights from available online databases.
Methods
We extracted data from the Global Vision Database (2017) and Global Burden of Disease Study (2017) to highlight temporal trends in global blindness since 1990, and provide a narrative overview of how COVID-19 may derail progress toward the goals of VISION 2020.
Results
Over 2 decades of VISION 2020 advocacy and program implementation have culminated in a universal reduction of combined age-standardized prevalence of moderate-to-severe vision impairment (MSVI) across all world regions since 1990. Between 1990 and 2017, low-income countries observed large reductions in the age-standardized prevalence per 100,000 persons of vitamin A deficiency (25,155 to 19,187), undercorrected refractive disorders (2,286 to 2,040), cataract (1,846 to 1,690), onchocerciasis (5,577 to 2,871), trachoma (506 to 159), and leprosy (36 to 26). Despite these reductions, crude projections suggest that more than 700 million persons will experience MSVI or blindness by 2050, principally owing to our growing and ageing global population.
Conclusions
Despite the many resounding successes of VISION 2020, the burden of global blindness and vision impairment is set to reach historic levels in the coming years. The impact of COVID-19, while yet to be fully determined, now threatens the hard-fought gains of global ophthalmology. The postpandemic years will require renewed effort and focus on vision advocacy and expanding eye care services worldwide.

The covalent fusion of immunostimulatory adjuvants to immunogenic antigens is a promising strategy for the development of effective synthetic vaccines for infectious diseases. Herein, we describe the conjugation of a mycobacterial peptide antigen from the 6 kDa early secretory antigenic target (ESAT6) to a suitably functionalised trehalose dibehenate (TDB), a potent glycolipid adjuvant targeting macrophage inducible C-type lectin (Mincle).

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to twin public health and economic crises around the world. Not only has it cost hundreds of thousands of lives but also severely impacted livelihoods and placed enormous strain on community healthcare and welfare services. In this review, we explore the events associated with SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and host immunopathological reactivity due to the clinical manifestations of this coronavirus infection. We discuss that the metallopeptidase enzyme ADAM17, also known as tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme, TACE, is responsible for shedding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and membrane-bound interleukin (IL)-6 receptor. This leads to elevated pro-inflammatory responses that result in cytokine storm syndrome. We argue that cytokine balance may be restored by recovering an IL-6 trans-signaling neutralizing buffer system through the mediation of recombinant soluble glycoprotein 130 and recombinant ADAM17/TACE prodomain inhibitor. This cytokine restoration, possibly combined with inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry as well as replication and coagulopathy, could be introduced as a novel approach to treat patients with severe COVID-19. In cases of co-morbidity, therapies related to the management of associated disease conditions could ameliorate those clinical manifestations.

AB  - Using daily data from January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021, this research explores COVID-19 shocks on the stock market of 15 representative oil exploration and production enterprises from 7 countries. We measure the COVID-19 epidemic from two levels, government response stringency index and number of confirmed cases, and employ stock prices and stock market returns to reflect the stock market. Our research results confirm that both the government response stringency index and the number of confirmed cases have a significantly negative influence on stock prices. We further find that the negative reaction of the stock market to the government response stringency index is greater than that from confirmed cases. Finally, we conclude that the government response stringency index have a significantly positive effect on stock market returns of oil exploration and production enterprises. Similar findings arise from analyzing specific enterprises. Overall, our conclusions provide some useful information for the decision-making of oil exploration and production enterprises’ investors and policy makers.

AB  - This paper analyzes the optimal management of a pandemic (stay-at-home and vaccination policies) in a dynamic model. The optimal lockdown policies respond to the spread of the virus with significant restrictions to employment, followed by partial loosening before the peak of the epidemic. Upon the availability of a vaccine, the optimal vaccination policy has an almost bang-bang property, despite the loss of immunity of the vaccinated: vaccinate at the highest possible rate, and then rapidly converge to the steady state. The model illustrates interesting trade-offs as it implies that lower hospital capacity requires flattening the infection curve and hence a more stringent lockdown, but lower vaccination possibilities (both the likelihood of a vaccine and the vaccination rate) push the optimal lockdown policy in the opposite direction, even before the arrival of vaccine. The model implies that the “dollar value of a vaccine decreases rapidly as time passes with the reinfection rate being an important determinant of the monetary value”. The value that society assigns to averting deaths is a major driver of the optimal policy. The sensitivity analysis shows that even for reasonable bounds of the economic and epidemiological parameters, the timing and the magnitude of the optimal policy varies substantially.

AB  - COVID-19 has now spread to all the continents of the world with the possible exception of Antarctica. However, Africa appears different when compared with all the other continents. The absence of exponential growth and the low mortality rates contrary to that experienced in other continents, and contrary to the projections for Africa by various agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO) has been a puzzle to many. Although Africa is the second most populous continent with an estimated 17.2% of the world's population, the continent accounts for only 5% of the total cases and 3% of the mortality. Mortality for the whole of Africa remains at a reported 19,726 as at August 01, 2020. The onset of the pandemic was later, the rate of rise has been slower and the severity of illness and case fatality rates have been lower in comparison to other continents. In addition, contrary to what had been documented in other continents, the occurrence of the renal complications in these patients also appeared to be much lower. This report documents the striking differences between the continents and within the continent of Africa itself and then attempts to explain the reasons for these differences. It is hoped that information presented in this review will help policymakers in the fight to contain the pandemic, particularly within Africa with its resource-constrained health care systems.

AB  - The global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is affecting every part of human lives, including the physical world. The measures taken to control the spread of the virus and the slowdown of economic activities have significant effects on the environment. Therefore, this study intends to explore the positive and negative environmental impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, by reviewing the available scientific literatures. This study indicates that, the pandemic situation significantly improves air quality in different cities across the world, reduces GHGs emission, lessens water pollution and noise, and reduces the pressure on the tourist destinations, which may assist with the restoration of the ecological system. In addition, there are also some negative consequences of COVID-19, such as increase of medical waste, haphazard use and disposal of disinfectants, mask, and gloves; and burden of untreated wastes continuously endangering the environment. It seems that, economic activities will return soon after the pandemic, and the situation might change. Hence, this study also outlines possible ways to achieve long-term environmental benefits. It is expected that the proper implementation of the proposed strategies might be helpful for the global environmental sustainability.

AB  - Early diagnosis is important to control COVID-19 outbreaks. This study aimed to assess how individual and area socioeconomic position and geographical accessibility to healthcare services were associated with the time to diagnosis among symptomatic COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong. Multivariable generalized linear regression was used to estimate the associations while adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and case classification. This study found living in public rental housing and living in an area with low education were associated with longer time to diagnosis in the first wave of infections. Specifically, the risk of delayed diagnosis for public rental housing residents was mitigated by the higher density of public clinics/hospitals but was slightly increased by the higher density of private medical practitioners nearby. No such relations were found in the second wave of infections when the surveillance measures were enhanced. Given the grave impact of pandemics around the world, our findings call on taking inequalities into account when public health policies are being devised.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged authorities at different levels of government administration around the globe. When faced with diseases of this severity, it is useful for the authorities to have prediction tools to estimate in advance the impact on the health system as well as the human, material, and economic resources that will be necessary. In this paper, we construct an extended Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Recovered model that incorporates the social structure of Mar del Plata, the 4°most inhabited city in Argentina and head of the Municipality of General Pueyrredón. Moreover, we consider detailed partitions of infected individuals according to the illness severity, as well as data of local health resources, to bring predictions closer to the local reality. Tuning the corresponding epidemic parameters for COVID-19, we study an alternating quarantine strategy: a part of the population can circulate without restrictions at any time, while the rest is equally divided into two groups and goes on successive periods of normal activity and lockdown, each one with a duration of τ days. We also implement a random testing strategy with a threshold over the population. We found that τ=7 is a good choice for the quarantine strategy since it reduces the infected population and, conveniently, it suits a weekly schedule. Focusing on the health system, projecting from the situation as of September 30, we foresee a difficulty to avoid saturation of the available ICU, given the extremely low levels of mobility that would be required. In the worst case, our model estimates that four thousand deaths would occur, of which 30% could be avoided with proper medical attention. Nonetheless, we found that aggressive testing would allow an increase in the percentage of people that can circulate without restrictions, and the medical facilities to deal with the additional critical patients would be relatively low.

AB  - Background
COVLIAS 1.0: an automated lung segmentation was designed for COVID-19 diagnosis. It has issues related to storage space and speed. This study shows that COVLIAS 2.0 uses pruned AI (PAI) networks for improving both storage and speed, wiliest high performance on lung segmentation and lesion localization.
Method
ology: The proposed study uses multicenter ∼9,000 CT slices from two different nations, namely, CroMed from Croatia (80 patients, experimental data), and NovMed from Italy (72 patients, validation data). We hypothesize that by using pruning and evolutionary optimization algorithms, the size of the AI models can be reduced significantly, ensuring optimal performance. Eight different pruning techniques (i) differential evolution (DE), (ii) genetic algorithm (GA), (iii) particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), and (iv) whale optimization algorithm (WO) in two deep learning frameworks (i) Fully connected network (FCN) and (ii) SegNet were designed. COVLIAS 2.0 was validated using “Unseen NovMed” and benchmarked against MedSeg. Statistical tests for stability and reliability were also conducted.

AB  - Introduction
A novel coronavirus virus (2019-nCoV) emerged in China in December 2019 and achieved a high-risk category by the World Health Organization (WHO). The initial symptoms included fever, cough, dyspnea, and sore throat. The present review aims to evaluate the available evidence for the safety and efficacy of Unani herbal drugs and formulations in the prevention of Wabai Amraz (epidemic diseases) having resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
Sources of data for this paper are classical Unani textbooks, Unani pharmacopeia of India, Indian Medicinal Plants-An Illustrated Dictionary, and published articles in various reputed peer-reviewed journals. Collected information was then critically analyzed.
Results
Despite great efforts, no specific treatment has been discovered for coronavirus yet. The best choices, therefore, are prevention and management. The Unani system of medicine offers health protection during epidemics. Three important interventions practised during an outbreak are (i) purification of the environment by using certain herbal drugs as fumigants which include vinegar (acetic acid) alone or combined with Ferula foetida Regel; (ii) promotion of health and immune modulation by using the pharmacopoeial preparations Khamira-e-Khashkhash and Khamira-e-Marwareed.
Conclusion
Several single drugs, as well as compound formulations, have been recommended in Unani medicine for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. The pharmacopoeial preparation Tiryaq-e-Nazla has been used for respiratory catarrhal inflammations and influenza by Hakims of the medieval period. Scientific research on these drugs reveals the presence of many pharmacologically active substances possessing significant antiviral, antipyretic, anti-tussive, and immune-modulatory properties, which can give new insight into infection and epidemic management.

AB  - Summary
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has global impacts but is relatively understudied in developing countries. Mongolia, a lower-middle-income country, instituted strict control measures in early 2020 and avoided widespread transmission until vaccines became available in February, 2021. Mongolia achieved its 60% vaccination coverage goal by July 2021. We investigated the distribution and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Mongolia over 2020 and 2021.
Methods
We performed a longitudinal seroepidemiologic study aligned with WHO's Unity Studies protocols. We collected data from a panel of 5000 individuals in four rounds between October 2020 and December 2021. We selected participants through local health centres across Mongolia by age-stratified multi-stage cluster sampling. We tested serum for the presence of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain, and levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG and neutralising antibodies. We linked participant data with national mortality, COVID-19 case, and vaccination registries. We estimated population seroprevalence and vaccine uptake, as well as unvaccinated population prior-infection prevalence.
Findings
At the final round in late 2021, 82% (n = 4088) of participants completed follow-up. Estimated seroprevalence increased from 1.5% (95% CI: 1.2–2.0), to 82.3% (95% CI: 79.5–84.8) between late-2020 and late-2021. At the final round an estimated 62.4% (95% CI: 60.2–64.5) of the population were vaccinated, and of the unvaccinated population 64.5% (95% CI: 59.7–69.0) had been infected. Cumulative case ascertainment in the unvaccinated was 22.8% (95% CI: 19.1%–26.9%) and the overall infection-fatality ratio was 0.100% (95% CI: 0.088–0.124). Health workers had higher odds for being COVID-19 confirmed cases at all rounds. Males (1.72 (95% CI: 1.33–2.22)) and adults aged 20 and above (12.70 (95% CI: 8.14–20.26)) had higher odds for seroconverting by mid-2021. Among the seropositive, 87.1% (95% CI: 82.3%–90.8%) had SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies by late 2021.
Interpretation
Our study enabled tracking of SARS-CoV-2 serological markers in the Mongolian population over one year. We found low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in 2020 and early 2021, with seropositivity increasing over a 3-month interval in 2021 due to vaccine roll out and rapid infection of most of the unvaccinated population. Despite high seroprevalence in Mongolia amongst both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals by end-2021, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron immune escape variant caused a substantial epidemic.

AB  - Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)-based mRNA vaccines have shown great potential in the fight against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. However, it remains still a challenge to improve the delivery efficiency of LNPs and the long-term stability of their mediated mRNA vaccines. Herein, a novel ionizable lipid 2-hexyldecyl 6-(ethyl(3-((2-hexyldecyl)oxy)-2-hydroxypropyl)amino)hexanoate (HEAH) derived LNPs were developed for delivering the receptor binding domain (RBD) mRNAs. In vitro cell assays confirmed that the ionizable lipid HEAH with one ether bond and one ester bond derived LNPs possessed higher mRNA delivery efficiency compared with the approved ALC-0315 with two ester bonds used in the BNT162b2 vaccine. Notably, the HEAH-derived LNPs powder lyophilized did not significantly change for 30 days after storage at 37 °C indicating good thermostability. After two RBD mRNAs of Delta and Omicron variants were encapsulated into the HEAH-derived LNPs, a bivalent mRNA vaccine was obtained as a nanoparticle formulation. Importantly, the bivalent mRNA vaccine not only resisted Delta and Omicron and also generated protective antibodies against ancestral SARS-CoV-2. The HEAH-mediated bivalent vaccine induced stronger humoral and cellular immunity than those of the ALC-0315 group. Taken together, the ionizable lipid HEAH-derived LNPs show outstanding potential in improving the delivery efficiency of mRNA and the stability of mRNA vaccine.

AB  - Summary
Background
Although the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic progressed more slowly in Africa than the rest of the world, by December, 2020, the second wave appeared to be much more aggressive with many more cases. To date, the pandemic situation in all 55 African Union (AU) Member States has not been comprehensively reviewed. We aimed to evaluate reported COVID-19 epidemiology data to better understand the pandemic's progression in Africa.
Methods
We did a cross-sectional analysis between Feb 14 and Dec 31, 2020, using COVID-19 epidemiological, testing, and mitigation strategy data reported by AU Member States to assess trends and identify the response and mitigation efforts at the country, regional, and continent levels. We did descriptive analyses on the variables of interest including cumulative and weekly incidence rates, case fatality ratios (CFRs), tests per case ratios, growth rates, and public health and social measures in place.
Findings
As of Dec 31, 2020, African countries had reported 2 763 421 COVID-19 cases and 65 602 deaths, accounting for 3·4% of the 82 312 150 cases and 3·6% of the 1 798 994 deaths reported globally. Nine of the 55 countries accounted for more than 82·6% (2 283 613) of reported cases. 18 countries reported CFRs greater than the global CFR (2·2%). 17 countries reported test per case ratios less than the recommended ten to 30 tests per case ratio range. At the peak of the first wave in Africa in July, 2020, the mean daily number of new cases was 18 273. As of Dec 31, 2020, 40 (73%) countries had experienced or were experiencing their second wave of cases with the continent reporting a mean of 23 790 daily new cases for epidemiological week 53. 48 (96%) of 50 Member States had five or more stringent public health and social measures in place by April 15, 2020, but this number had decreased to 36 (72%) as of Dec 31, 2020, despite an increase in cases in the preceding month.
Interpretation
Our analysis showed that the African continent had a more severe second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic than the first, and highlights the importance of examining multiple epidemiological variables down to the regional and country levels over time. These country-specific and regional results informed the implementation of continent-wide initiatives and supported equitable distribution of supplies and technical assistance. Monitoring and analysis of these data over time are essential for continued situational awareness, especially as Member States attempt to balance controlling COVID-19 transmission with ensuring stable economies and livelihoods.

AB  - The coronavirus has come to the world and spread with great wide among the countries of the world and has resulted in numerous infections that exceeded 167,181,023 million patients and are close to 3.5 deaths by September 2021. It also brought with it panic and fear, halted many activities, and led to the decline of the global economy. It changed human behavior and forced people to change their lifestyles to avoid infection. One of the most sectors that must be taken into consideration through pandemic coronavirus (COVID-19) around the globe is the air conditioning systems. The HVAC systems depend on the air as a heat transfer medium. The air contains a group of pollutants, viruses, and bacteria, and it affects and destroys human life. The air filter plays a major role as an important component in the air conditioning systems. Thus, it requires more effort by researchers to improve its design to prevent the ultra-size of particles loaded with coronavirus (COVID-19). This paper provides insight into the design of existing combined air-conditioners on their suitability and their impact on the spread of the hybrid coronavirus epidemic and review efforts to obtain a highly efficient air filter to get rid of super-sized particles for protection against epidemic infection. In addition, important guideline recommendations have been made to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus and to obtain indoor air quality in air-conditioned places.

AB  - Although the efficacy and commercial success of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies have been tremendous, designing and discovering new drug candidates remains a labor-, time- and cost-intensive endeavor with high risks. The main challenges of vaccine development are inducing a strong immune response in broad populations and providing effective prevention against a group of highly variable pathogens. Meanwhile, antibody discovery faces several great obstacles, especially the blindness in antibody screening and the unpredictability of the developability and druggability of antibody drugs. These challenges are largely due to poorly understanding of germline antibodies and the antibody responses to pathogen invasions. Thanks to the recent developments in high-throughput sequencing and structural biology, we have gained insight into the germline immunoglobulin (Ig) genes and germline antibodies and then the germline antibody features associated with antigens and disease manifestation. In this review, we firstly outline the broad associations between germline antibodies and antigens. Moreover, we comprehensively review the recent applications of antigen-specific germline antibody features, physicochemical properties-associated germline antibody features, and disease manifestation-associated germline antibody features on vaccine development, antibody discovery, antibody optimization, and disease diagnosis. Lastly, we discuss the bottlenecks and perspectives of current and potential applications of germline antibody features in the biotechnology field.

AB  - The zoonotic virus now named SARS-CoV-2 first infected humans in China, and COVID-19 has rapidly become pandemic. To mitigate its impact on societies, health systems and economies, countries have adopted non-pharmacological preventive practices such as ‘spatial’ or ‘social’ distancing, the use of protective masks, and handwashing; these have been widely implemented. However, measures aimed at protecting physical health and healthcare systems have side-effects that might have a big impact on individuals’ wellbeing. As the pandemic reaches low- and middle-income countries, weaker health systems, limited resources and the lower socioeconomic status of their populations make halting the pandemic more challenging. In this article, we explore the impact of COVID-19 and its prevention measures on the wellbeing of vulnerable populations. Special attention must be given to homeless, indigenous, migrant and imprisoned populations, as well as people living with disabilities and the elderly. More than just resolute governmental action will be required to overcome the pandemic. Links between science and political actions have to be strengthened. Fighting COVID-19 is a collective endeavour and community action, on a global scale, is of paramount importance.

AB  - This paper compares health policy responses to COVID-19 in Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom and United States of America (US) from January to November 2020, with the aim of facilitating cross-country learning. Evidence is taken from the COVID-19 Health System Response Monitor, a joint initiative of the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, the WHO Regional Office for Europe, and the European Commission, which has documented country responses to COVID-19 using a structured template completed by country experts. We show all countries faced common challenges during the pandemic, including difficulties in scaling-up testing capacity, implementing timely and appropriate containment measures amid much uncertainty and overcoming shortages of health and social care workers, personal protective equipment and other medical technologies. Country responses to address these issues were similar in many ways, but dissimilar in others, reflecting differences in health system organization and financing, political leadership and governance structures. In the US, lack of universal health coverage have created barriers to accessing care, while political pushback against scientific leadership has likely undermined the crisis response. Our findings highlight the importance of consistent messaging and alignment between health experts and political leadership to increase the level of compliance with public health measures, alongside the need to invest in health infrastructure and training and retaining an adequate domestic health workforce. Building on innovations in care delivery seen during the pandemic, including increased use of digital technology, can also help inform development of more resilient health systems longer-term.

AB  - Abstract
oxidative stress is caused by an abundant generation of reactive oxygen species, associated to a diminished capacity of the endogenous systems of the organism to counteract them. Activation of pro-oxidative pathways and boosting of inflammatory cytokines are always encountered in viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. So, the importance of counteracting cytokine storm in COVID-19 pathology is highly important, to hamper the immunogenic damage of the endothelium and alveolar membranes. Antioxidants prevent oxidative processes, by impeding radical species generation. It has been proved that vitamin intake lowers oxidative stress markers, alleviates cytokine storm and has a potential role in reducing disease severity, by lowering pro-inflammatory cytokines, hampering hyperinflammation and organ failure. For the approached compounds, direct antiviral roles are also discussed in this review, as these activities encompass secretion of antiviral peptides, modulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor expression and interaction with spike protein, inactivation of furin protease, or inhibition of pathogen replication by nucleic acid impairment induction. Vitamin administration results in beneficial effects. Nevertheless, timing, dosage and mutual influences of these micronutrients should be carefullly regarded.

AB  - In spite of the widespread implementation of preventive strategies, the prevalence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) remains high. The prevalence of multidrug resistant organisms is high in HAIs. In 2019, the World Health Organization retained antimicrobial resistance as one of the ten issues for global health. The development of vaccines may contribute to the fight against antimicrobial resistance to reduce the burden of HAIs. Staphylococcus aureus, Gram negative bacteria and Clostridium difficile are the most frequent pathogens reported in HAIs. Consequently, the development of vaccines against these pathogens is crucial. At this stage, the goal of obtaining effective vaccines against S.aureus and Gram negative bacteria has not yet been achieved. However, we can expect in the near future availability of a vaccine against C. difficile. In addition, identifying populations who may benefit from these vaccines is complex, as at-risk patients are not great responders to vaccines, or as vaccination may occur too late, when they are already confronted to the risk. Vaccinating healthcare workers (HCWs) against these pathogens may have an impact only if HCWs play a role in the transmission and in the pathogens acquisition in patients, if the vaccine is effective to reduce pathogens carriage and if vaccine coverage is sufficient to protect patients. Acceptance of these potential vaccines should be evaluated and addressed in patients and in HCWs.

AB  - Summary
Immunocompromised individuals and particularly those with hematologic malignancies are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity and mortality due to immunologic deficits that limit prevention, treatment, and clearance of the virus. Understanding the natural history of viral infections in people with impaired immunity due to underlying conditions, immunosuppressive therapy, or a combination thereof has emerged as a critical area of investigation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies focused on these individuals have provided key insights into aspects of innate and adaptive immunity underlying both the antiviral immune response and excess inflammation in the setting of COVID-19. This review presents what is known about distinct states of immunologic vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 and how this information can be harnessed to improve prevention and treatment strategies for immunologically high-risk populations.

AB  - Summary
Background
Real-time prediction is key to prevention and control of infections associated with health-care settings. Contacts enable spread of many infections, yet most risk prediction frameworks fail to account for their dynamics. We developed, tested, and internationally validated a real-time machine-learning framework, incorporating dynamic patient-contact networks to predict hospital-onset COVID-19 infections (HOCIs) at the individual level.
Methods
We report an international retrospective cohort study of our framework, which extracted patient-contact networks from routine hospital data and combined network-derived variables with clinical and contextual information to predict individual infection risk. We trained and tested the framework on HOCIs using the data from 51 157 hospital inpatients admitted to a UK National Health Service hospital group (Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust) between April 1, 2020, and April 1, 2021, intersecting the first two COVID-19 surges. We validated the framework using data from a Swiss hospital group (Department of Rehabilitation, Geneva University Hospitals) during a COVID-19 surge (from March 1 to May 31, 2020; 40 057 inpatients) and from the same UK group after COVID-19 surges (from April 2 to Aug 13, 2021; 43 375 inpatients). All inpatients with a bed allocation during the study periods were included in the computation of network-derived and contextual variables. In predicting patient-level HOCI risk, only inpatients spending 3 or more days in hospital during the study period were examined for HOCI acquisition risk.
Findings
The framework was highly predictive across test data with all variable types (area under the curve [AUC]-receiver operating characteristic curve [ROC] 0·89 [95% CI 0·88–0·90]) and similarly predictive using only contact-network variables (0·88 [0·86–0·90]). Prediction was reduced when using only hospital contextual (AUC-ROC 0·82 [95% CI 0·80–0·84]) or patient clinical (0·64 [0·62–0·66]) variables. A model with only three variables (ie, network closeness, direct contacts with infectious patients [network derived], and hospital COVID-19 prevalence [hospital contextual]) achieved AUC-ROC 0·85 (95% CI 0·82–0·88). Incorporating contact-network variables improved performance across both validation datasets (AUC-ROC in the Geneva dataset increased from 0·84 [95% CI 0·82–0·86] to 0·88 [0·86–0·90]; AUC-ROC in the UK post-surge dataset increased from 0·49 [0·46–0·52] to 0·68 [0·64–0·70]).
Interpretation
Dynamic contact networks are robust predictors of individual patient risk of HOCIs. Their integration in clinical care could enhance individualised infection prevention and early diagnosis of COVID-19 and other nosocomial infections.

AB  - Objective
This study aims to cost and calculate the relative cost-effectiveness of the hypothetical suppression policies found in the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team model.
Methods
Key population-level disease projections in deaths, intensive care unit bed days, and non–intensive care unit bed days were taken from the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team report of March 2020, which influenced the decision to introduce suppression policies in the United Kingdom. National income loss estimates were from a study that estimated the impact of a hypothetical pandemic on the UK economy, with sensitivity analyses based on projections that are more recent. Individual quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss and costed resource use inputs were taken from published sources.
Results
Imperial model projected suppression polices compared to an unmitigated pandemic, even with the most pessimistic national income loss scenarios under suppression (10%), give incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below £50 000 per QALY. Assuming a maximum reduction in national income of 7.75%, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for Imperial model projected suppression versus mitigation are below 60 000 per QALY.
Conclusions
Results are uncertain and conditional on the accuracy of the Imperial model projections; they are also sensitive to estimates of national income loss. Nevertheless, it would be difficult to claim that the hypothetical Imperial model–projected suppression policies are obviously cost-ineffective relative to the alternatives available. Despite evolving differences between government policy and Imperial model–projected suppression policy, it is hoped this article will provide some early insight into the trade-offs that are involved.

AB  - This paper examines the daily abnormal stock price returns of a sample of 154 publicly-traded hospitality firms from 23 different countries representing over $400 billion in combined market capitalization around the time that COVID-19 was first viewed by stock market participants as a major—possibly even existential—threat. The findings of the study suggest that, financially, hotels performed better than restaurants, which themselves performed better than casinos. These findings are consistent with medical recommendations concerning the relative safety of various hospitality-related activities and, therefore, also with the tenets of financial market efficiency in the hospitality sector. Additional findings suggest that hospitality firms with strong balance sheets and income statements characterized by relatively low leverage ratios, high market value (consistent with a “too big to fail” mentality), and higher price/earnings ratios (implying higher relative profitability) all fared better than smaller, weaker firms. Although, in no case, did Bloomberg's proprietary environmental, social, and governance (ESG) variable possess any predictive power, variables reflecting cross-country cultural differences support Huynh’s (2020) finding that “individualism” was an important factor in explaining the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitality firms.

AB  - As the world navigates the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is a growing need to assess its impact in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Patients with SLE are a unique population when considering the risk of contracting COVID-19 and infection outcomes. The use of systemic glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants, and underlying organ damage from SLE are potential susceptibility factors. Most patients with SLE have evidence of high type I interferon activity, which may theoretically act as an antiviral line of defense or contribute to the development of a deleterious hyperinflammatory response in COVID-19. Other immunopathogenic mechanisms of SLE may overlap with those described in COVID-19, thus, studies in SLE could provide some insight into immune responses occurring in severe cases of the viral infection. We reviewed the literature to date on COVID-19 in patients with SLE and provide an in-depth review of current research in the area, including immune pathway activation, epidemiology, clinical features, outcomes, and the psychosocial impact of the pandemic in those with autoimmune disease.
