AB  - The largest burden of COVID-19 is carried by the elderly, and persons living in nursing homes are particularly vulnerable. However, 94% of the global population is younger than 70 years and 86% is younger than 60 years. The objective of this study was to accurately estimate the infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID-19 among non-elderly people in the absence of vaccination or prior infection. In systematic searches in SeroTracker and PubMed (protocol: https://osf.io/xvupr), we identified 40 eligible national seroprevalence studies covering 38 countries with pre-vaccination seroprevalence data. For 29 countries (24 high-income, 5 others), publicly available age-stratified COVID-19 death data and age-stratified seroprevalence information were available and were included in the primary analysis. The IFRs had a median of 0.034% (interquartile range (IQR) 0.013–0.056%) for the 0–59 years old population, and 0.095% (IQR 0.036–0.119%) for the 0–69 years old. The median IFR was 0.0003% at 0–19 years, 0.002% at 20–29 years, 0.011% at 30–39 years, 0.035% at 40–49 years, 0.123% at 50–59 years, and 0.506% at 60–69 years. IFR increases approximately 4 times every 10 years. Including data from another 9 countries with imputed age distribution of COVID-19 deaths yielded median IFR of 0.025–0.032% for 0–59 years and 0.063–0.082% for 0–69 years. Meta-regression analyses also suggested global IFR of 0.03% and 0.07%, respectively in these age groups. The current analysis suggests a much lower pre-vaccination IFR in non-elderly populations than previously suggested. Large differences did exist between countries and may reflect differences in comorbidities and other factors. These estimates provide a baseline from which to fathom further IFR declines with the widespread use of vaccination, prior infections, and evolution of new variants.

AB  - A large number of studies have examined individual-level factors that increase COVID-19 fatalities. However, no research has focused on the geodemographic classification of the most susceptible communities to COVID-19. In this cross-sectional ecological study, we used local fuzzy geographically-weighted clustering to create the socioeconomic profile of the US counties in relation to COVID-19 death rates. We demonstrate that living in a county which has households with lower income, people with a lack of health insurance, a high African-American percentage, and lower education level, lead to 27.12% higher COVID-19 death rates than the national median, and 72.56% higher compared to the least vulnerable counties. Compared to counties with a high COVID-19 death rate, counties with a low COVID-19 death rate have 44.90% higher annual median household income and nearly double house worth (89.51% more). Results show that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not universal and that the minoritised and impoverished populations suffer more. Our analysis can effectively pinpoint the most vulnerable counties and importantly allows for understanding the socioeconomic context in which tailored interventions can be applied to mitigate COVID-19 deaths.

AB  - Today, the entire world is battling to contain the spread of COVID-19. Massive efforts are being made to find a therapeutic solution in the shortest possible time. However, the research community is becoming increasingly concerned about taking a shortsighted strategy without contemplating the long-term consequences. For example, It has been reported that only 8.4% of total COVID-19 patients develop a secondary bacterial infection. In comparison, 74.6% of them are administered with antibiotics as prophylactic treatment. We contend that overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics increases the likelihood of AMR development and negatively affects the patient's recovery due to the prevalence of the "gut-lung axis.". Consequently, the use of antibiotics to treat COVID-19 patients must be rationalized, or an alternative treatment must be sought that does not risk contributing to AMR development and positively impacts the treatment outcomes. Phage therapy, a century-old concept, is one of the most promising approaches that can be adapted to serve this purpose. This review emphasizes the negative impact of excessive antibiotic use in COVID-19 treatment and provides an overview of how phage therapy can be used as an alternative treatment option. We have argued that targeted killing (narrow spectrum) and anti-inflammatory (which can target the primary cause of mortality in COVID-19) properties of phages can be an effective alternative to antibiotics.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - a novel coronavirus has rapid spread, and caused community infection around the globe. During the absence of a vaccine, people focused more on an immunity-boosting diet and needed clear knowledge about immunity-boosting foods. However, after the vaccination drive, the importance of food as a natural source of immunomodulation cannot be neglected. So, the purpose of this review was to describe the role of vital nutrient in boosting immune system of body apart from other factors like adequate sleep, exercise, and low stress levels. Macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, B-cells, and T-cells are the important components having important role in maintaining immunity of the human body. The first four-act as the initial mediators of innate host defense, and the latter two produce antibodies for pathogen destruction. The review investigated vital nutrients like vitamin-C, A, E and D, iron, zinc, folic acid, probiotics, and prebiotics affecting these immune components in some extent. Fruits, vegetables, spices, herbs, seeds, nuts, cereals, millets, and superfoods like chlorella and spirulina are good sources of these nutrients. However, fortified foods, functional foods, encapsulated foods with bioactive compounds and plant-based foods have shown immense potential in boosting immunity against viral infections like COVID-19. Some clinical trials and retrospective cohort studies have shown reduction in the severity of COVID-19 patients with relation to plant-based diet, vitamin D and C doses, probiotic, and zinc salts application.

AB  - How will the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic develop in the coming months and years? Based on an expert survey, we examine key aspects that are likely to influence the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. The challenges and developments will strongly depend on the progress of national and global vaccination programs, the emergence and spread of variants of concern (VOCs), and public responses to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). In the short term, many people remain unvaccinated, VOCs continue to emerge and spread, and mobility and population mixing are expected to increase. Therefore, lifting restrictions too much and too early risk another damaging wave. This challenge remains despite the reduced opportunities for transmission given vaccination progress and reduced indoor mixing in summer 2021. In autumn 2021, increased indoor activity might accelerate the spread again, whilst a necessary reintroduction of NPIs might be too slow. The incidence may strongly rise again, possibly filling intensive care units, if vaccination levels are not high enough. A moderate, adaptive level of NPIs will thus remain necessary. These epidemiological aspects combined with economic, social, and health-related consequences provide a more holistic perspective on the future of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic developed the severest public health event in recent history. The first stage for defence has already been documented. This paper moves forward to contribute to the second stage for offensive by assessing the energy and environmental impacts related to vaccination. The vaccination campaign is a multidisciplinary topic incorporating policies, population behaviour, planning, manufacturing, materials supporting, cold-chain logistics and waste treatment. The vaccination for pandemic control in the current phase is prioritised over other decisions, including energy and environmental issues. This study documents that vaccination should be implemented in maximum sustainable ways. The energy and related emissions of a single vaccination are not massive; however, the vast numbers related to the worldwide production, logistics, disinfection, implementation and waste treatment are reaching significant figures. The preliminary assessment indicates that the energy is at the scale of ~1.08 × 1010 kWh and related emissions of ~5.13 × 1012 gCO2eq when embedding for the envisaged 1.56 × 1010 vaccine doses. The cold supply chain is estimated to constitute 69.8% of energy consumption of the vaccination life cycle, with an interval of 26–99% depending on haul distance. A sustainable supply chain model that responds to an emergency arrangement, considering equality as well, should be emphasised to mitigate vaccination's environmental footprint. This effort plays a critical role in preparing for future pandemics, both environmentally and socially. Research in exploring sustainable single-use or reusable materials is also suggested to be a part of the plans. Diversified options could offer higher flexibility in mitigating environmental footprint even during the emergency and minimise the potential impact of material disruption or dependency.

AB  - We overcome a lack of frontline worker status information in most COVID-19 data repositories to document the extent to which occupation has contributed to COVID-19 disparities in the United States. Using national data from over a million U.S. respondents to a Facebook-Carnegie Mellon University survey administered from September 2020 to March 2021, we estimated the likelihoods of frontline workers, compared to non-frontline workers, 1) to ever test positive for SARs-Cov-2 and 2) to test positive for SARs-Cov-2 within the past two weeks. Net of other covariates including education level, county-level political environment, and rural residence, both healthcare and non-healthcare frontline workers had higher odds of having ever tested positive for SARs-Cov-2 across the study time period. Similarly, non-healthcare frontline workers were more likely to test positive in the previous 14 days. Conversely, healthcare frontline workers were less likely to have recently tested positive. Our findings suggest that occupational exposure has played an independent role in the uneven spread of the virus. In particular, non-healthcare frontline workers have experienced sustained higher risk of testing positive for SARs-Cov-2 compared to non-frontline workers. Alongside more worker protections, future COVID-19 and other highly infectious disease response strategies must be augmented by a more robust recognition of the role that structural factors, such as the highly stratified U.S. occupational landscape, have played in the uneven toll of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This facilitates identification of relative influences of several causal factors as “shocks” to the model, including mandatory business closures, disease spread trajectories, behavioral responses, resilience, pent-up demand, and government stimulus packages. The analysis is grounded in primary data on avoidance behavior and healthcare parameters. The decomposition of the influence of various causal factors will help policymakers offset the negative influences and reinforce the positive ones during the remainder of this pandemic and future ones.

AB  - Background
There is concern that the COVID-19 pandemic could severely disrupt HIV services in sub-Saharan Africa. However, it is difficult to determine priorities for maintaining different elements of existing HIV services given widespread uncertainty.
Methods
We explore the impact of disruptions on HIV outcomes in South Africa, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Uganda using a mathematical model, examine how impact is affected by model assumptions, and compare potential HIV deaths to those that may be caused by COVID-19 in the same settings.
Findings
The most important determinant of HIV-related mortality is an interruption to antiretroviral treatment (ART) supply. A three-month interruption for 40% of those on ART could cause a similar number of additional deaths as those that might be saved from COVID-19 through social distancing. An interruption for more than 6–90% of individuals on ART for nine months could cause the number of HIV deaths to exceed the number of COVID-19 deaths, depending on the COVID-19 projection. However, if ART supply is maintained, but new treatment, voluntary medical male circumcision, and pre-exposure prophylaxis initiations cease for 3 months and condom use is reduced, increases in HIV deaths would be limited to <2% over five years, although this could still be accompanied by a 7% increase in new HIV infections.
Interpretation
HIV deaths could increase substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic under reasonable worst-case assumptions about interruptions to HIV services. It is a priority in high-burden countries to ensure continuity of ART during the pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents an unprecedented challenge to global public health. At the time of this review, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in over 40 million cases and associated with 1.1 million deaths worldwide. Current management strategies for COVID-19 are largely supportive, and while there are more than 2000 interventional clinical trials registered with the U.S. National Library of Medicine (clinicaltrials.gov), results that can clarify benefits and risks of candidate therapies are only gradually becoming available. We herein describe recent advances in understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology and potential therapeutic targets that are involved in viral entry into host cells, viral spread in the body, and the subsequent COVID-19 progression. We highlight two major lines of therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment: 1) repurposing the existing drugs for use in COVID-19 patients, such as antiviral medications (e.g., remdesivir) and immunomodulators (e.g., dexamethasone) which were previously approved for other disease conditions, and 2) novel biological products that are designed to target specific molecules that are involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, including neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, such as REGN-COV2 (an antibody cocktail), as well as recombinant human soluble ACE2 protein to counteract SARS-CoV-2 binding to the transmembrane ACE2 receptor in target cells. Finally, we discuss potential drug resistance mechanisms and provide thoughts regarding clinical trial design to address the diversity in COVID-19 clinical manifestation. Of note, preventive vaccines, cell and gene therapies are not within the scope of the current review.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 pandemic has affected routine immunization globally. Impact will likely be higher in low and middle-income countries with limited healthcare resources and fragile health systems. We quantified the impact, spatial heterogeneity, and determinants for childhood immunizations of 48 million population affected in the Sindh province of Pakistan.
Methods
We extracted individual immunization records from real-time provincial Electronic Immunization Registry from September 23, 2019, to July 11, 2020. Comparing baseline (6 months preceding the lockdown) and the COVID-19 lockdown period, we analyzed the impact on daily immunization coverage rate for each antigen by geographical area. We used multivariable logistic regression to explore the predictors associated with immunizations during the lockdown.
Results
There was a 52.5% decline in the daily average total number of vaccinations administered during lockdown compared to baseline. The highest decline was seen for Bacille Cal­mette Guérin (BCG) (40.6% (958/2360) immunization at fixed sites. Around 8438 children/day were missing immunization during the lockdown. Enrollments declined furthest in rural districts, urban sub-districts with large slums, and polio-endemic super high-risk sub-districts. Pentavalent-3 (penta-3) immunization rates were higher in infants born in hospitals (RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.04–1.15) and those with mothers having higher education (RR: 1.19–1.50; 95% CI: 1.13–1.65). Likelihood of penta-3 immunization was reduced by 5% for each week of delayed enrollment into the immunization program.
Conclusion
One out of every two children in Sindh province has missed their routine vaccinations during the provincial COVID-19 lockdown. The pool of un-immunized children is expanding during lockdown, leaving them susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases. There is a need for tailored interventions to promote immunization visits and safe service delivery. Higher maternal education, facility-based births, and early enrollment into the immunization program continue to show a positive association with immunization uptake, even during a challenging lockdown.

AB  - The highly transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen of the COVID-19 pandemic, bring new waves of infection worldwide. Identification of effective therapeutic drugs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent global need. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), an essential enzyme for viral RNA replication, is the most promising target for antiviral drug research since it has no counterpart in human cells and shows the highest conservation across coronaviruses. This review summarizes recent progress in studies of RdRp inhibitors, focusing on interactions between these inhibitors and the enzyme complex, based on structural analysis, and their effectiveness. In addition, we propose new possible strategies to address the shortcomings of current inhibitors, which may guide the development of novel efficient inhibitors to combat COVID-19.

AB  - Recently, the COVID-19 disease spread has emerged as a worldwide pandemic and cause severe threats to humanity. The World Health Organisation (WHO) releases guidelines to help the countries to reduce the spread of this virus to the public, like wearing masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, shutting down all types of public transports, etc. These conditions led to a worldwide economic fall drastically, and on the other hand, indirect environmental benefits like global air quality improvement and decreased water pollution are also pictured. Currently, use of face masks is part of a comprehensive package of the prevention and control measures that can limit the spread of COVID-19 since there is no clinically proven drugs or vaccine available for COVID-19. Mostly, face masks are made of petroleum-based non-renewable polymers that are non-biodegradable, hazardous to the environment and create health issues. This study demonstrates the extensive use of the face mask and how it affects human health and the marine ecosystem. It has become a great challenge for the government sectors to impose strict regulations for the proper disposal of the masks as medical waste by the public. Neglecting the seriousness of this issue may lead to the release of large tonnes of micro-plastics to the landfill as well as to the marine environment where mostly end-up and thereby affecting their fauna and flora population vastly. Besides, this study highlights the COVID-19 spread, its evolutionary importance, taxonomy, genomic structure, transmission to humans, prevention, and treatment.

AB  - Background
While the world is experiencing another wave of COVID-19 pandemic, global vaccination program is hampered by an evident shortage in the supply of licensed vaccines. In an effort to satisfy vaccine demands we developed a new single-dose vaccine based on recombinant adenovirus type 26 (rAd26) vector carrying the gene for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) glycoprotein – “Sputnik Light”.
Methods
We conducted an open label, prospective, non-randomised phase 1/2 trial aimed to assess safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of “Sputnik Light” vaccine in a single center in Russia. Primary outcome measures were antigen-specific humoral immunity (Anti-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies measured by ELISA on days 1, 10, 28, and 42) and safety (number of participants with adverse events monitored throughout the study). Secondary outcome measures were antigen-specific cellular immunity (measured by antigen-dependent CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proliferation, number of antigen-specific interferon-γ-producing cells as well as interferon-γ concentration upon antigen restimulation) and change in neutralizing antibodies (measured in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay).
Findings
Most of the solicited adverse reactions were mild (66·4% from all vaccinees), few were moderate (5·5%). No serious adverse events were detected. Assessment of Anti-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies revealed a group with pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Upon this finding we separated all safety and immunogenicity data based on pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2. There were notable differences in the vaccine effects on immunogenicity by the groups. Vaccination of seropositive (N=14) volunteers rapidly boosted RBD-specific IgGs from reciprocal geometric mean titer (​GMT) 594·4 at a baseline up to 26899 comparing to 29·09 in seronegative group (N=96) by day 10. By day 42 seroconversion rate reached 100% (93/93) in seronegative group with GMT 1648. At the same time, in the seropositive group, seroconversion rate by day 42 was 92·9% (13/14) with GMT 19986. Analysis of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 showed 81·7% (76/93) and 92·9% (13/14) seroconversion rates by day 42 with median reciprocal GMT 15·18 and 579·7 in the seronegative and seropositive groups, respectively. Antigen-specific T cell proliferation, formation of IFNy-producing cells, and IFNy secretion were observed in 96·7% (26/27), 96% (24/25), and 96% (24/25) of the seronegative group respectively and in 100% (3/3), 100% (5/5), and 100% (5/5) of the seropositive vaccinees, respectively.
Interpretation
The single-dose rAd26 vector-based COVID-19 vaccine “Sputnik Light” has a good safety profile and induces a strong humoral and cellular immune responses both in seronegative and seropositive participants.

AB  - Background
Due to lack of approved drugs and vaccines, the medical world has resorted to older drugs, produced for viral infections and other diseases, as a remedy to combat COVID-19. The accumulating evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have demonstrated that several polyphenols found in plants and zinc- polyphenol clusters have been in use as herbal medicines have antiviral activities against viruses with various mechanisms.
Scope of review
Curcumin, zinc and zinc-ionophores have been considered as nutraceuticals and nutrients showing great antiviral activities with their medicinal like activities.
Major conclusions
In this work, we discussed the potential prophylactic and/or therapeutic effects of curcumin, zinc and zinc-ionophores in treatment of viral infections including COVID-19.
General significance
Curcuminoids and Zinc classified as nutraceuticals under GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) by FDA can provide complementary treatment for COVID 19 patients with their immunity-boosting and antiviral properties.

AB  - Since the first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019, it is now recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) as more than 200 countries and territories worldwide are affected with an increasing incidence. The SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a spectrum of non-specific signs and symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic infection, to flu-like illness such as fever, cough, dry cough and fatigue, to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even multi-organ failures with high morbidity and mortality. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets that infected people exhale during incubation and onset period. By 12 June 2020, over 7.5 million confirmed cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with more than 421,000 deaths in the world have been reported to the WHO. No specific medication is approved to treat COVID-19, raising the urgent need for antiviral drug development. By 12 June 2020, there are over 1000 clinical trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov for treatment of COVID-19. This review summarizes the epidemiology, virology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and particularly the antiviral drugs currently under clinical trials for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, together with the challenges and perspectives of this disease are also discussed.

AB  - This work attempts to shed light on whether the COVID-19 pandemic rides on airborne pollution. In particular, a two-city study provides evidence that PM2.5 contributes to the timing and severity of the epidemic, without adjustment for confounders. The publicly available data of deaths between March and October 2020, updated it on May 30, 2021, and the average seasonal concentrations of PM2.5 pollution over the previous years in Thessaloniki, the second-largest city of Greece, were investigated. It was found that changes in coronavirus-related deaths follow changes in air pollution and that the correlation between the two data sets is maximized at the lag time of one month. Similar data from Tehran were gathered for comparison. The results of this study underscore that it is possible, if not likely, that pollution nanoparticles are related to COVID-19 fatalities (Granger causality, p < 0.05), contributing to the understanding of the environmental impact on pandemics.

AB  - Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a major global cause of neonatal meningitis, sepsis and pneumonia, with an estimated 91,000 infant deaths per year and an additional 46,000 stillbirths. GBS infection in pregnancy is also associated with adverse maternal outcomes and preterm births. As such, the World Health Organization (WHO) prioritised the development of a GBS vaccine suitable for use in pregnant women and use in LMICs, where the burden of disease is highest. Several GBS vaccines are in clinical development. The WHO Defeating Meningitis by 2030 has set a target of 2026 for vaccine licensure. This ‘Vaccine Value Profile’ (VVP) for GBS is intended to provide a high-level, holistic assessment of the information and data that are currently available to inform the potential public health, economic and societal value of pipeline vaccines and vaccine-like products. This VVP was developed by a working group of subject matter experts from academia, non-profit organizations, public private partnerships and multi-lateral organizations, and in collaboration with stakeholders from the WHO regions of AFR, AMR, EUR, WPR. All contributors have extensive expertise on various elements of the GBS VVP and collectively aimed to identify current research and knowledge gaps. The VVP was developed using only existing and publicly available information.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated the importance of implementing strategic management that prioritizes the safety of frontline nurse professionals. In this sense, this research was aimed at identifying factors associated with the illness of nursing professionals caused by COVID-19 according to socio-demographic, clinical, and labor variables.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in three Brazilian university hospitals with 859 nursing professionals, which include nurses, technicians, and nursing assistants, between November 2020 and February 2021. We present data using absolute and relative frequency. We used Chi-square test for hypothesis testing and multiple logistic regression for predictive analysis and chances of occurrence.
Results
The rate of nursing professionals affected by COVID-19 was 41.8%, and the factors associated with contamination were the number of people in the same household with COVID-19 and obesity. Being a nurse was a protective factor when the entire nursing team was considered. The model is significant, and its variables represent 56.61% of the occurrence of COVID-19 in nursing professionals.
Conclusion
Obesity and living in the same household as other people affected by COVID-19 increases the risk of contamination by this new coronavirus.

AB  - We reviewed surgical cases from 4 Thoracic Surgery departments in the Lombardia region of Italy, the area mostly affected by Coronavirus pandemic in Europe, with the aim to describe the impact of COVID-19 on the treatment of thoracic surgical patients. Clinical, radiological and laboratory data from patients who underwent lung resection from December 2019 to March 2020 were retrospectively collected until June 2020. Univariable Cox regression models were estimated to evaluate potential prognostic factors for developing COVID-19 and to investigate postoperative mortality among patients who developed symptomatic COVID-19 infection. We examined data from 107 patients. (74 lobectomies, 32 wedge/segmentectomies and 1 pneumonectomy). Twelve patients developed COVID-19 (Group 1), whereas 95 patients were not infected (Group 2). In Group 1, 6 patients (50%) died from complications related to infection; in Group 2, one patient (1%) died because of non-COVID-19-related causes. Median days from surgery to first symptoms, CT confirmation, clinical confirmation and PCR positivity was 48.1, 54.3, 55.1, and 55.2 respectively. At univariable analysis, DLCO/VA% (P = 0.008), duration of the surgery (P = 0.009), smoking history (pack/year) (P < 0.001), BMI (P< 0.001) and number of segments resected (P = 0.010) were associated with COVID-19 onset. Moreover, CCI (P < 0.001), DLCO/VA% (P = 0.002), cigarette pack/year (P < 0.001), BMI (P < 0.001) and COVID-19 (P < 0.001) were associated with death. Patients who undergo lung resection and then develop symptomatic COVID-19 infection are at higher risk of developing severe respiratory complications and postoperative death. Insidious symptoms’ onset may lead to a delay in diagnosis. We suggest two mitigating strategies: (1) Improve symptoms surveillance and isolation during recovery period, (2) Be aware of a potential greater risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 and death correlated with elevated CCI, BMI, smoking history, DLCO/VA%, number of resected segments and duration of surgery.

AB  - Background
Currently, novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak creates global panic across the continents, as people from almost all countries and territories have been affected by this highly contagious viral disease. The scenario is deteriorating due to lack of proper & specific target-oriented pharmacologically safe prophylactic agents or drugs, and or any effective vaccine. drug development is urgently required to back in the normalcy in the community and to combat this pandemic.
Purpose
Thus, we have proposed two novel drug targets, Furin and TMPRSS2, as Covid-19 treatment strategy. We have highlighted this target-oriented novel drug delivery strategy, based on their pathophysiological implication on SARS-CoV-2 infection, as evident from earlier SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and influenza virus infection via host cell entry, priming, fusion, and endocytosis.
Study design &  Methods
An earlier study suggested that Furin and TMPRSS2 knockout mice had reduced level of viral load and a lower degree of organ damage such as the lung. The present study thus highlights the promise of some selected novel and potential anti-viral Phytopharmaceutical that bind to Furin and TMPRSS2 as target.
Result
Few of them had shown promising anti-viral response in both preclinical and clinical study with acceptable therapeutic safety-index.
Conclusion
Hence, this strategy may limit life-threatening Covid-19 infection and its mortality rate through nano-suspension based intra-nasal or oral nebulizer spray, to treat mild to moderate SARS-COV-2 infection when Furin and TMPRSS2 receptor may initiate to express and activate for processing the virus to cause cellular infection by replication within the host cell and blocking of host-viral interaction.

AB  - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have implemented a complete lockdown of their population that may not be sustainable for long. To identify the best strategy to replace this full lockdown, sophisticated models that rely on mobility data have been developed. In this study, using the example of France as a case-study, we develop a simple model considering contacts between age classes to derive the general impact of partial lockdown strategies targeted at specific age groups. We found that epidemic suppression can only be achieved by targeting isolation of young and middle age groups with high efficiency. All other strategies tested result in a flatter epidemic curve, with outcomes in (e.g. mortality and health system over-capacity) dependent of the age groups targeted and the isolation efficiency. Targeting only the elderly can decrease the expected mortality burden, but in proportions lower than more integrative strategies involving several age groups. While not aiming to provide quantitative forecasts, our study shows the benefits and constraints of different partial lockdown strategies, which could help guide decision-making.

AB  - Emerging data show that the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 are being disproportionately borne by individuals who are not only biologically, but also socially vulnerable. Based on preliminary data from Sweden and other reports, in this paper we propose a conceptual framework whereby different factors related to biological and social vulnerability may explain the specific COVID-19 burden among older people. There is already some evidence showing large social disparities in the prevention, treatment, prognosis and/or long-term consequences of COVID-19. The remaining question is to what extent these affect older adults specifically. We provide the rationale to address this question with scientific methods and proper study designs, where the interplay between individuals’ biomedical status and their social environment is the focus. Only through interdisciplinary research integrating biological, clinical and social data will we be able to provide new insights into the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and inform actions aimed at reducing older adults’ vulnerability to COVID-19 or other similar pandemics in the future.

AB  - Background
In March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, and Tunisia implemented a containment and targeted screening strategy. The country's public health policy has since focused on managing hospital beds.
Methods
The study analyzed the bed occupancy rates in public hospitals in Tunisia during the pandemic. The evolution of daily cases and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) actions undertaken by the Tunisian Government were also analyzed. The study used 3 indices to assess bed flexibility: Ramp duration until the peak, ramp growth until the peak, and ramp rate until the peak. The study also calculated the time shift at the start and peak of each wave to evaluate the government's response efficacy.
Results
The study found that the evolution of the epidemic in Tunisia had 2 phases. The first phase saw the pandemic being controlled due to strong NPI actions, while the second phase saw a relaxation of measures and an increase in wave intensity. ICU bed availability followed the demand for beds, but ICU bed occupancy remained high, with a maximum of 97%. The government's response in terms of bed distribution and reallocation was slow. The study found that the most deadly wave by ICU occupied bed was the third wave due to a historical variant, while the fifth wave due to the delta variant was the most deadly in terms of cumulative death.
Conclusions
The study concluded that decision-makers could use its findings to assess their response capabilities in the current pandemic and future ones. The study highlighted the importance of flexible and responsive healthcare systems in managing pandemics.

AB  - The global pandemic caused by the newly described severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused worldwide suffering and death of unimaginable magnitude from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus is transmitted through aerosol droplets, and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor-binding domain of its spike protein S1 to attach to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in lung and airway cells. Binding requires the help of another host protein, transmembrane protease serine S1 member 2. Several factors likely contribute to the efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a 10- to 20-fold higher receptor-binding capacity compared with previous pandemic coronaviruses. In addition, because asymptomatic persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 have high viral loads in their nasal secretions, they can silently and efficiently spread the disease. PCR-based tests have emerged as the criterion standard for the diagnosis of infection. Caution must be exercised in interpreting antibody-based tests because they have not yet been validated, and may give a false sense of security of being “immune” to SARS-CoV-2. We discuss how the development of some symptoms in allergic rhinitis can serve as clues for new-onset COVID-19. There are mixed reports that asthma is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, possibly due to differences in asthma endotypes. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has focused the efforts of scientists on repurposing existing Food and Drug Administration–approved drugs that inhibit viral entry, endocytosis, genome assembly, translation, and replication. Numerous clinical trials have been launched to identify effective treatments for COVID-19. Initial data from a placebo-controlled study suggest faster time to recovery in patients on remdesivir; it is now being evaluated in additional controlled studies. As discussed in this review, till effective vaccines and treatments emerge, it is important to understand the scientific rationale of pandemic-mitigation strategies such as wearing facemasks and social distancing, and implement them.

AB  - Summary
Background
Before 2020, mental disorders were leading causes of the global health-related burden, with depressive and anxiety disorders being leading contributors to this burden. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has created an environment where many determinants of poor mental health are exacerbated. The need for up-to-date information on the mental health impacts of COVID-19 in a way that informs health system responses is imperative. In this study, we aimed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence and burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders globally in 2020.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review of data reporting the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic and published between Jan 1, 2020, and Jan 29, 2021. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, preprint servers, grey literature sources, and consulted experts. Eligible studies reported prevalence of depressive or anxiety disorders that were representative of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic and had a pre-pandemic baseline. We used the assembled data in a meta-regression to estimate change in the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders between pre-pandemic and mid-pandemic (using periods as defined by each study) via COVID-19 impact indicators (human mobility, daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, and daily excess mortality rate). We then used this model to estimate the change from pre-pandemic prevalence (estimated using Disease Modelling Meta-Regression version 2.1 [known as DisMod-MR 2.1]) by age, sex, and location. We used final prevalence estimates and disability weights to estimate years lived with disability and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders.
Findings
We identified 5683 unique data sources, of which 48 met inclusion criteria (46 studies met criteria for major depressive disorder and 27 for anxiety disorders). Two COVID-19 impact indicators, specifically daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and reductions in human mobility, were associated with increased prevalence of major depressive disorder (regression coefficient [B] 0·9 [95% uncertainty interval 0·1 to 1·8; p=0·029] for human mobility, 18·1 [7·9 to 28·3; p=0·0005] for daily SARS-CoV-2 infection) and anxiety disorders (0·9 [0·1 to 1·7; p=0·022] and 13·8 [10·7 to 17·0; p<0·0001]. Females were affected more by the pandemic than males (B 0·1 [0·1 to 0·2; p=0·0001] for major depressive disorder, 0·1 [0·1 to 0·2; p=0·0001] for anxiety disorders) and younger age groups were more affected than older age groups (−0·007 [–0·009 to −0·006; p=0·0001] for major depressive disorder, −0·003 [–0·005 to −0·002; p=0·0001] for anxiety disorders). We estimated that the locations hit hardest by the pandemic in 2020, as measured with decreased human mobility and daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, had the greatest increases in prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. We estimated an additional 53·2 million (44·8 to 62·9) cases of major depressive disorder globally (an increase of 27·6% [25·1 to 30·3]) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such that the total prevalence was 3152·9 cases (2722·5 to 3654·5) per 100 000 population. We also estimated an additional 76·2 million (64·3 to 90·6) cases of anxiety disorders globally (an increase of 25·6% [23·2 to 28·0]), such that the total prevalence was 4802·4 cases (4108·2 to 5588·6) per 100 000 population. Altogether, major depressive disorder caused 49·4 million (33·6 to 68·7) DALYs and anxiety disorders caused 44·5 million (30·2 to 62·5) DALYs globally in 2020.
Interpretation
This pandemic has created an increased urgency to strengthen mental health systems in most countries. Mitigation strategies could incorporate ways to promote mental wellbeing and target determinants of poor mental health and interventions to treat those with a mental disorder. Taking no action to address the burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders should not be an option.

AB  - Summary
Indigenous communities worldwide share common features that make them especially vulnerable to the complications of and mortality from COVID-19. They also possess resilient attributes that can be leveraged to promote prevention efforts. How can indigenous communities best mitigate potential devastating effects of COVID-19? In Bolivia, where nearly half of all citizens claim indigenous origins, no specific guidelines have been outlined for indigenous communities inhabiting native communal territories. In this Public Health article, we describe collaborative efforts, as anthropologists, physicians, tribal leaders, and local officials, to develop and implement a multiphase COVID-19 prevention and containment plan focused on voluntary collective isolation and contact-tracing among Tsimane forager-horticulturalists in the Bolivian Amazon. Phase 1 involves education, outreach, and preparation, and phase 2 focuses on containment, patient management, and quarantine. Features of this plan might be exported and adapted to local circumstances elsewhere to prevent widespread mortality in indigenous communities.

AB  - This paper identifies robust determinants of US stock price movements in the economic shadow of the COVID-19 crisis and in the presence of model uncertainty, using several influential factors highlighted in relevant research. Our investigation performs an extreme bounds analysis (EBA), a global sensitivity framework capable of handling the problem of model uncertainty. We document that excess market returns, term spread, implied volatility, oil, Twitter-based economic uncertainty, and European and Chinese stock returns are the only variables that are robust to all possible variations in the condition set of information. The results also reveal the irrelevance of newly reported COVID-19 cases and deaths as novel drivers that contribute to the formation stock prices, thus lending support to the “psychophysical numbing” phenomenon.

AB  - The viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 has increased the mortality rate and engaged several adverse effects on the affected individuals. Currently available antiviral drugs have found to be unsuccessful in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The demand for efficient antiviral drugs has created a huge burden on physicians and health workers. Plasma therapy seems to be less accomplishable due to insufficient donors to donate plasma and low recovery rate from viral infection. Repurposing of antivirals has been evolved as a suitable strategy in the current treatment and preventive measures. The concept of drug repurposing represents new experimental approaches for effective therapeutic benefits. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits several complications such as lung damage, blood clot formation, respiratory illness and organ failures in most of the patients. Based on the accumulation of data, sulfated marine polysaccharides have exerted successful inhibition of virus entry, attachment and replication with known or unknown possible mechanisms against deadly animal and human viruses so far. Since the virus entry into the host cells is the key process, the prevention of such entry mechanism makes any antiviral strategy effective. Enveloped viruses are more sensitive to polyanions than non-enveloped viruses. Besides, the viral infection caused by RNA virus types embarks severe oxidative stress in the human body that leads to malfunction of tissues and organs. In this context, polysaccharides play a very significant role in providing shielding effect against the virus due to their polyanionic rich features and a molecular weight that hinders their reactive surface glycoproteins. Significantly the functional groups especially sulfate, sulfate pattern and addition, uronic acids, monosaccharides, glycosidic linkage and high molecular weight have greater influence in the antiviral activity. Moreover, they are very good antioxidants that can reduce the free radical generation and provokes intracellular antioxidant enzymes. Additionally, polysaccharides enable a host-virus immune response, activate phagocytosis and stimulate interferon systems. Therefore, polysaccharides can be used as candidate drugs, adjuvants in vaccines or combination with other antivirals, antioxidants and immune-activating nutritional supplements and antiviral materials in healthcare products to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, most US states have taken measures of varying strength, enforcing social and physical distancing in the interest of public safety. These measures have enabled counties and states, with varying success, to slow down the propagation and mortality of the disease by matching the propagation rate to the capacity of medical facilities. However, each state’s government was making its decisions based on limited information and without the benefit of being able to look retrospectively at the problem at large and to analyze the commonalities and the differences among the states and the counties across the country. We developed models connecting people’s mobility, socioeconomic, and demographic factors with severity of the COVID pandemic in the US at the County level. These models can be used to inform policymakers and other stakeholders on measures to be taken during a pandemic. They also enable in-depth analysis of factors affecting the relationship between mobility and the severity of the disease. With the exception of one model, that of COVID recovery time, the resulting models accurately predict the vulnerability and severity metrics and rank the explanatory variables in the order of statistical importance. We also analyze and explain why recovery time did not allow for a good model.

AB  - Introduction
During the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic health record (EHR) data has been used to investigate disease severity and risk factors for severe COVID-19 in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). Methodological challenges including sampling bias, and residual confounding should be considered when conducting EHR-based studies. We aimed to address these limitations related to the use of EHR data in order to identify risk factors, including the use of disease modifying therapies (DMTs), associated with hospitalization for COVID-19 amongst pwMS.
Methods
We performed a retrospective cohort study including a sample of 47,051 pwMS using a large US-based EHR and claims linked database. Follow-up started at the beginning of the pandemic, February 20th 2020, and continued until September 30th 2020. COVID-19 diagnosis was determined by the presence of ICD-10 diagnostic code for COVID-19, or a positive diagnostic laboratory test, or an ICD-10 diagnostic code for coronaviruses. We used Cox regression modeling to assess the impact of baseline demographics, MS disease history and pre-existing comorbidities on the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. Then, we identified 5,169 pwMS using ocrelizumab (OCR) and 3,351 pwMS using dimethyl fumarate (DMF) at baseline, and evaluated the distribution of the identified COVID-19 risk factors between the two groups. Finally, we used Cox regression models, adjusted for the identified confounders, to estimate the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 in pwMS treated with OCR compared to DMF.
Results
Among the pwMS cohort, we identified 799 COVID-19 cases (1.7%) which resulted in 182 hospitalizations for COVID-19 (0.4%). Population differences between the pwMS and COVID-19 cohorts were observed. Statistical modeling identified older age, male gender, African-American race, walking with assistance, non-ambulatory status, severe relapse requiring hospitalization in year prior to baseline, and specific comorbidities to be associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 related-hospitalization. Comparing the COVID-19 risk factors between OCR users and DMF users, MS characteristics including ambulatory status and MS subtype were highly imbalanced, likely arising from key differences in the labelled indications for these therapies. Compared to DMF use, in unadjusted (HR 1.58, 95% CI 0.73 - 3.44), adjusted (HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.58 - 2.83), propensity score weighted (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.56 - 2.80), and doubly robust models (HR 1.29, 95% CI 0.57 - 2.89), no significantly increased risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 was associated with OCR use.
Conclusion
We observed significant population differences when comparing all pwMS to COVID-19 cases, as well as significant differences in key confounders between OCR and DMF treated patients. In unadjusted analyses we did not observe a statistically significant higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization in pwMS treated with OCR compared to DMF, with further attenuation of risk when adjusting for the key confounders. This study re-emphasises the importance to appropriately consider both sampling and confounding bias in EHR-based MS research.

This paper summarizes the impact of the pandemic on different areas of public policy affecting healthy living and cardiovascular health including prevention (i.e., nutrition, physical activity, air quality, tobacco use), risk factors for chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, substance abuse), access to health care, care delivery and payment reform, telehealth and digital health, research, and employment policy. The paper underscores where public policy is evolving and where there are needs for future evidence base to inform policy development, and the intersections between the public and private sectors across the policy continuum. There is a continued need for global multi-sector coordination to optimize population health.

AB  - Summary
Background
Healthcare-acquired COVID-19 has been an additional burden on hospitals managing increasing numbers of patients with SARS-CoV-2. One acute hospital (W) among three in a Scottish healthboard experienced an unexpected surge of COVID-19 clusters.
Aim
To investigate possible causes of COVID-19 clusters at Hospital W.
Methods
Daily surveillance provided total numbers of patients and staff involved in clusters in three acute hospitals (H, M and W) and care homes across the healthboard. All clusters were investigated and documented, along with patient boarding, community infection rates and outdoor temperatures from October 2020 to March 2021. Selected SARS-CoV-2 strains were genotyped.
Findings
There were 19 COVID-19 clusters on 14 wards at Hospital W during the six-month study period, lasting from two to 42 days (average, five days; median, 14 days) and involving an average of nine patients (range 1–24) and seven staff (range 0–17). COVID-19 clusters in Hospitals H and M reflected community infection rates. An outbreak management team implemented a control package including daily surveillance; ward closures; universal masking; screening; restricting staff and patient movement; enhanced cleaning; and improved ventilation. Forty clusters occurred across all three hospitals before a January window-opening policy, after which there were three during the remainder of the study.
Conclusion
The winter surge of COVID-19 clusters was multi-factorial, but clearly exacerbated by moving trauma patients around the hospital. An extended infection prevention and control package including enhanced natural ventilation helped reduce COVID-19 clusters in acute hospitals.

AB  - New York City, the most populated urban center in the United States, is exposed to a variety of natural hazards. These range from extratropical storms and coastal flooding to extreme heat and cold temperatures, and have been shown to unevenly impact the various vulnerable groups in the city. As the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020 and the city became an early epicenter, disparities in exposure led to widely uneven infection and mortality rates. This study maps the overlapping heat and COVID-19 risks in New York City with a multi-hazard risk framework during Summer 2020. To do so, we simulate neighborhood scale temperatures using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with a multi-layer urban parameterization. Simulation outputs were combined with zipcode-scale COVID-19 and sociodemographic data to compute a multi-hazard risk index. Our results highlight several regions where high social vulnerability, COVID-19 infection rates, and heat coincide. Moreover, we use the local indicators of spatial association technique to map regions of spatially correlated high multi-hazard risk in the NYC boroughs of The Bronx and parts of Brooklyn and Queens. These high risk locations account for nearly a quarter of the city's population, with households earning less than half than those in the lowest risk zones.

AB  - To date, no country has reached a natural COVID-19 epidemic peak and observed peaks essentially reflect the effectiveness of ‘lockdown’ measures. The major challenge is finding a responsible way out of ‘lockdown’, given that SARS- CoV-2 is now an established global pathogen. Acknowledging limitations in our knowledge regarding the sufficiency and durability of immune responses following natural SARS Cov-2 infection, we discuss three pathways to ‘community protection’. Uncontrolled epidemic spread (route 1; R0>2) has been associated with overwhelmed health care systems and high death rates, especially in the vulnerable. Controlled epidemic spread (route 2; effective R0 1–2) can be achieved with limited or strict control of social mixing; strict control will be necessary to ensure that only low-risk individuals become infected, without spill-over to vulnerable groups during their period of infectiousness. It has been demonstrated that local epidemic elimination (route 3; effective R0<1) can be achieved through prolonged ‘lock down’, supplemented by early active case finding with quarantine of close contacts to ensure rapid termination of transmission chains within the community. Although universal availability of a safe and effective vaccine remains the preferred ‘exit strategy’, this may be hard to achieve and alternative options must be considered with careful consideration of all adverse outcomes – including health, social and economic consequences.

AB  - COVID-19 disease has put life of people in stress worldwide from many aspects. Since the virus has mutated in absolutely short period of time the challenge to find a suitable vaccine has become harder. Infection to COVID-19, especially at severe life threatening states is highly dependent on the strength of the host immune system. This system is partially dependent on the balance between oxidative stress and antioxidant. Besides, this virus still has unknown mechanism of action companied by a probable commune period. From another hand, some reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels can be helpful on the state determination of the disease. Thus it could be possible to use modern bioanalytical techniques for their detection and determination, which could indicate the disease state at the golden time window since they have the potential to show whether specific DNA, RNA, enzymes and proteins are affected. This also could be used as a preclude study or a reliable pathway to define the best optimized time of cure beside effective medical actions. Herein, some ROS and their relation with SARS-CoV-2 virus have been considered. In addition, modern bioelectroanalytical techniques on this approach from quantitative and qualitative points of view have been reviewed.

AB  - Objectives
Nursing homes (NHs) are important health care and residential environments for the growing number of frail older adults. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of NHs as they became COVID-19 hotspots. This study examines the associations of NH design with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility and provides relevant design recommendations.
Design
A cross-sectional, nationwide study was conducted after combining multiple national data sets about NHs.
Setting and Participants
A total of 7785 NHs were included in the study, which represent 50.8% of all Medicare and/or Medicaid NH providers in the United States.
Methods
Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID-19 resident cases and deaths, separately. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict log(R0 – 1). Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs’ resident characteristics, management and rating factors, and physical environmental features.
Results
Increased percentage of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator-dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. After setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases and other variables, increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled.
Conclusions and Implications
Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.

AB  - Propolis, a resinous material produced by honey bees from plant exudates, has long been used in traditional herbal medicine and is widely consumed as a health aid and immune system booster. The COVID-19 pandemic has renewed interest in propolis products worldwide; fortunately, various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism are potential targets for propolis compounds. SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is characterized by viral spike protein interaction with cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serine protease TMPRSS2. This mechanism involves PAK1 overexpression, which is a kinase that mediates coronavirus-induced lung inflammation, fibrosis, and immune system suppression. Propolis components have inhibitory effects on the ACE2, TMPRSS2 and PAK1 signaling pathways; in addition, antiviral activity has been proven in vitro and in vivo. In pre-clinical studies, propolis promoted immunoregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including reduction in IL-6, IL-1 beta and TNF-α. This immunoregulation involves monocytes and macrophages, as well as Jak2/STAT3, NF-kB, and inflammasome pathways, reducing the risk of cytokine storm syndrome, a major mortality factor in advanced COVID-19 disease. Propolis has also shown promise as an aid in the treatment of various of the comorbidities that are particularly dangerous in COVID-19 patients, including respiratory diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. Standardized propolis products with consistent bioactive properties are now available. Given the current emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and limited therapeutic options, propolis is presented as a promising and relevant therapeutic option that is safe, easy to administrate orally and is readily available as a natural supplement and functional food.

AB  - Introduction
: The impact of vaccination and casirivimab-imdevimab monoclonal antibody treatment on the clinical outcome of COVID-19 during a period of SARS-CoV-2 Delta surge is not known.
Aim and Methods
: All patients with COVID-19 at our facilities in the US Midwest were enrolled to assess breakthrough cases among vaccinated individuals and to compare the rates of hospitalization between casirivimab-imdevimab treated versus untreated patients. The study period occurred in July 2021 during a period dominated by the Delta variant.
Results
: The majority (68.1%) of 630 COVID-19 cases occurred in unvaccinated individuals. Among 403 patients eligible for monoclonal antibody treatment, the 28-day hospitalization rate was 2.6% of 112 patients who received treatment with casirivimab-imdevimab, compared to 16.6% of 291 eligible high-risk patients who did not receive casirivimab-imdevimab (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.138, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.0426–0.4477, p = 0.001). Casirivimab-imdevimab treatment was associated with lower rates of hospitalization among the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts.
Conclusions
: During a SARS-CoV-2 Delta surge, breakthrough COVID-19 occurred among vaccinated persons, especially among those with multiple medical comorbidities. Casirivimab-imdevimab treatment was associated with significantly lower rates of hospitalization in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons.

AB  - Summary
Hospital-onset COVID-19 infections (HOCIs) are associated with excess morbidity and mortality in patients and healthcare workers. The aim of this review was to explore and describe the current literature in HOCI surveillance. Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and MedRxiv were searched up to 30 November 2020 using broad search criteria. Articles of HOCI surveillance systems were included. Data describing HOCI definitions, HOCI incidence, types of HOCI identification surveillance systems, and level of system implementation were extracted. A total of 292 citations were identified. Nine studies on HOCI surveillance were included. Six studies reported on the proportion of HOCI among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which ranged from 0 to 15.2%. Six studies provided HOCI case definitions. Standardized national definitions provided by the UK and US governments were identified. Four studies included healthcare workers in the surveillance. One study articulated a multimodal strategy of infection prevention and control practices including HOCI surveillance. All identified HOCI surveillance systems were implemented at institutional level, with eight studies focusing on all hospital inpatients and one study focusing on patients in the emergency department. Multiple types of surveillance were identified. Four studies reported automated surveillance, of which one included real-time analysis, and one included genomic data. Overall, the study quality was limited by the observational nature with short follow-up periods. In conclusion, HOCI case definitions and surveillance methods were developed pragmatically. Whilst standardized case definitions and surveillance systems are ideal for integration with existing routine surveillance activities and adoption in different settings, we acknowledged the difficulties in establishing such standards in the short-term.

AB  - COVID-19 led to significant and dynamic shifts in power relations within and between governments, teaching us how governments make health policies and how health crises affect government. We focus on centralization and decentralization within and between governments: within government, meaning the extent to which the head of government controls policy; and between governments, meaning the extent to which the central government pre-empts or controls local and regional government. Political science literature suggests that shifting patterns of centralization and decentralization can be explained by leading politicians' efforts to gain credit for popular actions and outcomes and deflect blame for unpopular ones. We test this hypothesis in two ways: by coding the Health Systems Response Monitor's data on government responses, and through case studies of the governance of COVID-19 in Austria, Czechia and France. We find that credit and blame do substantially explain the timing and direction of changes in centralization and decentralization. In the first wave, spring 2020, heads of government centralized and raised their profile in order to gain credit for decisive action, but they subsequently tried to decentralize in order to avoid blame for repeated restrictions on life or surges of infection. These findings should shape advice on governance for pandemic response

AB  - Background
Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors could alter mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but existing meta-analyses that combined crude and adjusted results may be confounded by the fact that comorbidities are more common in ARB/ACE inhibitor users.
Methods
We searched PubMed/MEDLINE/Embase for cohort studies and meta-analyses reporting mortality by preexisting ARB/ACE inhibitor treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Random effects meta-regression was used to compute pooled odds ratios for mortality adjusted for imbalance in age, sex, and prevalence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease between users and nonusers of ARBs/ACE inhibitors at the study level during data synthesis.
Results
In 30 included studies of 17,281 patients, 22%, 68%, 25%, and 11% had cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. ARB/ACE inhibitor use was associated with significantly lower mortality after controlling for potential confounding factors (odds ratio 0.77 [95% confidence interval: 0.62, 0.96]). In contrast, meta-analysis of ARB/ACE inhibitor use was not significantly associated with mortality when all studies were combined with no adjustment made for confounders (0.87 [95% confidence interval: 0.71, 1.08]).
Conclusions
ARB/ACE inhibitor use was associated with decreased mortality in cohorts of COVID-19 patients after adjusting for age, sex, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Unadjusted meta-analyses may not be appropriate for determining whether ARBs/ACE inhibitors are associated with mortality from COVID-19 because of indication bias.
Résumé
Introduction
Les antagonistes des récepteurs de l'angiotensine (ARA) et/ou les inhibiteurs de l'enzyme de conversion de l'angiotensine (IECA) feraient varier la mortalité liée à la COVID-19, mais il est possible que les méta-analyses actuelles qui combinaient les résultats bruts et ajustés soient invalidées du fait que les comorbidités sont plus fréquentes chez les utilisateurs d'ARA/IECA.
Méthodes
Nous avons effectué des recherches dans les bases de données PubMed/MEDLINE/Embase pour trouver des études de cohorte et des méta-analyses qui portent sur la mortalité associée à un traitement préexistant par ARA/IECA chez les patients hospitalisés atteints de la COVID-19. Nous avons utilisé la métarégression à effets aléatoires pour calculer les rapports de cotes regroupés de mortalité ajustés en fonction du déséquilibre de l’âge, du sexe, et de la prévalence des maladies cardiovasculaires, de l'hypertension, du diabète sucré et de l'insuffisance rénale chronique entre les utilisateurs et les non-utilisateurs d'ARA/IECA dans le cadre de l’étude durant la synthèse des données.
Résultats
Dans les 30 études portant sur 17 281 patients, 22 %, 68 %, 25 % et 11 % avaient respectivement une maladie cardiovasculaire, de l'hypertension, le diabète sucré et de l'insuffisance rénale chronique. L'utilisation des ARA/IECA a été associée à une mortalité significativement plus faible après avoir tenu compte des facteurs confusionnels potentiels (rapport de cotes 0,77 [intervalle de confiance à 95 % : 0,62, 0,96]). En revanche, la méta-analyse sur l'utilisation des ARA/IECA n'a pas été associée de façon significative à la mortalité lorsque toutes les études ont été combinées sans ajustement sur les facteurs confusionnels (0,87 [intervalle de confiance à 95 % : 0,71, 1,08]).
Conclusions
L'utilisation des ARA/IECA a été associée à la diminution de la mortalité au sein des cohortes de patients atteints de la COVID-19 après l'ajustement en fonction de l’âge, du sexe, des maladies cardiovasculaires, de l'hypertension, du diabète et de l'insuffisance rénale chronique. Les méta-analyses non ajustées peuvent ne pas permettre de déterminer si les ARA/IECA sont associés à la mortalité liée à la COVID-19 en raison du biais d'indication.

AB  - The emergence of novel respiratory disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a public health emergency worldwide and perturbed the global economy and ecosystem services. Many studies have reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in different environmental compartments, its transmission via environmental routes, and potential environmental challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. None of these studies have comprehensively reviewed the bidirectional relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the environment. For the first time, we explored the relationship between the environment and the SARS-CoV-2 virus/COVID-19 and how they affect each other. Supporting evidence presented here clearly demonstrates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in soil and water, denoting the role of the environment in the COVID-19 transmission process. However, most studies fail to determine if the viral genomes they have discovered are infectious, which could be affected by the environmental factors in which they are found.The potential environmental impact of the pandemic, including water pollution, chemical contamination, increased generation of non-biodegradable waste, and single-use plastics have received the most attention. For the most part, efficient measures have been used to address the current environmental challenges from COVID-19, including using environmentally friendly disinfection technologies and employing measures to reduce the production of plastic wastes, such as the reuse and recycling of plastics. Developing sustainable solutions to counter the environmental challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic should be included in national preparedness strategies. In conclusion, combating the pandemic and accomplishing public health goals should be balanced with environmentally sustainable measures, as the two are closely intertwined.

AB  - COVID-19 is a multisystem disease and cause of a global pandemic. Lately, cases of disease progression of HPV-infected CIN under SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported giving rise to the hypothesis of direct virus-infection induced pro-carcinogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2. We herein present a case of rapid progression from HPV-induced CIN 2 to microinvasive carcinoma within three months under COVID-19 without direct virus infection. Histopathologic evaluation, Fluorescence-in-situ hybridization and qRT-PCR against SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as gene expression analysis were performed from the available FFPE-tissue and accompanied by an analysis of white blood cell differential. No signs of direct SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 typical alterations of cervical tissue were found. As expected, p53 decreased in expression with progression of dysplasia, while APOBEC3A and VISTA showed a decrease in expression contrary to observations in dysplasia progression. PD-L1 was expressed consistently or increased slightly but did not show the expected strong induction of expression. DNMT1 showed an increase in expression in CIN III and a slight decrease in carcinoma, while DNMT3a is consistently expressed in CIN II and decreased in carcinoma. Blood tests after COVID-19 showed substantial reduction of lymphocytes, eosinophils, T-cells, and NK-cells. Our results hint at an indirect effect of COVID-19 on the cervical neoplasm. We conclude that the immune system might be preoccupied and exhausted by the concurring COVID-19 disease, leading to less immunological pressure on the HPV-infected cervical dysplasia enabling rapid disease progression. Further, indirect proangiogenic and proinflammatory micromilieu due to the multisystemic effects of COVID-19 might play an additional role

AB  - Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the rapid development of a range of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) is a rare but life-threatening complication of primarily adenoviral-based vaccines associated with the presence of antibodies to a PF4/polyanion neoepitope and measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Presented are serial anti–PF4/polyanion antibody, platelet, and D-dimer measurements in a large cohort of patients and their relation to relapse. Overall, 51% of patients using the Stago assay had persistently positive anti–PF4/polyanion levels 100 days' postdiagnosis, whereas 94% of patients monitored by using the Immucor assay remain positive. The median duration of positivity of the PF4 assay is 87 days, with 72% of patients remaining positive after a median follow-up of 105 days. The use of plasma exchange seemed to reduce anti–PF4/polyanion levels and increase platelet counts in the acute setting more rapidly than other therapies. The rate of relapse in this study was 12.6%, with all relapsed cases exhibiting persistently positive PF4 antibodies and falling platelet counts. Only one patient had extension of their thrombosis. Overall, despite the persistence of PF4 antibodies in 72% of patients, the rate of relapse was low and did not seem to result in recrudescence of the aggressive clinical picture seen at index presentation. Monitoring of these patients in the UK cohort is ongoing and will aid in definition of the natural history of this novel condition.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has severely affected cancer care and research by disrupting the prevention and treatment paths as well as the preclinical, clinical, and translational research ecosystem. In Italy, this has been particularly significant given the severity of the pandemic’s impact and the intrinsic vulnerabilities of the national health system. However, whilst detrimental, disruption can also be constructive and may stimulate innovation and progress. The Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) has recognized the impact of COVID-19 on cancer care continuum and research and proposes the ‘2021 Matera statement’ which aims at providing pragmatic guidance for policymakers and health care institutions to mitigate the impact of the global health crisis on Italian oncology and design the recovery plan for the post-pandemic scenario. The interventions are addressed both to the pillars (prevention, diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, health care professionals) and foundations of cancer care (communication and care relationship, system organization, resources, research, networking). The priorities to be implemented can be summarized in the MATERA acronym: Multidisciplinarity; Access to cancer care; Telemedicine and Territoriality; Equity, ethics, education; Research and resources; Alliance between stakeholders and patients.

AB  - This paper develops a methodology for tracking in real-time the impact of shocks (such as natural disasters, financial crises or pandemics) on gross domestic product (GDP) by analyzing high-frequency electricity market data. As an illustration, we estimate the GDP loss caused by COVID-19 in twelve European countries during the first wave of the pandemic. Our results are almost indistinguishable from the official statistics during the first two quarters of 2020 (the correlation coefficient is 0.98) and are validated by several robustness tests. We provide estimates that are more chronologically disaggregated and up-to-date than standard macroeconomic indicators and, therefore, can provide timely information for policy evaluation in time of crisis. Our results show that pursuing “herd immunity” did not shelter from the harmful economic impacts of the first wave of the pandemic. They also suggest that coordinating policies internationally is fundamental for minimizing spillover effects from non-pharmaceutical interventions across countries.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 is associated with excessive inflammation, as a main reason for severe condition and death. Increased inflammatory cytokines and humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 correlate with COVID-19 immunity and pathogenesis. Importantly, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that increase profoundly in systemic circulation appear as part of the clinical pictures of two overlapping conditions, sepsis and the hemophagocytic syndromes. Both conditions can develop lethal inflammatory responses that lead to tissue damage, however, in many patients hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) can be differentiated from sepsis. This is a key issue because the life-saving aggressive immunosuppressive treatment, required in the HLH therapy, is absent in sepsis guidelines. This paper aims to describe the pathophysiology and clinical relevance of these distinct entities in the course of COVID-19 that resemble sepsis and further highlights two effector arms of the humoral immune response (inflammatory cytokine and immunoglobulin production) during COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a systemic disease that affects nearly all organ systems through infection and subsequent dysregulation of the vascular endothelium. One of the most striking phenomena has been a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)–associated coagulopathy. Given these findings, questions naturally emerged about the prothrombotic impact of COVID-19 on cerebrovascular disease and whether ischemic stroke is a clinical feature specific to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Early reports from China and several sites in the northeastern United States seemed to confirm these suspicions. Since these initial reports, many cohort studies worldwide observed decreased rates of stroke since the start of the pandemic, raising concerns for a broader impact of the pandemic on stroke treatment. In this review, we provide a comprehensive assessment of how the pandemic has affected stroke presentation, epidemiology, treatment, and outcomes to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on cerebrovascular disease. Much evidence suggests that this decline in stroke admissions stems from the global response to the virus, which has made it more difficult for patients to get to the hospital once symptoms start. However, there does not appear to be a demonstrable impact on quality metrics once patients arrive at the hospital. Despite initial concerns, there is insufficient evidence to ascribe a causal relationship specific to the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 on the cerebral vasculature. Nevertheless, when patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 present with stroke, their presentation is likely to be more severe, and they have a markedly higher rate of in-hospital mortality than patients with either acute ischemic stroke or COVID-19 alone.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has turned out to be a pandemic in short period of time due to the high transmissibility of its causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Various reports have suggested the promising link between overexpression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and COVID-19 pathogenesis. The severity of COVID-19 pathophysiology is greatly depended on several comorbidities, like hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), respiratory and cardiovascular disease, out of which DM has emerged as a major risk factor. The current review focuses on the link among the expression of ACE2, use of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), and risk of COVID-19 pathogenesis in DM. The review also emphasizes on synergistic detrimental effect of DM and COVID-19 on the immune system in provoking uncontrolled cytokine storm which eventually leads to lethal consequences. Finally, several possible therapeutic strategies have been highlighted to reduce the excess of risk associated with COVID-19 in people with DM.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and is associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. Various types of bacterial and fungal infections occur in patients with COVID-19 with some resistant to antimicrobials that are associated with significantly worse outcomes and deaths. Besides, antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) co-infections are responsible for clinically significant mortality in past pandemics. There is evidence to suggest that factors such as the proliferation of adulterated antimicrobials in some developing countries, international travels, issues with healthcare financing, use/misuse by humans, and in agricultural production and climate change are determinants of AMR at various levels of society. These complex interrelated determinants intersect with AMR in current and past pandemics and could amplify the potential of a future antimicrobial resistance pandemic. Therefore, global concerted interventions targeted at all levels of society to reduce the use/misuse of antimicrobials and disrupt these multifaceted, interrelated, and interdependent factors are urgently needed. This paper leverages prior research to describe complex major determinants of antimicrobial resistance and provides fresh insights into possible intervention strategies to tackle antimicrobial resistance including in the current and future pandemics.

AB  - The exposure-lag response of air temperature on daily COVID-19 incidence is unclear and there have been concerns regarding the robustness of previous studies. Here we present an analysis of high spatial and temporal resolution using the distributed lag non-linear modelling (DLNM) framework. Utilising nearly two years’ worth of data, we fit statistical models to twelve Italian cities to quantify the delayed effect of air temperature on daily COVID-19 incidence, accounting for several categories of potential confounders (meteorological, air quality and non-pharmaceutical interventions). Coefficients and covariance matrices for the temperature term were then synthesised using random effects meta-analysis to yield pooled estimates of the exposure-lag response with effects presented as the relative risk (RR) and cumulative RR (RRcum). The cumulative exposure response curve was non-linear, with peak risk at 15.1 °C and declining risk at progressively lower and higher temperatures. The lowest RRcum at 0.2 °C is 0.72 [0.56,0.91] times that of the highest risk. Due to this non-linearity, the shape of the lag response curve necessarily varied by temperature. This work suggests that on a given day, air temperature approximately 15 °C maximises the incidence of COVID-19, with the effects distributed in the subsequent ten days or more.

AB  - ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 is a global pandemic that is threatening the health and wellbeing of people worldwide. To date there have been more than 274 million reported cases and 5.3 million deaths. The Omicron variant first documented in the City of Tshwane, Gauteng Province, South Africa on 9 November 2021 led to exponential increases in cases and a sharp rise in hospital admissions. The clinical profile of patients admitted at a large hospital in Tshwane is compared with previous waves.
METHODS
466 hospital COVID-19 admissions since 14 November 2021 were compared to 3962 admissions since 4 May 2020, prior to the Omicron outbreak. Ninety-eight patient records at peak bed occupancy during the outbreak were reviewed for primary indication for admission, clinical severity, oxygen supplementation level, vaccination and prior COVID-19 infection. Provincial and city-wide daily cases and reported deaths, hospital admissions and excess deaths data were sourced from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, the National Department of Health and the South African Medical Research Council.
RESULTS
For the Omicron and previous waves, deaths and ICU admissions were 4.5% vs 21.3% (p<0.00001), and 1% vs 4.3% (p<0.00001) respectively; length of stay was 4.0 days vs 8.8 days; and mean age was 39 years vs 49,8 years. Admissions in the Omicron wave peaked and declined rapidly with peak bed occupancy at 51% of the highest previous peak during the Delta wave. Sixty two (63%) patients in COVID-19 wards had incidental COVID-19 following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test . Only one third (36) had COVID-19 pneumonia, of which 72% had mild to moderate disease. The remaining 28% required high care or ICU admission. Fewer than half (45%) of patients in COVID-19 wards required oxygen supplementation compared to 99.5% in the first wave. The death rate in the face of an exponential increase in cases during the Omicron wave at the city and provincial levels shows a decoupling of cases and deaths compared to previous waves, corroborating the clinical findings of decreased severity of disease seen in patients admitted to the Steve Biko Academic Hospital.
CONCLUSION
There was decreased severity of COVID-19 disease in the Omicron-driven fourth wave in the City of Tshwane, its first global epicentre.

AB  - Background
Gestational diabetes mellitus is one of the most frequent pregnancy complications with a global prevalence of 13.4% in 2021. Pregnant women with COVID-19 and gestational diabetes mellitus are 3.3 times more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit than women without gestational diabetes mellitus. Data on the association of gestational diabetes mellitus with maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection are lacking.
Objective
This study aimed to investigate whether gestational diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for adverse maternal and fetal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19.
Study Design
The COVID-19-Related Obstetric and Neonatal Outcome Study is a registry-based multicentric prospective observational study from Germany and Linz, Austria. Pregnant women with clinically confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled between April 3, 2020, and August 24, 2021, at any stage of pregnancy. Obstetricians and neonatologists of 115 hospitals actively provided data to the COVID-19-Related Obstetric and Neonatal Outcome Study. For collecting data, a cloud-based electronic data platform was developed. Women and neonates were observed until hospital discharge. Information on demographic characteristics, comorbidities, medical history, COVID-19–associated symptoms and treatments, pregnancy, and birth outcomes were entered by the local sites. Information on the periconceptional body mass index was collected. A primary combined maternal endpoint was defined as (1) admission to an intensive care unit (including maternal mortality), (2) viral pneumonia, and/or (3) oxygen supplementation. A primary combined fetal and neonatal endpoint was defined as (1) stillbirth at ≥24 0/7 weeks of gestation, (2) neonatal death ≤7 days after delivery, and/or (3) transfer to a neonatal intensive care unit. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the modulating effect of gestational diabetes mellitus on the defined endpoints.
Results
Of the 1490 women with COVID-19 (mean age, 31.0±5.2 years; 40.7% nulliparous), 140 (9.4%) were diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus; of these, 42.9% were treated with insulin. Overall, gestational diabetes mellitus was not associated with an adverse maternal outcome (odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.88–2.57). However, in women who were overweight or obese, gestational diabetes mellitus was independently associated with the primary maternal outcome (adjusted odds ratio, 2.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.43–5.07). Women who were overweight or obese with gestational diabetes mellitus requiring insulin treatment were found to have an increased risk of a severe course of COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio, 3.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–6.73). Adverse maternal outcomes were more common when COVID-19 was diagnosed with or shortly after gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosis than COVID-19 diagnosis before gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosis (19.6% vs 5.6%; P<.05). Maternal gestational diabetes mellitus and maternal preconception body mass index of ≥25 kg/m2 increased the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes (adjusted odds ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–3.18). Furthermore, overweight and obesity (irrespective of gestational diabetes mellitus status) were influential factors for the maternal (adjusted odds ratio, 1.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.26–2.75) and neonatal (adjusted odds ratio, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.32–2.48) primary endpoints compared with underweight or normal weight.
Conclusion
Gestational diabetes mellitus, combined with periconceptional overweight or obesity, was independently associated with a severe maternal course of COVID-19, especially when the mother required insulin and COVID-19 was diagnosed with or after gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosis. These combined factors exhibited a moderate effect on neonatal outcomes. Women with gestational diabetes mellitus and a body mass index of ≥25 kg/m2 were a particularly vulnerable group in the case of COVID-19.

AB  - The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has urged the establishment of a global-wide rapid diagnostic system. Current widely-used tests for COVID-19 include nucleic acid assays, immunoassays, and radiological imaging. Immunoassays play an irreplaceable role in rapidly diagnosing COVID-19 and monitoring the patients for the assessment of their severity, risks of the immune storm, and prediction of treatment outcomes. Despite of the enormous needs for immunoassays, the widespread use of traditional immunoassay platforms is still limited by high cost and low automation, which are currently not suitable for point-of-care tests (POCTs). Microfluidic chips with the features of low consumption, high throughput, and integration, provide the potential to enable immunoassays for POCTs, especially in remote areas. Meanwhile, luminescence detection can be merged with immunoassays on microfluidic platforms for their good performance in quantification, sensitivity, and specificity. This review introduces both homogenous and heterogenous luminescence immunoassays with various microfluidic platforms. We also summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the categorized methods, highlighting their recent typical progress. Additionally, different microfluidic platforms are described for comparison. The latest advances in combining luminescence immunoassays with microfluidic platforms for POCTs of COVID-19 are further explained with antigens, antibodies, and related cytokines. Finally, challenges and future perspectives were discussed.

AB  - One of the most significant threats to global health since the Second World War is the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to COVID-19 widespread social, environmental, economic, and health concerns. Other unfavourable factors also emerged, including increased trash brought on by high consumption of packaged foods, takeout meals, packaging from online shopping, and the one-time use of plastic products. Due to labour shortages and residents staying at home during mandatory lockdowns, city municipal administrations' collection and recycling capacities have decreased, frequently damaging the environment (air, water, and soil) and ecological and human systems. The COVID-19 challenges are more pronounced in unofficial settlements of developing nations, particularly for developing nations of the world, as their fundamental necessities, such as air quality, water quality, trash collection, sanitation, and home security, are either non-existent or difficult to obtain. According to reports, during the pandemic's peak days (20 August 2021 (741 K cases), 8 million tonnes of plastic garbage were created globally, and 25 thousand tonnes of this waste found its way into the ocean. This thorough analysis attempts to assess the indirect effects of COVID-19 on the environment, human systems, and water quality that pose dangers to people and potential remedies. Strong national initiatives could facilitate international efforts to attain environmental sustainability goals. Significant policies should be formulated like good quality air, pollution reduction, waste management, better sanitation system, and personal hygiene. This review paper also elaborated that further investigations are needed to investigate the magnitude of impact and other related factors for enhancement of human understanding of ecosystem to manage the water, environment and human encounter problems during epidemics/pandemics in near future.

AB  - As mortality and morbidity from novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continue to mount worldwide, the scientific community as well as public health systems are under immense pressure to contain the pandemic as well as to develop effective medical countermeasures. Meanwhile, desperation has driven prescribers, researchers as well as administrators to recommend and try therapies supported by little or no reliable evidence. Recently, hydroxychloroquine-sulfate (HCQS) has got significant media and political attention for the treatment as well as prophylaxis of COVID-19 despite the lack of convincing and unequivocal data supporting its efficacy and safety in these patients. This has unfortunately, yet foreseeably led to several controversies and confusion among the medical fraternity, the patient community as well as the general public. Based on the available studies, many with high risk of bias, relatively small sample sizes, and abbreviated follow-ups, HCQS is unlikely to be of dramatic benefit in COVID-19 patients and yet has the potential to cause harm, particularly when used in combination with azithromycin or other medications in high risk individuals with comorbidities. Although definitive data from larger well-controlled randomized trials will be forthcoming in the future, and we may be able to identify specific patient subpopulations likely to benefit from hydroxychloroquine, till that time it will be prudent to prescribe it within investigational trial settings with close safety monitoring. Here we review the current evidence and developments related to the use of HCQS in COVID-19 patients and highlight the importance of risk-benefit assessment and rational use of HCQS during this devastating pandemic.

AB  - The recent coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has caused unprecedented turmoil and spurred fears that have profoundly changed the public's social and health behaviours, including the perception of food safety risks. One year after the pandemic and the global vaccination campaign, the public perception of food safety and the changes in their hygiene behaviour, health risks concerns, and trust were studied in Jordan, Lebanon, and Tunisia using a cross-sectional online survey. The results of 538 subjects showed a rise in the frequency of hygiene practices, notably in handwashing. Sixty-four percent of the participants were vaccinated, a proportion made up mainly of the Jordanians and Lebanese. For 66% and 64% of the two population groups, respectively, there were no longer trust concerns about COVID-19 health risks following vaccination, whereas the worries about getting COVID-19 persisted for others. Only 47% of participants trusted eating food prepared by vaccinated food handlers. A great majority of the Tunisians (81%) showed varying degrees of concern about COVID-19 transmission from food and the lowest vaccination rate (33%). The current study demonstrated that the impact of vaccination policy positively affects public perception of food-related risks during the pandemic. On the other hand, 33% of the surveyed Jordanians and Tunisians lost trust in the health authorities' management of the pandemic, and 45% of the Lebanese still don't trust them. Communication strategies on health and food safety with the public still represent a challenge for these and probably other countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Strategies for building and maintaining public trust are crucial to curb persistent fear of food, hence, avoiding potential stigmatization affecting the food economy by promoting health awareness and positive changes in food safety perceptions for safer practices.

AB  - The post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) is characterized by the persistence of fluctuating symptoms over three months from the onset of the possible or confirmed COVID-19 acute phase. Current data suggests that at least 10% of people with previously documented infection may develop PACS, and up to 50–80% of prevalence is reported among survivors after hospital discharge. This viewpoint will discuss various aspects of PACS, particularly in older adults, with a specific hypothesis to describe PACS as the expression of a modified aging trajectory induced by SARS CoV-2. This hypothesis will be argued from biological, clinical and public health view, addressing three main questions: (i) does SARS-CoV-2-induced alterations in aging trajectories play a role in PACS?; (ii) do people with PACS face immuno-metabolic derangements that lead to increased susceptibility to age-related diseases?; (iii) is it possible to restore the healthy aging trajectory followed by the individual before pre-COVID?. A particular focus will be given to the well-being of people with PACS that could be assessed by the intrinsic capacity model and support the definition of the healthy aging trajectory.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a global upheaval in our health care system. Our hospital facilities have been subjected to a major influx of patients and the prevention of cross-contamination has been a key issue in the spread of the virus. New recommendations for good hygiene practice and new recommendations for disease management have emerged to limit the spread of the virus and reorganize the provision of care in key services. Many studies have attempted to identify factors that contribute to poor prognosis for COVID-19 infection. Among them, cancer patients, were considered more at risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19. In this article, we provide an overview of the current state of the pandemic as well as new recommendations for disease management that have emerged in oncology and radiation therapy in particular. In this article, we will try to provide some answers through a review of the literature to the question: is cancer a prognostic factor for severe COVID-19?
Résumé
La pandémie de la coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) est à l’origine d’un bouleversement mondial de notre système de santé. Nos structures hospitalières ont été soumises à une affluence majeure de patients et la prévention des contaminations croisées a constitué un enjeu déterminant dans la propagation du virus. Ainsi, de nouvelles recommandations de bonne pratique d’hygiène, ainsi que de nouvelles recommandations de prise en charge des pathologies, ont émergé afin de limiter la propagation du virus et réorganiser l’offre de soins dans les services déterminants. De nombreux travaux ont essayé de mettre en évidence des facteurs de pronostic défavorable de l’infection par le severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Parmi eux, les patients, atteints de cancer, ont été considérés comme plus à risque de voir se développer des formes sévères de la COVID-19. Dans cet article, nous dressons un état des lieux actuels de la pandémie, ainsi que des nouvelles recommandations de prise en charge ayant émergé en oncologie et, plus particulièrement, en radiothérapie. Nous essayerons d’apporter des éléments de réponse à travers une revue de la littérature à la question : le cancer constitue-t-il un facteur de risque de pronostic défavorable en cas d’infection par le SARS-CoV-2 ?

AB  - Summary
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most approved COVID-19 vaccines generate a neutralizing antibody response that primarily targets the highly variable receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. SARS-CoV-2 “variants of concern” have acquired mutations in this domain allowing them to evade vaccine-induced humoral immunity. Recent approaches to improve the breadth of protection beyond SARS-CoV-2 have required the use of mixtures of RBD antigens from different sarbecoviruses. It may therefore be beneficial to develop a vaccine in which the protective immune response targets a more conserved region of the S protein.
Methods
Here we have developed a vaccine based on the conserved S2 subunit of the S protein and optimized the adjuvant and immunization regimen in Syrian hamsters and BALB/c mice. We have characterized the efficacy of the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 variants and other coronaviruses.
Findings
Immunization with S2-based constructs elicited a broadly cross-reactive IgG antibody response that recognized the spike proteins of not only SARS-CoV-2 variants, but also SARS-CoV-1, and the four endemic human coronaviruses. Importantly, immunization reduced virus titers in respiratory tissues in vaccinated animals challenged with SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.351 (beta), B.1.617.2 (delta), and BA.1 (omicron) as well as a pangolin coronavirus.
Interpretation
These results suggest that S2-based constructs can elicit a broadly cross-reactive antibody response resulting in limited virus replication, thus providing a framework for designing vaccines that elicit broad protection against coronaviruses.

AB  - This analysis, using data from the Brazilian kidney transplant (KT) COVID-19 study, seeks to develop a prediction score to assist in COVID-19 risk stratification in KT recipients. In this study, 1379 patients (35 sites) were enrolled, and a machine learning approach was used to fit models in a derivation cohort. A reduced Elastic Net model was selected, and the accuracy to predict the 28-day fatality after the COVID-19 diagnosis, assessed by the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), was confirmed in a validation cohort. The better calibration values were used to build the applicable ImAgeS score. The 28-day fatality rate was 17% (n = 235), which was associated with increasing age, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, higher body mass index, dyspnea, and use of mycophenolate acid or azathioprine. Higher kidney graft function, longer time of symptoms until COVID-19 diagnosis, presence of anosmia or coryza, and use of mTOR inhibitor were associated with reduced risk of death. The coefficients of the best model were used to build the predictive score, which achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.767 (95% CI 0.698–0.834) in the validation cohort. In conclusion, the easily applicable predictive model could assist health care practitioners in identifying non-hospitalized kidney transplant patients that may require more intensive monitoring.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exploded onto the world stage in early 2020. The impact on solid organ transplantation (SOT) has been profound affecting potential donors, candidates, and recipients. Importantly, decreased donations and the pressure of limited resources placed on health care by the pandemic also disrupted transplant systems. We address the impact of COVID-19 on organ transplantation globally and review current understanding of the epidemiology, outcomes, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 in SOT recipients.

AB  - Purpose
There is growing evidence regarding the imaging findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in lung ultrasound (LUS), however the use of a combined prognostic and triage tool has yet to be explored. To determine the impact of the LUS in the prediction of the mortality of patients with highly suspected or confirmed COVID-19.The secondary outcome was to calculate a score with LUS findings with other variables to predict hospital admission and emergency department (ED) discharge.
Material and methods
Prospective study performed in the ED of three academic hospitals. Patients with highly suspected or confirmed COVID-19 underwent a LUS examination and laboratory tests.
Results
A total of 228 patients were enrolled between March and September 2020. The mean age was 61.9 years (Standard Deviation – SD 21.1). The most common findings in LUS was a right posteroinferior isolated irregular pleural line (53.9%, 123 patients). A logistic regression model was calculated, including age over 70 years, C-reactive protein (CRP) over 70mg/L and a lung score over 7 to predict mortality, hospital admission and discharge from the ED. We obtained a predictive model with a sensitivity of 56.8% and a specificity of 87.6%, with an AUC of 0.813 [p<0.001].
Conclusions
The combination of LUS, clinical and laboratory findings in this easy to apply “rule of 7” showed excellent performance to predict hospital admission and mortality.
Resumen
Objetivo
Existe una evidencia creciente con respecto a los hallazgos de imagen de la enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) en la ecografía pulmonar (LUS), sin embargo, aún no se ha explorado el uso de una herramienta combinada de pronóstico y triaje. El objetivo principal de este estudio fue determinar el impacto de la LUS en la predicción de la mortalidad de los pacientes con sospecha de afectación pulmonar por COVID-19. El objetivo secundario fue calcular una puntuación con los hallazgos del LUS con otras variables para predecir el ingreso hospitalario y el alta del servicio de urgencias (SU).
Material y métodos
Estudio prospectivo realizado en urgencias de tres hospitales académicos, en pacientes con sospecha de COVID-19 o confirmación de esta, a los que se sometió a un examen de LUS y pruebas de laboratorio.
Resultados
Se inscribieron un total de 228 pacientes entre marzo y septiembre de 2020. La edad media fue de 61,9 años (DE 21,1). El hallazgo más común en la LUS fue la irregularidad pleural posteroinferior derecha (53,9%, 123 pacientes). Se calculó un modelo de regresión logística, que incluyó la edad mayor de 70 años, proteína C reactiva (PCR) mayor de 70 mg/L y puntuación de afectación pulmonar mediante LUS score superior a 7 para predecir la mortalidad, el ingreso hospitalario y el alta del SU. Se obtuvo una sensibilidad del 56,8% y una especificidad del 87,6%, con un AUC de 0,813 [p < 0,001] para dicho modelo predictivo, en materia de mortalidad.
Conclusiones
La combinación de LUS, hallazgos clínicos y de laboratorio en esta «regla de 7» de fácil aplicación se mostró de utilidad para predecir el ingreso hospitalario y la mortalidad.

AB  - Older adults faced significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic but also demonstrated great resilience. Investigating these strengths may enhance and inform strategies to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. To gain insight into the resilience processes of older adults during the first year of the pandemic, we conducted a photovoice study with 26 older adults (aged over 60) in the province of Quebec, Canada. Participants met online weekly for three weeks in small groups to discuss their photographs and share their resilience strategies. The thematic analysis revealed three interrelated themes. First, participants distanced themselves from the pandemic by engaging in activities that took their focus away from COVID-19 and that afforded much-needed respite. Second, participants regained their bearings by reorganizing their schedules and establishing new routines that bolstered occupation rather than rumination. Third, participants used the pandemic to self-reflect and revise their priorities, leveraging the pandemic as an opportunity for growth. Together, these themes demonstrate the strengths, coping strategies and resilience of older adults and contrast the stereotypes of older adults as vulnerable and resourceless. These findings have the potential to inform the implementation of strength-based health promotion initiatives to mitigate the harms of the pandemic.

AB  - According to WHO the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic is yet to come. Despite of the exceptional measures being undertaken by regulatory agencies to expedite vaccine development, we may be several months if not years away from an effective vaccine. In such unprecedented times, the only resort nations have at their disposal is to identify and repurpose existing drugs against COVID-19 based on their known clinical or pharmacological profile which can provide direct or corroborative evidence of favorable benefit: risk in the management of COVID-19. Immune-mediated inflammation remains the hallmark of severe complications related to COVID-19 and while corticosteroids have shown preliminary evidence of benefit, they can act like a double-edged sword for majority of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, there is a need to identify ‘non-steroid’ potent and safe anti-inflammatory agents for use in therapeutic armamentarium against COVID-19. This article makes a case for one such existing drug, roflumilast, that can emerge as a steroid-sparing alternative against COVID-19.

AB  - The extent to which power, resources, and responsibilities for public health are centralized or decentralized within a jurisdiction and how public health functions are integrated or coordinated with health care services may shape pandemic responses. However, little is known about the impacts of centralization and integration on public health system responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We examine how public health leaders perceive centralization and integration facilitated and impeded effective COVID-19 responses in three Canadian provinces. We conducted a comparative case study involving semi-structured interviews with 58 public health system leaders in three Canadian provinces with varying degrees of centralization and integration. Greater public health system centralization and integration was seen by public health leaders to facilitate more rapidly initiated and well-coordinated provincial COVID-19 responses. Decentralization may have enabled locally tailored responses in the context of limited provincial leadership. Opacity in provincial decision-making processes, jurisdictional ambiguity impacting Indigenous communities, and ineffectual public health investments were impediments across jurisdictions and thus appear to be less impacted by centralization and integration. Our study generates novel insights about potential structural facilitators and impediments of effective COVID-19 pandemic responses during the second year of the pandemic. Findings highlight key areas for future research to inform system design that support leaders to manage large-scale public health emergencies.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with a declining volume of patients seen in the emergency department. Despite the need for seeking urgent care for conditions such as myocardial infarction, many people may not seek treatment. This study seeks to measure associations between the COVID-19 pandemic and location of death among individuals who died from ischemic heart disease (IHD). Data obtained from death certificates from the Arkansas Department of Health was used to conduct a difference-in-difference analysis to assess whether decedents of IHD were more likely to die at home during the pandemic (March 2020 through September 2020). The analysis compared location of death for decedents of IHD pre and during the pandemic to location of death for decedents from non-natural causes. Before the pandemic, 50.0% of decedents of IHD died at home compared to 57.9% dying at home during (through September 2020) the pandemic study period (p < .001). There was no difference in the proportion of decedents who died at home from non-natural causes before and during the pandemic study period (55.8% vs. 53.5%; p = .21). After controlling for confounders, there was a 48% increase in the odds of dying at home from IHD during the pandemic study period (p < .001) relative to the change in dying at home due to non-natural causes. During the study period, there was an increase in the proportion of decedents who died at home due to IHD. Despite the ongoing pandemic, practitioners should emphasize the need to seek urgent care during an emergency.

AB  - Summary
Background
COVID-19 has affected the African region in many ways. We aimed to generate robust information on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in this region since the beginning of the pandemic and throughout 2022.
Methods
For each of the 47 countries of the WHO African region, we consolidated COVID-19 data from reported infections and deaths (from WHO statistics); published literature on socioecological, biophysical, and public health interventions; and immunity status and variants of concern, to build a dynamic and comprehensive picture of COVID-19 burden. The model is consolidated through a partially observed Markov decision process, with a Fourier series to produce observed patterns over time based on the SEIRD (denoting susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, and dead) modelling framework. The model was set up to run weekly, by country, from the date the first infection was reported in each country until Dec 31, 2021. New variants were introduced into the model based on sequenced data reported by countries. The models were then extrapolated until the end of 2022 and included three scenarios based on possible new variants with varying transmissibility, severity, or immunogenicity.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 2020, and Dec 31, 2021, our model estimates the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the African region to be 505·6 million (95% CI 476·0–536·2), inferring that only 1·4% (one in 71) of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the region were reported. Deaths are estimated at 439 500 (95% CI 344 374–574 785), with 35·3% (one in three) of these reported as COVID-19-related deaths. Although the number of infections were similar between 2020 and 2021, 81% of the deaths were in 2021. 52·3% (95% CI 43·5–95·2) of the region's population is estimated to have some SARS-CoV-2 immunity, given vaccination coverage of 14·7% as of Dec 31, 2021. By the end of 2022, we estimate that infections will remain high, at around 166·2 million (95% CI 157·5–174·9) infections, but deaths will substantially reduce to 22 563 (14 970–38 831).
Interpretation
The African region is estimated to have had a similar number of COVID-19 infections to that of the rest of the world, but with fewer deaths. Our model suggests that the current approach to SARS-CoV-2 testing is missing most infections. These results are consistent with findings from representative seroprevalence studies. There is, therefore, a need for surveillance of hospitalisations, comorbidities, and the emergence of new variants of concern, and scale-up of representative seroprevalence studies, as core response strategies.

AB  - In the response to COVID-19, countries have implemented response strategies along a continuum of population- and venue-level specificity ranging from suppression to mitigation strategies. Suppression strategies generally include population-wide shelter-in-place mandates or lockdowns, closure of nonessential physical venues, travel bans, testing and contact tracing, and quarantines. Sweden followed a mitigation strategy focused on risk-tailored approaches to mitigate specific acquisition risks among the elderly, minimizing the disruption to education and the delivery of other health care services, and recommendations for social distancing to minimize the disease burden. To date, Sweden has reported higher case counts and attributable mortality than other Scandinavian countries and lower than other Northern European countries. However, there are several limitations with comparison given heterogeneity in testing strategies, suspected and confirmed case definitions, and assessment of attributable mortality. The decisions in Sweden also reflect social priorities such as equity being a foundational principle of Swedish social systems. Consistently, in-person education for those aged less than 16 years continued throughout. Notably, the mitigation strategy did not eliminate the inequitable impacts of COVID-19 cases and mortality in Sweden with higher-exposure and generally lower-income occupations being associated with higher risks intersecting with these communities often residing in more dense multigenerational households. From January 1 to November 15, there has been a 1.8% increase in all-cause mortality in 2020 compared with the average of 2015-2019, representing an excess of 14.3 deaths per 100,000 population. However, the final assessment of excess deaths in Sweden in 2020 including stratification by age and integration of secular trends can only be calculated in the coming years. In response to increasing cases in the fall of 2020, Sweden has continued to leverage business-oriented regulations and public-oriented guidelines for social distancing rather than police-enforced mandates. Ultimately, pandemics present no winners. Countries have implemented a range of different COVID-19 prevention and mitigation strategies responsive to their own priorities and legal systems including equity and the balancing of competing health priorities. Given these varied approaches, countries that pursued elimination, suppression, or mitigation strategies can collaboratively learn from both successes and challenges of the different strategies to inform COVID-19 and future pandemic responses.

AB  - Abstract
Given advanced age, comorbidities, and immune dysfunction, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients may be at particularly high risk of infection and poor outcomes related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Robust analysis of outcomes for CLL patients, particularly examining effects of baseline characteristics and CLL-directed therapy, is critical to optimally manage CLL patients through this evolving pandemic. CLL patients diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19 across 43 international centers (n = 198) were included. Hospital admission occurred in 90%. Median age at COVID-19 diagnosis was 70.5 years. Median Cumulative Illness Rating Scale score was 8 (range, 4-32). Thirty-nine percent were treatment naive (“watch and wait”), while 61% had received ≥1 CLL-directed therapy (median, 2; range, 1-8). Ninety patients (45%) were receiving active CLL therapy at COVID-19 diagnosis, most commonly Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi's; n = 68/90 [76%]). At a median follow-up of 16 days, the overall case fatality rate was 33%, though 25% remain admitted. Watch-and-wait and treated cohorts had similar rates of admission (89% vs 90%), intensive care unit admission (35% vs 36%), intubation (33% vs 25%), and mortality (37% vs 32%). CLL-directed treatment with BTKi's at COVID-19 diagnosis did not impact survival (case fatality rate, 34% vs 35%), though the BTKi was held during the COVID-19 course for most patients. These data suggest that the subgroup of CLL patients admitted with COVID-19, regardless of disease phase or treatment status, are at high risk of death. Future epidemiologic studies are needed to assess severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection risk, these data should be validated independently, and randomized studies of BTKi's in COVID-19 are needed to provide definitive evidence of benefit.

AB  - We failed to adequately launch a gender transformative response to COVID-19 pandemic, data by sex on a variety of indicators for most countries are hard to find. Some symptoms reported as common of COVID-19 infection, are more prominent in men, while others are more prominent in women, one cannot with certainty exclude that some of the differences observed could be due to gender bias in the management of cases in health services. The gender implications of the pandemic reach wide and far. Inequalities can be further aggravated as sex and gender intersect with other axes of inequality. The SAGER guidelines exemplify an effort to improve reporting of sex and gender dimensions and encouraging researchers to integrate these aspects in the research design. these observations and emerging evidence about the persistent gender-blind approach to COVID-19 is a wake-up call to change course. National Gender Equality Institutions can be central in ensuring gender matters are considered in government responses. COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity to reverse the trend and take action to apply an intersectional feminist approach to global health that enables a just and equal world where everyone's health and wellbeing matter.
Resumen
No se ha conseguido dar una respuesta adecuadamente transformadora desde la perspectiva de género a la pandemia de la COVID-19. Los datos por sexo en una variedad de indicadores para la mayoría de los países son difíciles de encontrar. Algunos síntomas comunes de la infección por COVID-19, son más frecuentes en los hombres, mientras que otros lo son en las mujeres, no pudiendo excluir con certeza que algunas de las diferencias observadas se deban a un sesgo de género en el manejo de los casos en los servicios de salud. Las implicaciones de género de la pandemia son amplias y de gran alcance. Las desigualdades pueden agravarse aún más cuando el sexo y el género se cruzan con otros ejes de desigualdad. Las directrices del SAGER ejemplifican un esfuerzo por mejorar la información sobre las dimensiones de sexo y género y por animar a quienes investigan a integrar estos aspectos en el diseño de la investigación. Estas observaciones y las pruebas emergentes sobre el persistente enfoque ciego al género de la COVID-19 son una llamada de atención para cambiar de rumbo. Las instituciones nacionales de igualdad de género pueden ser fundamentales para garantizar que las cuestiones de género se consideren en las respuestas gubernamentales. La pandemia de la COVID-19 es una oportunidad para invertir la tendencia y tomar medidas para aplicar un enfoque feminista interseccional en la salud global que permita un mundo justo e igualitario donde la salud y el bienestar de todos y todas importen.

AB  - Objectives
During the pandemic, Switzerland avoided stringent lockdowns and provided funds to stabilize the economy. To assess whether and in what subgroups the pandemic impacted on depressive symptoms in this specific Swiss context, we derived depression trajectories over an extended pandemic period in a Swiss cohort and related them to individuals' sociodemographic characteristics.
Study design
This was a population-based cohort study.
Methods
The population-based COVCO-Basel cohort in North-Western Switzerland invited 112,848 adult residents of whom 12,724 participated at baseline. Between July 2020 and December 2021, 6396 participants answered to additional 18 monthly online questionnaires. Depression symptoms were repeatedly measured by the DASS-21 scale. Group-based Trajectory Models methods were applied to identify clusters of similar depression trajectories. Trajectory clusters were characterized descriptively and with a Multinomial response model.
Results
Three distinct trajectories were identified. The ‘Highly affected’ trajectory (13%) had a larger presence of younger and female participants with lower average income, higher levels of past depression, and living alone. A majority of individuals in the ‘Unaffected’ trajectory (52%) were of medium or high average income, older average age, without previous depression symptoms, and not living alone. The ‘Moderately affected’ trajectory (35%) had a composition intermediate between the two opposite ‘extreme’ trajectories.
Conclusions
This study is among few studies investigating depression trajectories up to the time when COVID-19 vaccination was readily available to the entire population. During these 18 months of the pandemic, depressive symptoms increased in a substantial percentage of participants. Economic support, high-quality health care system, and moderate containment measures did not sufficiently protect all population subgroups from adverse, potentially long-term psychological pandemic impacts.

AB  - With more than 5 million fatalities and close to 300 million reported cases, COVID-19 is the first documented pandemic due to a coronavirus that continues to be a major health challenge. Despite being rapid, uncontrollable, and highly infectious in its spread, it also created incentives for technology development and redefined public health needs and research agendas to fast-track innovations to be translated. Breakthroughs in computational biology peaked during the pandemic with renewed attention to making all cutting-edge technology deliver agents to combat the disease. The demand to develop effective treatments yielded surprising collaborations from previously segregated fields of science and technology. The long-standing pharmaceutical industry's aversion to repurposing existing drugs due to a lack of exponential financial gain was overrun by the health crisis and pressures created by front-line researchers and providers. Effective vaccine development even at an unprecedented pace took more than a year to develop and commence trials. Now the emergence of variants and waning protections during the booster shots is resulting in breakthrough infections that continue to strain health care systems. As of now, every protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been structurally characterized and related host pathways have been extensively mapped out. The research community has addressed the druggability of a multitude of possible targets. This has been made possible due to existing technology for virtual computer-assisted drug development as well as new tools and technologies such as artificial intelligence to deliver new leads. Here in this article, we are discussing advances in the drug discovery field related to target-based drug discovery and exploring the implications of known target-specific agents on COVID-19 therapeutic management. The current scenario calls for more personalized medicine efforts and stratifying patient populations early on for their need for different combinations of prognosis-specific therapeutics. We intend to highlight target hotspots and their potential agents, with the ultimate goal of using rational design of new therapeutics to not only end this pandemic but also uncover a generalizable platform for use in future pandemics.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 virus has attracted a lot of attention globally due to the autoimmune and inflammatory processes that were observed during the development of Covid-19 disease. Excessive activation of immune response and triggering of autoantibodies synthesis as well as an excessive synthesis of inflammatory cytokines and the onset of cytokine storm has a vital role in the disease outcome and the occurring autoimmune complications. This scenario is reminiscent of infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes in specific organs and the increased production of autoantibodies and chemoattractants noted in other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The main goal of this study is to investigate the complex inflammatory processes that occur in Covid-19 disease and to find similarities with other inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Kawasaki syndrome to advance existing diagnostic and therapeutic protocols. The therapy with Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and the use of S1P receptor modulators showed promising results. However, there are many unknowns about these mechanisms and possible novel therapies. Therefore, the inflammation and autoimmunity triggered by Covid-19 should be further investigated to improve existing diagnostic procedures and therapeutic protocols for Covid-19.

Currently, there is no formally accepted pharmacological treatment for COVID-19.
Materials and methods
We included COVID-19 outpatients of a Peruvian primary care center from Lima, Peru, who were treated between April 30 - September 30, 2020, with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Logistic regression was applied to determine factors associated with case-fatality rate.
Results
A total of 1265 COVID-19 patients with an average age of 44.5 years were studied. Women represented 50.1% of patients, with an overall 5.9 symptom days, SpO2 97%, temperature of 37.3 °C, 41% with at least one comorbidity and 96.1% one symptom or sign. No patient treated within the first 72 h of illness died. The factors associated with higher case fatality rate were age (OR = 1.06; 95% CI 1.01–1.11, p = 0.021), SpO2 (OR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.79–0.96, p = 0.005) and treatment onset (OR = 1.16; 95% CI 1.06–1.27, p = 0.002), being the latter the only associated in the multivariate analysis (OR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.05–1.32, p = 0.005). 0.6% of our patients died.
Conclusions
The case fatality rate in COVID-19 outpatients treated with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin was associated with the number of days of illness on which treatment was started.

AB  - Summary
Background
COVID-19 has overwhelmed health services globally. Oral antiviral therapies are licensed worldwide, but indications and efficacy rates vary. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral favipiravir in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.
Methods
We conducted a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial of oral favipiravir in adult patients who were newly admitted to hospital with proven or suspected COVID-19 across five sites in the UK (n=2), Brazil (n=2) and Mexico (n=1). Using a permuted block design, eligible and consenting participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral favipiravir (1800 mg twice daily for 1 day; 800 mg twice daily for 9 days) plus standard care, or standard care alone. All caregivers and patients were aware of allocation and those analysing data were aware of the treatment groups. The prespecified primary outcome was the time from randomisation to recovery, censored at 28 days, which was assessed using an intention-to-treat approach. Post-hoc analyses were used to assess the efficacy of favipiravir in patients aged younger than 60 years, and in patients aged 60 years and older. The trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04373733.
Findings
Between May 5, 2020 and May 26, 2021, we assessed 503 patients for eligibility, of whom 499 were randomly assigned to favipiravir and standard care (n=251) or standard care alone (n=248). There was no significant difference between those who received favipiravir and standard care, relative to those who received standard care alone in time to recovery in the overall study population (hazard ratio [HR] 1·06 [95% CI 0·89–1·27]; n=499; p=0·52). Post-hoc analyses showed a faster rate of recovery in patients younger than 60 years who received favipiravir and standard care versus those who had standard care alone (HR 1·35 [1·06–1·72]; n=247; p=0·01). 36 serious adverse events were observed in 27 (11%) of 251 patients administered favipiravir and standard care, and 33 events were observed in 27 (11%) of 248 patients receiving standard care alone, with infectious, respiratory, and cardiovascular events being the most numerous. There was no significant between-group difference in serious adverse events per patient (p=0·87).
Interpretation
Favipiravir does not improve clinical outcomes in all patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, however, patients younger than 60 years might have a beneficial clinical response. The indiscriminate use of favipiravir globally should be cautioned, and further high-quality studies of antiviral agents, and their potential treatment combinations, are warranted in COVID-19.

AB  - France is one of the most vaccine-hesitant countries in the world, including for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). After 10 months of restrictive measures and media coverage of the dangers of COVID-19, French attitudes towards a vaccine continue to deteriorate. The communication strategies of the government have not helped; in fact, they have made the situation worse. Empirical studies on the national strategy for management of the COVID-19 pandemic in France have shed light on the reasons for vaccine hesitancy. These studies have identified four pillars for the vaccination strategy: i) Communication regarding the importance of herd immunity, ii) making healthcare workers the focus of the vaccination campaign, iii) citizen mobilization and guaranteed consultations, and iv) access to free vaccines without delay. This paper discusses the evidence supporting this strategy.

AB  - Since the beginning of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) virus pandemic, several highly effective and safe vaccines have been produced at remarkable speed. Following global implementation of vaccination programmes, cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following administration of adenoviral vector-based vaccines started being reported. In this review we discuss the known pathogenesis and epidemiology of so-called vaccine induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT). We consider the available guidelines, diagnostic laboratory tests and management options for these patients. Finally, we discuss important unanswered questions and areas for future research in this novel pathoclinical entity.

AB  - The world is currently facing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic which places great pressure on health care systems and workers, often presents with severe clinical features, and sometimes requires admission into intensive care units. Derangements in nutritional status, both for obesity and malnutrition, are relevant for the clinical outcome in acute illness. Systemic inflammation, immune system impairment, sarcopenia, and preexisting associated conditions, such as respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases related to obesity, could act as crucial factors linking nutritional status and the course and outcome of COVID-19. Nevertheless, vitamins and trace elements play an essential role in modulating immune response and inflammatory status. Overall, evaluation of the patient's nutritional status is not negligible for its implications on susceptibility, course, severity, and responsiveness to therapies, in order to perform a tailored nutritional intervention as an integral part of the treatment of patients with COVID-19. The aim of this study was to review the current data on the relevance of nutritional status, including trace elements and vitamin status, in influencing the course and outcome of the disease 3 mo after the World Health Organization's declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic.

AB  - Favipiravir, a broad-spectrum RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, inhibits the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at significantly lower concentrations than the plasma trough levels achieved by the dosage adopted for influenza treatment and exhibits efficacy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Although high doses of favipiravir are required due to the molecule being a purine analog, its conversion into the active form in infected cells with active viral RNA synthesis enhances the antiviral specificity and selectivity as a chain terminator with lethal mutagenesis. Another characteristic feature is the lack of generation of favipiravir-resistant virus. COVID-19 pneumonia is caused by strong cell-mediated immunity against virus-infected cells, and the inflammatory response induced by adaptive immunity continues to peak for 3 to 5 days despite antiviral treatment. This has also been observed in herpes zoster (HZ) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia. Inflammation due to an immune response may mask the effectiveness of favipiravir against COVID-19 pneumonia. Favipiravir significantly shortened the recovery time in patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia by 3 days with the start of treatment by the 5th day of symptom onset. Since both CMV and COVID-19 pneumonia are caused by adaptive immunity and prevention of cytomegalovirus pneumonia is the standard treatment due to difficulties in treating refractory CMV pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia should be prevented with early treatment as well. In the present study, we have comprehensively reviewed the optimal antiviral therapy for COVID-19 based on clinical trials of favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia and the concurrently established therapies for other viral infections, particularly HZ and CMV pneumonia. Optimally, antivirals should be administered immediately after COVID-19 diagnosis, similar to that after influenza diagnosis, to prevent COVID-19 pneumonia and complications resulting from microangiopathy.

AB  - Viral infections are a continuing global burden on the human population, underscored by the ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Current treatment options and supportive therapies for many viral infections are relatively limited, indicating a need for alternative therapeutic approaches. Virus-induced damage occurs through direct infection of host cells and inflammation-related changes. Severe cases of certain viral infections, including COVID-19, can lead to a hyperinflammatory response termed cytokine storm, resulting in extensive endothelial damage, thrombosis, respiratory failure, and death. Therapies targeting these complications are crucial in addition to antiviral therapies. Nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide are two endogenous gasotransmitters that have emerged as key signaling molecules with a broad range of antiviral actions in addition to having anti-inflammatory properties and protective functions in the vasculature and respiratory system. The enhancement of endogenous nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide levels thus holds promise for managing both early-stage and later-stage viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a model for similar viral infections, here we explore the current evidence regarding nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide's use to limit viral infection, resolve inflammation, and reduce vascular and pulmonary damage.

AB  - Background and aims
Molnupiravir is a newer oral antiviral drug that has recently been tested in COVID-19. We aim to conduct a systematic review of literature to find out the efficacy and safety of molnupiravir in patients with COVID-19.
Methods
We systematically searched the electronic database of PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar from inception until October 15, 2021, using MeSH keywords. Ongoing trials of molnupiravir in COVID-19 were additionally searched from the ClinicalTrials.Gov and ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials. We retrieved all the available granular details of phase 1 to 3 studies of molnupiravir in COVID-19. Subsequently we reviewed the results narratively.
Results
Two phase 1 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled (DBRPC) studies of molnupiravir showed that 1600 mg daily dose is safe and tolerable, without any serious adverse events up to 5.5 days. One phase 2 DBPRC study found significantly lower time to clearance (RNA negativity) with molnupiravir 800 mg twice daily compared to the placebo (log-rank p value = 0.013) in mild to moderate COVID-19. Interim report of one phase 3 DBRPC study in non-hospitalized COVID-19 found a significant reduction in the risk of hospital admission or death by 50% (p = 0.0012). However, no significant benefit was observed with molnupiravir in the later stage of moderate to severe COVID-19.
Conclusion
Molnupiravir is first oral antiviral drug to demonstrate a significant benefit in reducing hospitalization or death in mild COVID-19 and could be an important weapon in the battle against SARS-CoV-2. However, its role in moderate to severe COVID-19 is questionable and more studies are needed.

AB  - Background
Health care personnel (HCP) have experienced significant SARS-CoV-2 risk, but exposure settings among HCP COVID-19 cases are poorly characterized.
Methods
We assessed exposure settings among HCP COVID-19 cases in the United States from March 2020 to March 2021 with reported exposures (n = 83,775) using national COVID-19 surveillance data. Exposure setting and reported community incidence temporal trends were described using breakpoint estimation. Among cases identified before initiation of COVID-19 vaccination programs (n = 65,650), we used separate multivariable regression models to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for associations of community incidence with health care and household and/or community exposures.
Results
Health care exposures were the most reported (52.0%), followed by household (30.8%) and community exposures (25.6%). Health care exposures and community COVID-19 incidence showed similar temporal trends. In adjusted analyses, HCP cases were more likely to report health care exposures (aPR = 1.31; 95% CI:1.26-1.36) and less likely to report household and/or community exposures (aPR = 0.73; 95% CI:0.70-0.76) under the highest vs lowest community incidence levels.
Discussion
These findings highlight HCP exposure setting temporal trends and workplace exposure hazards under high community incidence. Findings also underscore the need for robust collection of work-related data in infectious disease surveillance.
Conclusions
Many reported HCP cases experienced occupational COVID-19 exposures, particularly during periods of higher community COVID-19 incidence.

AB  - Obesity is a chronic disease that leads to an increased risk of mortality and morbidity, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may create a new health challenge. There is clear evidence showing that some biological and social factors associated with obesity involve an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and greater severity compared to people with normal weight. Undoubtedly, obesity involves a low-grade proinflammatory state that produces a dysregulation of the immune system that compromises its ability to respond to respiratory infection by COVID-19 and so produces a worsening of the disease. In this review, the main epidemiological and pathophysiological data that associate obesity with COVID-19 are described.
Resumen
La obesidad es una enfermedad crónica asociada a incremento de la morbimortalidad en el mundo, y el impacto con la pandemia de COVID-19 puede suponer un nuevo reto sanitario. Disponemos de evidencias que sugieren que algunos factores biológicos y sociales asociados con la obesidad confieren un mayor riesgo de infección por COVID-19, de hospitalización y de mayor gravedad respecto a las personas con normopeso. Sin duda, la obesidad comporta un estado proinflamatorio de bajo grado que produce una desregulación del sistema inmune que compromete su capacidad de respuesta ante la infección respiratoria por la COVID-19 y propicia un empeoramiento de la enfermedad. En esta revisión se exponen los principales datos epidemiológicos y fisiopatológicos que asocian obesidad con la COVID-19.

AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial morbidity and mortality to humanity. Remarkable progress has been made in understanding both the innate and adaptive mechanisms involved in the host response to the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus, but much remains to be discovered. Robust upper airway defenses are critical in restricting SARS-CoV-2 replication and propagation. Further, the nasal abundance of viral uptake receptor, ACE2, and the host epithelial transcriptional landscape, are associated with differential disease outcomes across different patient cohorts. The adaptive host response to systemic COVID-19 is heterogeneous and complex. Blunted responses to interferon and robust cytokine generation are hallmarks of the disease, particularly at the advanced stages. Excessive immune cell influx into tissues can lead to substantial collateral damage to the host akin to sepsis. This review offers a contemporary summary of these mechanisms of disease and highlights potential avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic development. These include improved disease stratification, targeting effectors of immune-mediated tissue damage, and blunting of immune cell-mediated tissue damage.

AB  - While COVID-19 is best known as a respiratory infection, SARS-CoV-2 causes systemic disease manifestations including coagulopathies. Both dysregulated extracellular matrix remodeling pathways and circulating coagulation proteins are hallmarks of severe COVID-19 and often continue after the resolution of acute infection. Coagulation proteins have proven effective as biomarkers for severe disease and anticoagulants are a mainstay of COVID-19 therapeutics in hospitalized patients. While much knowledge has been gained about the role of clotting pathway activation in COVID-19, much remains to be elucidated in this complex network of signaling pathways.

AB  - Summary
Background
A key unresolved controversy in severe COVID-19 pneumonitis in pregnancy is the optimum timing of delivery and whether delivery improves or worsens maternal outcomes. We aimed to assess clinical data on every intensive care unit (ICU) day for pregnant and postpartum women admitted to the ICU with COVID-19, with a particular focus on the days preceding and following delivery.
Methods
In this multicentre, nationwide, prospective and retrospective cohort study, we evaluated all pregnant women who were admitted to an ICU in Israel with severe COVID-19 pneumonitis from the 13th week of gestation to the 1st week postpartum. We excluded pregnant patients in which the ICU admission was unrelated to severe COVID-19 pneumonitis. We assessed maternal and neonatal outcomes and longitudinal clinical and laboratory ICU data. The primary overall outcome was maternal outcome (worst of the following: no invasive positive pressure ventilation [IPPV], use of IPPV, use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO], or death). The primary longitudinal outcome was Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and the secondary longitudinal outcome was the novel PORCH (positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP], oxygenation, respiratory support, chest x-ray, haemodynamic support) score. Patients were classified into four groups: no-delivery (pregnant at admission and no delivery during the ICU stay), postpartum (ICU admission ≥1 day after delivery), delivery-critical (pregnant at admission and receiving or at high risk of requiring IPPV at the time of delivery), or delivery-non-critical (pregnant at admission and not critically ill at the time of delivery).
Findings
From Feb 1, 2020, to Jan 31, 2022, 84 patients were analysed: 34 patients in the no-delivery group, four in postpartum, 32 in delivery-critical, and 14 in delivery-non-critical. The delivery-critical and postpartum groups had worse outcomes than the other groups: 26 (81%) of 32 patients in the delivery-critical group and four (100%) of four patients in the postpartum group required IPPV; 12 (38%) and three (75%) patients required ECMO, and one (3%) and two (50%) patients died, respectively. The delivery-non-critical and no-delivery groups had far better outcomes than other groups: six (18%) of 34 patients and two (14%) of 14 patients required IPPV, respectively; no patients required ECMO or died. Oxygen saturation (SpO2), SpO2 to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio (S/F ratio), partial pressure of arterial oxygen to FiO2 ratio (P/F ratio), ROX index (S/F ratio divided by respiratory rate), and SOFA and PORCH scores were all highly predictive for adverse maternal outcome (p<0·0001). The delivery-critical group deteriorated on the day of delivery, continued to deteriorate throughout the ICU stay, and took longer to recover (ICU duration, Mantel-Cox p<0·0001), whereas the delivery-non-critical group improved rapidly following delivery. The day of delivery was a significant covariate for PORCH (p<0·0001) but not SOFA (p=0·09) scores.
Interpretation
In patients who underwent delivery during their ICU stay, maternal outcome deteriorated following delivery among those defined as critical compared with non-critical patients, who improved following delivery. Interventional delivery should be considered for maternal indications before patients deteriorate and require mechanical ventilation.
Funding
None.

AB  - Purpose
Resuming joint replacement arthroplasty amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown has come with various challenges that had to be dealt with utmost caution. Patients with severe arthritis experiencing a state of intolerable pain, could not be left unaddressed. Guidelines published by surgical associations, collaborative surgical author groups including public health organisations had to be modified to suit the Indian scenario and obtain optimal functional outcomes in these patients.
Methods
A retrospective cohort analysis of 147 patients who underwent arthroplasty during the pandemic (March 2020 to April 2021), for either primary or secondary arthritis, was performed. We assess the efficacy and safety of the newly established Institutional surgical peri-operative protocol at our tertiary care centre in the National Capital Region, India in response to COVID-19 guidelines. The primary outcome measures appraised was 30-day mortality and the secondary outcome measures included length of stay, peri-operative complications and COVID-19 infection.
Result
The most common indication for arthroplasty during the pandemic was neglected trauma. One patient died, due to myocardial infarction during the follow-up period. About 67% of patients were discharged to their usual residence within 7 days of admission. Two patients tested positive for COVID-19 postoperatively, but none required Intensive Care Unit admission.
Conclusion
Joint replacement arthroplasty can be undertaken safely with diligent patient selection, application of a stringent COVID appropriate behaviour and a ‘ring-fenced’ peri-operative pathway.

AB  - Ten months into the Covid-19 pandemic it remains unclear whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is affected by climate factors. Using a dynamic epidemiological model with Covid-19 climate sensitivity in the likely range, we demonstrate why attempts to detect a climate signal in Covid-19 have thus far been inconclusive. Then we formulate a novel methodology based on susceptible-infected time trajectories that can be used to test for seasonal climate sensitivity in observed Covid-19 infection data. We show that if the disease does have a substantial seasonal dependence, and herd immunity is not established during the first peak season of the outbreak (or a vaccine does not become available), there is likely to be a seasonality-sensitive second wave of infections about one year after the initial outbreak. In regions where non-pharmaceutical control has contained the disease in the first year of outbreak and thus kept a large portion of the population susceptible, the second wave may be substantially larger in amplitude than the first if control measures are relaxed. This is simply because it develops under the favorable conditions of a full autumn to winter period and from a larger pool of infected individuals.

Operational Research – the ubiquitous ‘science of better’ – plays a vital role in supporting this decision-making process. To that end, using data from the USA, India, UK, Germany, and Singapore up to mid-April 2020, we provide predictive analytics tools for forecasting and planning during a pandemic. We forecast COVID-19 growth rates with statistical, epidemiological, machine- and deep-learning models, and a new hybrid forecasting method based on nearest neighbors and clustering. We further model and forecast the excess demand for products and services during the pandemic using auxiliary data (google trends) and simulating governmental decisions (lockdown). Our empirical results can immediately help policymakers and planners make better decisions during the ongoing and future pandemics.

AB  - COVID-19 led to sudden changes in human activities, mainly due to restrictive measures required to supress the virus. We assess the preliminary evidence for impacts on animal health and welfare in Scottish aquaculture, a key economic activity in remoter areas of the country. We summarise the industry structure, explore pathways of vulnerability to aquatic animal disease within a One Health framework that may be accentuated by impacts of COVID-19, and use basic routine data collection on the key welfare indicators of salmon mortality and parasitic sea lice counts. The indicators were published on schedule and provide no evidence of gross impact on health and welfare, at least for salmon, during the period of intensive lockdown restrictions in Scotland. Longer term effects cannot be ruled out and we do not assess impacts on the economic or social aspects of aquaculture production.

AB  - Convalescent plasma has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has received emergency use authorization, and is being widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Passive antibody therapy via plasma or serum has been successfully used to treat infectious diseases for more than a century. Passive antibody administration is based on the presumption that convalescent plasma or serum contains therapeutic antibodies that can be passively transferred to the plasma recipient. There are numerous examples in which convalescent plasma has been used successfully as post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment of infectious diseases, including previous coronavirus outbreaks. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, convalescent plasma was demonstrated to be safe and potentially effective among patients infected with COVID-19. This review provides an overview of the historical uses of convalescent plasma therapy, summarizes current evidence for convalescent plasma use for COVID-19, and highlights future antibody therapies.

AB  - COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes acute respiratory syndrome, is a contagious and deadly disease that has devastating effects on society and human life. COVID-19 can cause serious complications, especially in patients with pre-existing chronic health problems such as diabetes, hypertension, lung cancer, weakened immune systems, and the elderly. The most critical step in the fight against COVID-19 is the rapid diagnosis of infected patients. Computed Tomography (CT), chest X-ray (CXR), and RT-PCR diagnostic kits are frequently used to diagnose the disease. However, due to difficulties such as the inadequacy of RT-PCR test kits and false negative (FN) results in the early stages of the disease, the time-consuming examination of medical images obtained from CT and CXR imaging techniques by specialists/doctors, and the increasing workload on specialists, it is challenging to detect COVID-19. Therefore, researchers have suggested searching for new methods in COVID- 19 detection. In analysis studies with CT and CXR radiography images, it was determined that COVID-19-infected patients experienced abnormalities related to COVID-19. The anomalies observed here are the primary motivation for artificial intelligence researchers to develop COVID-19 detection applications with deep convolutional neural networks. Here, convolutional neural network-based deep learning algorithms from artificial intelligence technologies with high discrimination capabilities can be considered as an alternative approach in the disease detection process. This study proposes a deep convolutional neural network, COVID-DSNet, to diagnose typical pneumonia (bacterial, viral) and COVID-19 diseases from CT, CXR, hybrid CT + CXR images. In the multi-classification study with the CT dataset, 97.60 % accuracy and 97.60 % sensitivity values were obtained from the COVID-DSNet model, and 100 %, 96.30 %, and 96.58 % sensitivity values were obtained in the detection of typical, common pneumonia and COVID-19, respectively. The proposed model is an economical, practical deep learning network that data scientists can benefit from and develop. Although it is not a definitive solution in disease diagnosis, it may help experts as it produces successful results in detecting pneumonia and COVID-19.

AB  - Background
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognizes that older adults and individuals with certain medical conditions are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Understanding the proportion of the population at risk of severe infection, including among those with heart disease, could assist current vaccine strategy efforts.
Methods
Using data from the 2015-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we estimated the weighted prevalence of any of eight of eleven increased-risk conditions (including age ≥65) in U.S. adults aged ≥18 (N = 10,581) and extrapolated these results to a population of 233.8 million U.S. adults ≥18, and subgroups from the overall population defined by race/ethnicity, education, income and history of heart disease.
Results
An estimated 176.1 million individuals representing 75.4% of U.S. adults had at least one increased-risk condition, 40.3% ≥2 and, 18.5% ≥3 conditions. Approximately 129 million adults aged <65 (69.2%) were also estimated to be at increased-risk. Compared to Whites, similar proportions of Blacks in the overall population (78.0 vs. 75.6%, p>0.05) and Hispanics in the younger population (70.8 vs 68.4%) were estimated to be at increased-risk. Conversely, a greater proportion of individuals with lower education and income levels were estimated to be at increased-risk both in the overall and younger population. In addition, an estimated 6.2 million individuals (14.5%) had heart disease. Among these, virtually all had at least one additional CDC risk factor (97.9%) and most had ≥2 or ≥3 risk factors (83.8% and 58.5%, respectively).
Conclusions
As vaccination strategies are being explored, these results demonstrate that >75% of adults in the U.S. would be considered at increased-risk for severe COVID-19 infection by CDC criteria. Risk factor prevalence alone may not adequately capture the totality of risk, particularly among Black and Hispanic racial/ethnic groups and those with heart disease.

AB  - This study compared disease progression of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in three different models of golden hamsters: aged (≈60 weeks old) wild-type (WT), young (6 weeks old) WT, and adult (14–22 weeks old) hamsters expressing the human-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. After intranasal (IN) exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 Washington isolate (WA01/2020), 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) was used to monitor disease progression in near real time and animals were euthanized at pre-determined time points to directly compare imaging findings with other disease parameters associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Consistent with histopathology, 18F-FDG-PET/CT demonstrated that aged WT hamsters exposed to 105 plaque forming units (PFU) developed more severe and protracted pneumonia than young WT hamsters exposed to the same (or lower) dose or hACE2 hamsters exposed to a uniformly lethal dose of virus. Specifically, aged WT hamsters presented with a severe interstitial pneumonia through 8 d post-exposure (PE), while pulmonary regeneration was observed in young WT hamsters at that time. hACE2 hamsters exposed to 100 or 10 PFU virus presented with a minimal to mild hemorrhagic pneumonia but succumbed to SARS-CoV-2-related meningoencephalitis by 6 d PE, suggesting that this model might allow assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the central nervous system (CNS). Our group is the first to use (18F-FDG) PET/CT to differentiate respiratory disease severity ranging from mild to severe in three COVID-19 hamster models. The non-invasive, serial measure of disease progression provided by PET/CT makes it a valuable tool for animal model characterization.
