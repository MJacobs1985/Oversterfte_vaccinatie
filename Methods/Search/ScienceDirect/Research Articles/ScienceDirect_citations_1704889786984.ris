AB  - Black Americans have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 but have comparatively low vaccination rates, creating a need for vaccine messaging strategies that are tailored to this population. We conducted an experimental study to examine the effects of three messaging strategies on Black Americans’ reported willingness to receive the vaccine and vaccine hesitancy. We also recruited White and Hispanic Americans to assess any potential backfire effects of the tailored strategies for non-Black participants. A total of 739 participants completed the study. Results from 4x2 ANCOVAs indicate that, among Black participants, messaging that acknowledged past unethical treatment of Black Americans in medical research and emphasized current safeguards to prevent medical mistreatment was associated with significantly less vaccine hesitancy than the control condition. The same effects were not observed for messaging strategies that provided general safety information about the vaccine or that emphasized the role of the vaccine in reducing racial inequities. There were no significant differences across conditions for participants of other races. Results demonstrate that public health messages tailored to address specific vaccine concerns may aid future vaccination campaigns.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased risk of baseline mortality and severe COVID-19, but analyses across CKD stages, and comorbidities are lacking. In prevalent and incident CKD, we investigated comorbidities, baseline risk, COVID-19 incidence, and predicted versus observed one-year excess death. In a national dataset (NHS Digital Trusted Research Environment [NHSD TRE]) for England encompassing 56 million individuals), we conducted a retrospective cohort study (March 2020 to March 2021) for prevalence of comorbidities by incident and prevalent CKD, SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality. Baseline mortality risk, incidence and outcome of infection by comorbidities, controlling for age, sex and vaccination were assessed. Observed versus predicted one-year mortality at varying population infection rates and pandemic-related relative risks using our published model in pre-pandemic CKD cohorts (NHSD TRE and Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD]) were compared. Among individuals with CKD (prevalent:1,934,585, incident:144,969), comorbidities were common (73.5% and 71.2% with one or more condition[s] in respective data sets, and 13.2% and 11.2% with three or more conditions, in prevalent and incident CKD), and associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly dialysis/transplantation (odds ratio 2.08, 95% confidence interval 2.04-2.13) and heart failure (1.73, 1.71-1.76), but not cancer (1.01, 1.01-1.04). One-year all-cause mortality varied by age, sex, multi-morbidity and CKD stage. Compared with 34,265 observed excess deaths, in the NHSD-TRE and CPRD databases respectively, we predicted 28,746 and 24,546 deaths (infection rates 10% and relative risks 3.0), and 23,754 and 20,283 deaths (observed infection rates 6.7% and relative risks 3.7). Thus, in this largest, national-level study, individuals with CKD have a high burden of comorbidities and multi-morbidity, and high risk of pre-pandemic and pandemic mortality. Hence, treatment of comorbidities, non-pharmaceutical measures, and vaccination are priorities for people with CKD and management of long-term conditions is important during and beyond the pandemic.

AB  - The destructive effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the elderly and people with cardiovascular disease have been proven. New findings shed light on the role of aging pathways on life span and health age. New therapies that focus on aging-related pathways may positively impact the treatment of this acute respiratory infection. Using new therapies that boost the level of the immune system can support the elderly with co-morbidities against the acute form of COVID-19. This article discusses the effect of the aging immune system against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the pathways affecting this severity of infection.

AB  - The outbreak and spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to an unprecedented wealth of literature on the impact of human coronaviruses on pregnancy. The number of case studies and publications alone are several orders of magnitude larger than those published in all previous human coronavirus outbreaks combined, enabling robust conclusions to be drawn from observations for the first time. However, the importance of learning from previous human coronavirus outbreaks cannot be understated. In this narrative review, we describe what we consider to the major learning points arising from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in relation to pregnancy, and where these confound what might have been expected from previous coronavirus outbreaks.

AB  - Viral diseases are emerging as global threats. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has severe global impacts. Safety, dosage, and potency of vaccines recently approved for emergency use against SARS-CoV-2 need further evaluation. There is still no effective treatment against COVID-19; therefore, safe, and effective vaccines or therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. Oil-in-water nanoemulsions (O/W NEs) are emerging as sophisticated, protective, and therapeutic platforms. Encapsulation capacity, which offers better drug pharmacokinetics, coupled with the tunable surfaces present NEs as promising tools for pharmaceutical applications. The challenges facing drug discovery, and the advancements of NEs in drug delivery demonstrate the potential of NEs against evolving diseases, like COVID-19. Here we summarize current COVID-19 knowledge and discuss the composition, stability, preparation, characterization, and biological fate of O/W NEs. We also provide insights into NE structural-functional properties that may contribute to therapeutic or preventative solutions against COVID-19.

AB  - Deficiency of selenium (Se) has been described in a significant number of COVID-19 patients having a higher incidence of mortality, which makes it a pertinent issue to be addressed clinically for effective management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Se nanoparticles (SeNPs) provide a unique option for managing the havoc caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. SeNPs possess promising anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects by virtue of their nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-stimulator of activated B cells (NFκB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) modulatory activity. In addition, SeNPs possess remarkable immunomodulatory effects, making them a suitable option for supplementation with a much lower risk of toxicity compared to their elemental counterpart. Further, SeNPs have been shown to curtail viral and microbial infections, thus, making it a novel means to halt viral growth. In addition, it can be administered in the form of aerosol spray, direct injection, or infused thin-film transdermal patches to reduce the spread of this highly contagious viral infection. Moreover, a considerable decrease in the expression of selenoprotein along with enhanced expression of IL-6 in COVID-19 suggests a potential association among selenoprotein expression and COVID-19. In this review, we highlight the unique antimicrobial and antiviral properties of SeNPs and the immunomodulatory potential of selenoproteins. We provide the rationale behind their potentially interesting properties and further exploration in the context of microbial and viral infections. Further, the importance of selenoproteins and their role in maintaining a successful immune response along with their association to Se status is summarized.

AB  - There is limited knowledge regarding the cardiovascular impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on emerging adults aged 18-25, a group that disproportionately contracts COVID-19. To guide future cardiovascular disease (CVD) research, policy, and practice, a scoping review was conducted to: (i) examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cardiovascular health of emerging adults; and (ii) identify strategies to screen for and manage COVID-19–related cardiovascular complications in this age group. A comprehensive search strategy was applied to several academic databases and grey literature sources. An updated search yielded 6738 articles, 147 of which were extracted and synthesized. Reports identified COVID-19–associated cardiac abnormalities, vascular alterations, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in emerging adults; based on data from student-athlete samples, prevalence estimates of myocarditis and cardiac abnormalities were 0.5%-3% and 0%-7%, respectively. Obesity, hypertension, CVD, congenital heart disease, and marginalization are potential risk factors for severe COVID-19, related cardiovascular complications, and mortality in this age group. As a screening modality for COVID-19–associated cardiac involvement, it is recommended that cardiac magnetic resonance imaging be indicated by a positive cardiac history and/or abnormal “triad” testing (cardiac troponin, electrocardiogram, and transthoracic echocardiogram) to improve diagnostic utility. To foster long-term cardiovascular health among emerging adults, cardiorespiratory fitness, health literacy and education, and telehealth accessibility should be priorities of health policy and clinical practice. Ultimately, surveillance data from the broader emerging adult population will be crucial to assess the long-term cardiovascular impact of both COVID-19 infection and vaccination, guide screening and management protocols, and inform CVD prevention efforts.
Résumé
Il existe peu de données portant sur les répercussions de la maladie à coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) sur le plan cardiovasculaire chez les jeunes adultes âgés de 18 à 25 ans, un groupe contractant la COVID-19 de façon disproportionnée. Afin d’orienter la recherche, les poli-tiques et les pratiques en matière de maladies cardiovasculaires (MCV), un examen exploratoire a été réalisé dans le but i) d’examiner les conséquences de la pandémie de la COVID-19 sur la santé cardiovasculaire des jeunes adultes, et ii) de proposer des stratégies de dépistage et de prise en charge des complications cardiovasculaires associées à la COVID-19 chez les personnes de cette tranche d’âge. Une recherche initiale exhaustive a été réalisée dans plusieurs bases de données universitaires et sources de littérature grise. Les résultats actualisés de cette recherche ont permis de recenser 6 738 articles, dont 147 ont été extraits et synthétisés. Les rapports faisaient état d’anomalies cardiaques, d’altérations vasculaires et de cas du syndrome inflammatoire multisystémique, tous associés à la COVID-19 chez les jeunes adultes. À la lumière des données sur les échantillons d’étudiants-athlètes, la prévalence des myocardites et des anomalies cardiaques se situait respectivement entre 0,5 et 3 %, et entre 0 et 7 % environ. Chez ce même groupe d’âge, l’obésité, l’hypertension, les MCV, les cardiopathies congénitales et la marginalisation constituent des facteurs de risque de COVID-19 sévère, de complications cardiovasculaires associées à la COVID-19 et de mortalité. Dans le cadre du dépistage des atteintes cardiaques associées à la COVID-19, il est recommandé, pour améliorer l’utilité diagnostique, d’indiquer l’imagerie par résonance magnétique cardiaque lors de l’existence d’antécédents cardiaques ou à la suite d’une « triade » de dépistages anormaux (la troponine cardiaque, l’électrocardiogramme et l’échocardiographie transthoracique). Afin de favoriser une bonne santé cardiovasculaire à long terme chez les jeunes adultes, il est recommandé que la capacité cardiorespiratoire, la littératie dans le domaine de la santé, l’éducation et l’accès à la télésanté soient intégrés à titre de priorités dans les politiques de santé et la pratique clinique. En définitive, les données de surveillance portant sur cette large tranche d’âge seront essentielles pour évaluer les répercussions cardiovasculaires à long terme (autant celles d'infections à la COVID-19 que celles de la vaccination), pour orienter les protocoles de dépistage et de prise en charge, ainsi que pour éclairer les efforts de prévention des MCV.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma has emerged as a promising therapy and has been granted Emergency Use Authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We recently reported results from interim analysis of a propensity score–matched study suggesting that early treatment of COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma containing high-titer anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG significantly decreases mortality. We herein present results from a 60-day follow-up of a cohort of 351 transfused hospitalized patients. Prospective determination of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay anti-RBD IgG titer facilitated selection and transfusion of the highest titer units available. Retrospective analysis by the Ortho VITROS IgG assay revealed a median signal/cutoff ratio of 24.0 for transfused units, a value far exceeding the recent US Food and Drug Administration–required cutoff of 12.0 for designation of high-titer convalescent plasma. With respect to altering mortality, our analysis identified an optimal window of 44 hours after hospitalization for transfusing COVID-19 patients with high-titer convalescent plasma. In the aggregate, the analysis confirms and extends our previous preliminary finding that transfusion of COVID-19 patients soon after hospitalization with high-titer anti-spike protein RBD IgG present in convalescent plasma significantly reduces mortality.

AB  - Objectives
The relative scarcity of paediatric COVID-19 disease infers protection from its direct harms. We aim to highlight the potentially severe indirect effects of COVID-19 upon global childhood pneumonia.
Study design
This is a discussion piece written from the authors’ perspective.
Methods
We use the social determinants of health to describe the indirect impact of COVID-19 upon global childhood pneumonia.
Results
The social determinants of health are a range of social, economic, and environmental factors used to explore and explain global health differences and inequalities. Global childhood pneumonia is a significant public health problem with clear linkage to the social determinants of health. COVID-19 is a significant threat to the health and wellbeing of children around the world through its potentially severe effects on all strata of the social determinants of health.
Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic could undermine years of progress in reducing both global childhood pneumonia incidence and mortality, and most significantly affect vulnerable children living in poverty.

AB  - Background
The study was initiated in 2020 to test the efficacy of a nitric oxide-generating lozenge (NOL) in outpatients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 to mitigate disease severity. The study enrolled high-risk patients, African American and Latino.
Methods
This was a randomized, double-blinded, prospective, placebo-controlled trial. The primary endpoint was hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, intubation, dialysis, and death. The secondary endpoints were time to symptom resolution and the effect on oxygen saturation. Patients ages 50-85 years with recent COVID-19 diagnosis with at least one risk factor were recruited. Patients were randomized to either active treatment or placebo using block randomization. Blood pressure and oxygen saturation (SpO2) was measured prior to and after the first dose and each morning thereafter.
Results
A total of 840 patients was planned, half in each of the lozenge and placebo groups. An interim review of data was prespecified. Of 524 patients, the composite endpoint occurred in 6 patients, 3 (1.1%) in each group. The time to symptom resolution was 1 day shorter on active treatment (8.7 ± 6.6 vs 9.8 ± 6.8 days) (P = .3). There was no change in SpO2 on placebo (0.0 ± 2.0%) and no significant change on treatment (0.14 ± 0.9%), P = .3. All events occurred in the first year (2020).
Conclusions
This study did not find a benefit of NOL therapy in COVID-19 patients and was terminated for futility. NOL treatment did not reduce mortality, hospitalization, intubation, or a reduction in symptoms duration. The study did find the NO lozenges were well tolerated in high-risk patients, without reported side effects.

AB  - Background
The international healthcare response to COVID-19 has been driven by epidemiological data related to case numbers and case fatality rate. Second order effects have been less well studied. This study aimed to characterise the changes in emergency activity of a high-volume cardiac catheterisation centre and to cautiously model any excess indirect morbidity and mortality.
Method
Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome fulfilling criteria for the heart attack centre (HAC) pathway at St. Bartholomew’s hospital, UK. Electronic data were collected for the study period March 16th – May 16th 2020 inclusive and stored on a dedicated research server. Standard governance procedures were observed in line with the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society audit.
Results
There was a 28% fall in the number of primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) during the study period (111 vs. 154) and 36% fewer activations of the HAC pathway (312 vs. 485), compared to the same time period averaged across three preceding years. In the context of ‘missing STEMIs’, the excess harm attributable to COVID-19 could result in an absolute increase of 1.3% in mortality, 1.9% in nonfatal MI and 4.5% in recurrent ischemia.
Conclusions
The emergency activity of a high-volume PCI centre was significantly reduced for STEMI during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19. Our data can be used as an exemplar to help future modelling within cardiovascular workstreams to refine aggregate estimates of the impact of COVID-19 and inform targeted policy action.

AB  - Summary
Background
The literature on first generation COVID-19 vaccines show they were less effective against new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern including Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants). New vaccines developed against variant strains may provide cross-protection against emerging variants when used as boosters and facilitate vaccination across a range of countries, healthcare settings and populations. However, there are no data on such vaccines when used as a primary series.
Methods
A global Phase 3, multi-stage efficacy study (NCT04904549) among adults (≥18 years) was conducted in 53 research centres in eight countries (United States, Honduras, Japan, Colombia, Kenya, India, Ghana, Nepal). Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive two intramuscular injections of a monovalent SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein vaccine with AS03-adjuvant (10 μg of the spike (S) protein from the ancestral D614 strain) or placebo on Day 1 (D01) and Day 22 (D22). The primary efficacy endpoint was prevention of virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with symptoms of COVID-19-like illness (CLI) ≥14 days after the second injection (post-dose 2 [PD2]) in participants who were SARS-CoV-2 naïve on D01 + D22. Safety and reactogenicity were also evaluated.
Findings
Between May 26 and November 7, 2021, 10,114 participants received ≥1 study injection, and 9441 participants received both injections. 2108 (20.8%) participants were SARS-CoV-2 naïve at D01 and D22. The primary endpoint was analysed in a subset of the full analysis set (the modified full analysis set PD2 [mFAS-PD2], excluding participants who did not complete the vaccination schedule or received vaccination despite meeting one of the contraindication criteria, had onset of symptomatic COVID-19 between the first injection and before 14 days after the second injection, or participants who discontinued before 14 days after the second injection [n = 9377; vaccine, n = 4702; placebo, n = 4675]). Data were available for 2051 SARS-CoV-2 naïve and 7159 non-naïve participants. At the cut-off date (January 28, 2022), symptomatic COVID-19 was reported in 169 naïve participants (vaccine, n = 81; placebo, n = 88) ≥14 days PD2, with a vaccine efficacy (VE) of 15.3% (95% CI, −15.8; 38.2). VE regardless of D01/D22 serostatus was 32.9% (95% CI, 15.3; 47.0) and VE in non-naïve participants was 52.7% (95% CI, 31.2; 67.9). Viral genome sequencing was performed up to the data cut-off point and identified the infecting strain in 99/169 adjudicated cases in the PD2 naïve population (Delta [25], Omicron [72], other variants [3], one participant had infection with both Delta and Omicron variants and has been included in the totals for both Delta and Omicron). The vaccine was well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile.
Interpretation
In the context of changing circulating viral variants, it is challenging to induce protection in naïve individuals with a two-dose priming schedule based on the parental D614 strain. However, while the primary endpoint of this trial was not met, the results show that a monovalent D614 vaccine can still be of value in individuals previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Despite unprecedented progress in developing COVID-19 vaccines, global vaccination levels needed to reach herd immunity remain a distant target, while new variants keep emerging. Obtaining near universal vaccine uptake relies on understanding and addressing vaccine resistance. Simple questions about vaccine acceptance however ignore that the vaccines being offered vary across countries and even population subgroups, and differ in terms of efficacy and side effects. By using advanced discrete choice models estimated on stated choice data collected in 18 countries/territories across six continents, we show a substantial influence of vaccine characteristics. Uptake increases if more efficacious vaccines (95% vs 60%) are offered (mean across study areas = 3.9%, range of 0.6%–8.1%) or if vaccines offer at least 12 months of protection (mean across study areas = 2.4%, range of 0.2%–5.8%), while an increase in severe side effects (from 0.001% to 0.01%) leads to reduced uptake (mean = −1.3%, range of −0.2% to −3.9%). Additionally, a large share of individuals (mean = 55.2%, range of 28%–75.8%) would delay vaccination by 3 months to obtain a more efficacious (95% vs 60%) vaccine, where this increases further if the low efficacy vaccine has a higher risk (0.01% instead of 0.001%) of severe side effects (mean = 65.9%, range of 41.4%–86.5%). Our work highlights that careful consideration of which vaccines to offer can be beneficial. In support of this, we provide an interactive tool to predict uptake in a country as a function of the vaccines being deployed, and also depending on the levels of infectiousness and severity of circulating variants of COVID-19.

AB  - Cardiometabolic diseases and abnormalities have recently emerged as independent risk factors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, including hospitalizations, invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Determining whether and how this observation translates to more effective long-term pandemic mitigation strategies remains a challenge due to key research gaps. Specific pathways by which cardiometabolic pathophysiology affects humoral immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and vice versa, remain unclear. This review summarizes current evidence of the bidirectional influences between cardiometabolic diseases (diabetes, adiposity, hypertension, CVDs) and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies induced from infection and vaccination based on human studies. Ninety-two studies among >408,000 participants in 37 countries on 5 continents (Europe, Asia, Africa, and North and South America) were included in this review. Obesity was associated with higher neutralizing antibody titers following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most studies conducted prior to vaccinations found positive or null associations between binding antibodies (levels, seropositivity) and diabetes; after vaccinations, antibody responses did not differ by diabetes. Hypertension and CVDs were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Findings underscore the importance of elucidating the extent that tailored recommendations for COVID-19 prevention, vaccination effectiveness, screening, and diagnoses among people with obesity could reduce disease burden caused by SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - This review on COVID-19 immunotherapy enables a comparative analysis of the short-list of currently approved major vaccines. These include the Pfizer and Moderna first mRNA vaccines under FDA purview and the Oxford/AstraZeneca simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine (under UK-MHPRA guidance), all produced in record time, being safe and effective. The Pfizer and Moderna double dose vaccines have the clear edge in treatment efficacy, being in the 90% range compared to AstraZeneca in the average 70%. However, the AZ double dose vaccine has significant advantages with respect to lower cost and stability in storage. We enumerate several potential advances in the technology of the manufacturers: (1) combination vaccines such as testing AstraZeneca’s product with a component of the Russian’s Sputnik V to achieve durable immunity; (2) the potential for single dose vaccines coming on-line, and with Johnson & Johnson/Janssen; and (3) the need for refined thermotolerant formulations obviating the need for cold storage. As an adjunct to vaccinotherapy, affinity adsorption column technology is another facet recruited in the processing of corona convalescent plasma/cryosupernatant to concentrate neutralizing antibodies against the virus. Clinical trials, to date, of infected patients have been indeterminate as to whether plasmapheresis-based products are effective or not. This is due to the failure to standardize the composition of the plasma derived component, ambiguous clinical indications for use in human subjects, and inconsistent timing of administration in the course of the infection. Known T-cell lymphopenia, which is attendant to progressive viral infection and immune driven inflammation, may be a quantitative surrogate biological marker as to when to start treatment. This is not only for initiating plasmapheresis-based therapeutics but also the judicious selection of ancillary pharmaceuticals, ie. monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins and anti-viral drugs.

AB  - Summary
In April, 2020, just months into the COVID-19 pandemic, an international group of public health researchers published three lessons learned from the HIV pandemic for the response to COVID-19, which were to: anticipate health inequalities, create an enabling environment to support behavioural change, and engage a multidisciplinary effort. We revisit these lessons in light of more than 2 years’ experience with the COVID-19 pandemic. With specific examples, we detail how inequalities have played out within and between countries, highlight factors that support or impede the creation of enabling environments, and note ongoing issues with the scarcity of integrated science and health system approaches. We argue that to better apply lessons learned as the COVID-19 pandemic matures and other infectious disease outbreaks emerge, it will be imperative to create dialogue among polarised perspectives, identify shared priorities, and draw on multidisciplinary evidence.

AB  - Patients with COVID-19 and underlying hematological malignancy seem to have a higher mortality rate compared with those patients without malignancy, however, the extent of such excess risk is unclear. We performed a systematic review of literature and a pooled analysis to provide precise estimates of the mortality rate among patients with both hematological malignancy and COVID-19. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search including peer-reviewed publications, preprints, and conference proceedings up to July 16, 2020. Only studies including exclusively patients with hematological malignancies were considered. The primary endpoint was the case fatality rate (CFR), which was defined as rate of death in patients with hematological malignancy and COVID-19. A random effects model was used to derive a pooled CFR and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: In total, 10 studies including 751 patients with both COVID-19 and hematological malignancy were selected for the pooled analysis (Table 1). A total of 257 deaths were recorded in this population. The probability of death was 37·48% (95% CI 27·74% to 48.36%; I2=48·1%) in this patient population (Figure 1). [Data will be updated closer to the ASH 2020 meeting]. Conclusions: Patients with both COVID-19 and hematological malignancy have a higher probability of mortality compared to patients with COVID-19 but without underlying malignancy. Optimally and tailored preventive measures are needed to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with hematological malignancies; this patient population should be priority for vaccine campaigns.

AB  - Summary
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting mental health globally. While increased social cohesion may have initially decreased suicide risk, there are few reports on the long-term impact. We examined the impact of the pandemic on suicide by gender and age through December 2021 in Japan.
Methods
We analyzed trends in monthly suicide rates by age and gender from January 2016 to December 2021 using provisional mortality data in an interrupted time series analysis. We also considered linear trends in the pre-pandemic period and seasonal variations. Pandemic onset was defined as from April 2020. Estimated excess deaths by suicide that occurred during the pandemic were calculated.
Findings
Excess number of suicide deaths during the pandemic period was estimated to be 1208 for men and 1825 for women. While there was no statistically significant increase in suicide rates overall for both men and women during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic, age-specific analyses showed a statistically significant increase in men 20–29 and 40–49 years, and in women of all age groups, except those under 20, 40–49 and over 80 years.
Interpretation
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on suicide rates in Japan and the impact is most pronounced in women and younger age groups. Subgroup analyses are needed, with a particular focus on those considered to be vulnerable and at increased suicide risk.

AB  - In a recent modeling study Watson et al. (Lancet Infect Dis 2022;3099:1-10) claim that Covid-19 vaccinations have helped to prevent roughly 14–20 million deaths in 2021. This conclusion is based on an epidemiological susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model trained on partially simulated data and yielding a reproduction number distribution which was then applied to a counterfactual scenario in which the efficacy of vaccinations was removed. Drawing on the meta-theory of Critical Realism, we point out several caveats of this model and caution against believing in its predictions. We argue that the absence of vaccinations would have significantly changed the causal tendencies of the system being modelled, yielding a different reproduction number than obtained from training the model on actually observed data. Furthermore, the model omits many important causal factors. Therefore this model, similar to many previous SEIR models, has oversimplified the complex interplay between biomedical, social and cultural dimensions of health and should not be used to guide public health policy. In order to predict the future in epidemic situations more accurately, continuously optimized dynamic causal models which can include the not directly tangible, yet real causal mechanisms affecting public health appear to be a promising alternative to SEIR-type models.

AB  - Summary
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic priorities have focused on prevention, detection, and response. Beyond morbidity and mortality, pandemics carry secondary impacts, such as children orphaned or bereft of their caregivers. Such children often face adverse consequences, including poverty, abuse, and institutionalisation. We provide estimates for the magnitude of this problem resulting from COVID-19 and describe the need for resource allocation.
Methods
We used mortality and fertility data to model minimum estimates and rates of COVID-19-associated deaths of primary or secondary caregivers for children younger than 18 years in 21 countries. We considered parents and custodial grandparents as primary caregivers, and co-residing grandparents or older kin (aged 60–84 years) as secondary caregivers. To avoid overcounting, we adjusted for possible clustering of deaths using an estimated secondary attack rate and age-specific infection–fatality ratios for SARS-CoV-2. We used these estimates to model global extrapolations for the number of children who have experienced COVID-19-associated deaths of primary and secondary caregivers.
Findings
Globally, from March 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021, we estimate 1 134 000 children (95% credible interval 884 000–1 185 000) experienced the death of primary caregivers, including at least one parent or custodial grandparent. 1 562 000 children (1 299 000–1 683 000) experienced the death of at least one primary or secondary caregiver. Countries in our study set with primary caregiver death rates of at least one per 1000 children included Peru (10·2 per 1000 children), South Africa (5·1), Mexico (3·5), Brazil (2·4), Colombia (2·3), Iran (1·7), the USA (1·5), Argentina (1·1), and Russia (1·0). Numbers of children orphaned exceeded numbers of deaths among those aged 15–50 years. Between two and five times more children had deceased fathers than deceased mothers.
Interpretation
Orphanhood and caregiver deaths are a hidden pandemic resulting from COVID-19-associated deaths. Accelerating equitable vaccine delivery is key to prevention. Psychosocial and economic support can help families to nurture children bereft of caregivers and help to ensure that institutionalisation is avoided.

AB  - Summary
Background
People with learning disabilities are at substantially increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, but evidence on risks of COVID-19 mortality for disabled people more generally is limited. We aimed to use population-level data to estimate the association between self-reported disability and death involving COVID-19 during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in England.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study of adults aged 30–100 years living in private households or communal establishments in England, using data from the Office for National Statistics Public Health Data Asset. Participants were present at the 2011 Census and alive on Jan 24, 2020. Participants reported being limited a lot in their daily activities, limited a little, or not limited at all, in response to a question from the 2011 Census. The outcome was death involving COVID-19, occurring between Jan 24, 2020, and Feb 28, 2021. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between disability and death involving COVID-19, sequentially adjusting for age, residence type (private household, care home, or other communal establishment), geographical characteristics (local authority district and population density), sociodemographic characteristics (ethnicity, highest qualification, Index of Multiple Deprivation decile, household characteristics [National Statistics Socio-economic Classification of the household reference person, tenure of household, household size, family status, household composition, and key worker in household], key worker type, individual and household exposure to disease, and individual and household proximity to others), and health status (pre-existing health conditions, body-mass index, and number of admissions to hospital and days spent in hospital over the previous 3 years).
Findings
29 293 845 adults were included in the study (13 806 623 [47%] men, 15 487 222 [53%] women), of whom 3 038 772 (10%) reported being limited a little and 2 011 576 (7%) reported being limited a lot. During follow-up, 105 213 people died from causes involving COVID-19 in England, 61 416 (58%) of whom were disabled. Age-adjusted analyses showed higher mortality involving COVID-19 among disabled people who were limited a lot (HR 3·05 [95% CI 2·98–3·11] for men; 3·48 [3·41–3·56] for women) and disabled people who were limited a little (HR 1·88 [1·84–1·92] for men; 2·03 [1·98–2·08] for women) than among non-disabled people. Adjustment for residence type, geography, sociodemographics, and health conditions reduced but did not eliminate the associations between disability and death involving COVID-19 (HR 1·35 [1·32–1·38] for men who were limited a lot; 1·21 [1·18–1·23] for men who were limited a little; 1·55 [1·51–1·59] for women who were limited a lot; and 1·28 [1·25–1·31] for women who were limited a little).
Interpretation
Given the association between disability and mortality involving COVID-19, verification of these findings and consideration of recommendations for protective measures are now required.

AB  - With mortality rising from the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be overlooking a key aspect of the immunological response. Fever is a cardinal sign of this rampant infection; however, little attention has been paid towards how a fever may work in our favor in overcoming this disease. Three key aspects of patient care – fever, fluid, and food – can be harmonized to overcome COVID-19 infection. Both animal and human studies have demonstrated that fever suppression during viral infections, either through low ambient temperatures or antipyretic use, may increase morbidity and prolong the illness. As fever rises, so do antidiuretic hormone levels, leading to solute-free water retention – making conservative fluid management essential. Finally, fever inhibits gastrointestinal function as energy is reallocated to the immunological response, underscoring the need to work in concert with these physiological changes. An opportunity awaits to investigate this natural barrier to infection, let us not pass it by.

AB  - Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on cardiac surgery patients. Significant reductions in access to surgical treatment have forced surgeons to prioritise patients and follow strict COVID-19 protocols to protect surgeons, staff, and patients. Adult cardiac surgery and the COVID-19 pandemic: aggressive infection mitigation strategies are necessary in the operating room and surgical recovery. Nosocomial infections among cardiac surgery patients have been reported and are associated with a high mortality rate. As a COVID-19 tertiary care centre and a tertiary cardiac centre, we tried to balance the need to operate on urgent cardiac cases while protecting patients and staff from COVID-19.
Methods
During the first wave of the pandemic, we performed 579 surgeries. We report findings from an outbreak of 4 nosocomial infections.
Results
All patients tested negative within 24 hours of surgery or admission. Three patients were positive after surgery, suggesting an overall nosocomial rate during the first wave of 0.5% (3/579). One patient admitted for evaluation tested positive during mass screening. Two of the 4 patients died after respiratory complications. No health care worker (HCW) or family member with direct contact with these patients tested positive for COVID-19. Nosocomial COVID-19 infection is uncommon when adhering to safety protocols. Although uncommon, the mortality rate is high (50%) in our series.
Conclusions
As widespread vaccination of HCWs and high-risk individuals susceptible to COVID-19 is in progress, we suggest that cardiac surgery patients, when feasible, be vaccinated before surgery given this could prevent excess mortality, protect HCWs and reduce resource use.
Résumé
Contexte
La pandémie de COVID-19 a eu des répercussions importantes sur les patients en chirurgie cardiaque. Les réductions importantes de l'accès aux traitements chirurgicaux ont obligé les chirurgiens à classer les patients par ordre de priorité et à suivre des protocoles COVID-19 rigoureux pour protéger les chirurgiens, le personnel et les patients. En ce qui a trait à la chirurgie cardiaque chez les adultes pendant la pandémie de COVID-19, des stratégies énergiques d'atténuation des infections sont nécessaires en salle d'opération et pendant la convalescence. Des infections nosocomiales ont été signalées chez des patients de chirurgie cardiaque; elles sont associées à un taux de mortalité élevé. Comme notre centre de soins tertiaires traite à la fois des patients atteints de troubles cardiaques et des patients atteints de la COVID-19, nous avons essayé de trouver un équilibre entre la nécessité d'effectuer les opérations cardiaques urgentes et la protection des patients et du personnel contre la COVID-19.
Méthodologie
Pendant la première vague de la pandémie, nous avons effectué 579 interventions chirurgicales. Nous rapportons les résultats d'une éclosion de quatre infections nosocomiales.
Résultats
Tous les patients ont obtenu un résultat négatif au test de dépistage dans les 24 heures suivant l'intervention ou l'admission. Trois patients ont obtenu un résultat positif à ce test après l'intervention, ce qui indique un taux global d'infection nosocomiale de 0,5 % (3 / 579) au cours de la première vague. Un patient admis pour évaluation a obtenu un résultat positif au moment du dépistage de masse. Deux des quatre patients sont morts après des complications respiratoires. Aucun travailleur de la santé ou membre de la famille ayant eu un contact direct avec ces patients n'a obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19. L'infection nosocomiale à la COVID-19 est rare quand les protocoles de sécurité sont respectés. Mais même si elle est peu fréquente, le taux de mortalité associé est élevé (50 %) dans notre série.
Conclusions
Alors que la vaccination généralisée des travailleurs de la santé et des personnes à haut risque vulnérables à la COVID-19 est en cours, nous suggérons que les patients en chirurgie cardiaque soient vaccinés avant l'opération, si possible, car cela pourrait prévenir la surmortalité, protéger les travailleurs de la santé et réduire l'utilisation des ressources.

AB  - Summary
Background
During the COVID-19 pandemic, men who have sex with men (MSM) in the USA have reported similar or fewer sexual partners and reduced HIV testing and care access compared with before the pandemic. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use has also declined. We aimed to quantify the potential effect of COVID-19 on HIV incidence and HIV-related mortality among US MSM.
Methods
We used a calibrated, deterministic, compartmental HIV transmission model for MSM in Baltimore (MD, USA) and available data on COVID-19-related disruptions to HIV services to predict effects of reductions in sexual partners (0%, 25%, 50%), condom use (5%), HIV testing (20%), viral suppression (10%), PrEP initiations (72%), PrEP adherence (9%), and antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiations (50%). In our main analysis, we modelled disruptions due to COVID-19 starting Jan 1, 2020, and lasting 6 months. We estimated the median change in cumulative new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths among MSM over 1 and 5 years, compared with a base case scenario without COVID-19-related disruptions.
Findings
A 25% reduction in sexual partners for 6 months among MSM in Baltimore, without HIV service changes, could reduce new HIV infections by median 12·2% (95% credible interval 11·7 to 12·8) over 1 year and median 3·0% (2·6 to 3·4) over 5 years. In the absence of changes in sexual behaviour, the 6-month estimated reductions in condom use, HIV testing, viral suppression, PrEP initiations, PrEP adherence, and ART initiations combined are predicted to increase new HIV infections by median 10·5% (5·8 to 16·5) over 1 year, and by median 3·5% (2·1 to 5·4) over 5 years. Disruptions to ART initiations and viral suppression are estimated to substantially increase HIV-related deaths (ART initiations by median 1·7% [0·8 to 3·2], viral suppression by median 9·5% [5·2 to 15·9]) over 1 year, with smaller proportional increases over 5 years. The other individual disruptions (to HIV testing, PrEP and condom use, PrEP initiation, and partner numbers) were estimated to have little effect on HIV-related deaths (<1% change over 1 or 5 years). A 25% reduction in sexual partnerships is estimated to offset the effect of the combined service disruptions on new HIV infections (change over 1 year: median –3·9% [–7·4 to 1·0]; over 5 years: median 0·0% [–0·9 to 1·4]), but not on HIV deaths (change over 1 year: 11·0% [6·2 to 17·7]; over 5 years: 2·6% [1·5 to 4·3]).
Interpretation
Maintaining access to ART and adherence support is of the utmost importance to maintain viral suppression and minimise excess HIV-related mortality due to COVID-19 restrictions in the USA, even if disruptions to services are accompanied by reductions in sexual partnerships.

AB  - Background
Obesity is a risk factor for COVID-19. However, it is unknown whether weight changes can alter this risk. We investigated the association of weight changes with SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute severe COVID-19 outcomes occurring within two months of the infection.
Methods
We used 6.3 million nationwide cohort. The body weight was classified as follows: (1) underweight, body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m2; (2) normal, BMI 18.5–22.9 kg/m2; (3) overweight, BMI 23–24.9 kg/m2; (4) obese, BMI≥ 25 kg/m2. Weight changes were defined by comparing the classification of body weight during the health screening period I and II. The outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes within two months after the infection. The association was evaluated using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. The following covariates were adjusted: age, sex, household income, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, Charlson comorbidity index score, and dose of all COVID-19 vaccinations prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Results
Of the 2119,460 study participants, 184,204 were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Weight gain showed a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in underweight to normal and normal to overweight groups. Conversely, weight loss showed a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in normal to underweight, overweight to underweight, overweight to normal, obese to normal, and obese to overweight groups. In addition, weight gain revealed a higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, whereas weight loss showed a lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes.
Conclusion
This study found that weight loss and gain are associated with a lower and higher risk of both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes, respectively. Healthy weight management may be beneficial against the risk of COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic arrived at a time of faltering global poverty reduction and increasing levels of diet-related diseases, both of which have a strong link to poor outcomes for those with COVID-19. Governments responded to the pandemic by placing unprecedented restrictions on internal and external movements, which have resulted in an economic contraction. In response to the economic shock, G20 governments have committed to providing US$14 trillion stimuli to support economic recovery. We aimed to assess the impact of different COVID-19 recovery paths on human health, environmental sustainability, and food sustainability.
Methods
We used LandSyMM, a global gridded land use change model, to analyse the impact of recovery paths from COVID-19. The paths were illustrated by four scenarios that represent different pandemic severities (including a single or recurrent pandemic) and alternate modes of recovery, including a transition of food demand towards healthier diets that result in changes to the food system: (1) solidarity and celery, (2) nothing new, (3) fries and fragmentation, and (4) best laid plans. For each scenario, we modelled the economic shocks of the pandemic and the impact of policy measures to promote healthier diets in the years after the COVID-19 pandemic, including the supply of and demand for food, environmental outcomes, and human health outcomes. The four scenarios use established future population growth and economic development projections derived from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 2. We quantified the outcomes from more societally cooperative pandemic responses that result in reduced trade barriers and improved technological development against less cooperative responses.
Findings
Repeated pandemic shocks (the fries and fragmentation and best laid plans scenarios) reduce the ability of the lowest income countries to ensure food security. A post-pandemic recovery that includes dietary transition towards the consumption of less meat and more fruits and vegetables (the solidarity and celery scenario) could prevent 2583 premature deaths per million in 2060, whereas recovery paths that are focused on economic recovery (the fries and fragmentation scenario) could trigger an additional 778 deaths per million in 2060. The transition of dietary preferences towards healthier diets (the solidarity and celery scenario) also reduces nitrogen fertiliser use by 40 million tonnes and irrigation water by 400 km3 compared with no dietary change in 2060 (the nothing new scenario). Finally, the scenario with dietary transition increases the affordability of the average diet.
Interpretation
The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is most visible in low-income countries, where a reduction in growth projections makes a greater difference to the affordability of a basic diet. A change in dietary preferences is most impactful in reducing mortality and the burden of disease when income levels are high. At lower income, a transition towards lower meat consumption reduces undernourishment and diet-related mortality.

The present study aimed to analyze the different factors associated with physical activity that could have an impact in the COVID-19, providing a practical recommendation based on actual scientific knowledge. We conducted a consensus critical review using primary sources, scientific articles, and secondary bibliographic indexes, databases, and web pages. The method was a narrative literature review of the available literature regarding physical activity and physical activity related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main online database used in the present research were PubMed, SciELO, and Google Scholar. COVID-19 has negatively influenced motor behavior, levels of regular exercise practice, eating and nutritional patterns, and the psychological status of citizens. These factors feed into each other, worsening COVID-19 symptoms, the risk of death from SARS-CoV-2, and the symptoms and effectiveness of the vaccine. The characteristics and symptoms related with the actual COVID-19 pandemic made the physical activity interventions a valuable prevention and treatment factor. Physical activity improves body composition, the cardiorespiratory, metabolic, and mental health of patients and enhancing antibody responses in vaccination.

By applying these different plant capacity concepts, the authors seek to measure the use of existing capacities, as well as the evolution and build-up of extra hospital capacity in the Chinese province of Hubei during the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in early 2020. Furthermore, medical literature has established that mortality rates increase with high capacity utilization rates, an insight that this study leverages to select the most plausible of eight plant capacity concepts. The preliminary results indicate that a relatively new, input-oriented plant capacity concept correlates best with mortality.

AB  - Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected certain groups, such as older people (ie, >65 years), minority ethnic populations, and people with specific chronic conditions including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and some respiratory diseases. There is now evidence of not only direct but also indirect adverse effects of COVID-19 in people with diabetes. Recurrent lockdowns and public health measures throughout the pandemic have restricted access to routine diabetes care, limiting new diagnoses, and affecting self-management, routine follow-ups, and access to medications, as well as affecting lifestyle behaviours and emotional wellbeing globally. Pre-pandemic studies have shown that short-term delays in delivery of routine care, even by 12 months, are associated with adverse effects on risk factor control and worse microvascular, macrovascular, and mortality outcomes in people with diabetes. Disruptions within the short-to-medium term due to natural disasters also result in worse diabetes outcomes. However, the true magnitude of the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term outcomes and mortality in people with diabetes is still unclear. Disasters tend to exacerbate existing health disparities; as we recover ambulatory diabetes services in the aftermath of the pandemic, there is an opportunity to prioritise those with the greatest need, and to target resources and interventions aimed at improving outcomes and reducing inequality.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a current pandemic that has resulted in nearly 250 million cases and over 5 million deaths. While vaccines have been developed to prevent infection, and most COVID-19 cases end up being fairly light, there are severe cases of COVID-19 that may end up in death, even with adequate healthcare treatment. New options to combat this disease’s effects, therefore, could prove to be invaluable in saving lives. Adamalysins are proteins that have several roles in regulating different functions in the human body but are also known to have functions in inflammation. They are also known to have roles in several different diseases, including COVID-19, where ADAM17, in particular, is now well-known to have a prominent role, but also several diseases which include comorbidities that may worsen cases of COVID-19. Therefore, investigating the functions of adamalysins in disease may give us clues to the molecular workings of COVID-19 as well as potentially new therapeutic targets. Understanding these molecular mechanisms may also allow for an understanding of the mechanisms behind the rare severe side effects that occur in response to current COVID-19 vaccines, which may lead to better monitoring measures for people who may be more at risk of developing these side effects. This review investigates the known roles and functions of adamalysins in disease, including what is currently known of their involvement in COVID-19, and how these functions might be involved.

AB  - Objectives
SARS-CoV-2 transmission in sub-Saharan Africa has probably been underestimated. Population-based seroprevalence studies are needed to determine the extent of transmission in the continent.
Methods
Blood samples from a cohort of Gambian pregnant women were tested for SARS-CoV-2 total receptor binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin (Ig) M/IgG before (Pre-pandemic: October-December 2019) and during the pandemic (Pre-wave 1: February-June 2020; Post-wave 1: October-December 2020, Post-wave 2: May-June 2021; and Post-wave 3: October-December 2021). Samples reactive for SARS-CoV-2 total RBD IgM/IgG were tested in specific S1- and nucleocapsid (NCP) IgG assays.
Results
SARS-CoV-2 total RBD IgM/IgG seroprevalence was 0.9% 95% confidence interval (0.2, 4.9) in Pre-pandemic; 4.1% (1.4, 11.4) in Pre-wave 1; 31.1% (25.2, 37.7) in Post-wave 1; 62.5% (55.8, 68.8) in Post-wave 2 and 90.0% (85.1, 93.5) in Post-wave 3. S-protein IgG and NCP-protein IgG seroprevalence also increased at each Post-wave period. Although S-protein IgG and NCP-protein IgG seroprevalence was similar at Post-wave 1, S-protein IgG seroprevalence was higher at Post-wave 2 and Post-wave 3, (prevalence difference 13.5 [0.1, 26.8] and prevalence ratio 1.5 [1.0, 2.3] in Post-wave 2; and 22.9 [9.2, 36.6] and 1.4 [1.1, 1.8] in Post-wave 3 respectively, P <0.001).
Conclusion
SARS-CoV-2 transmission in The Gambia during the first 3 COVID-19 waves was high, differing significantly from official numbers of COVID-19 cases reported. Our findings are important for policy makers in managing the near-endemic COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
Background
The dominant effect of age on COVID-19 mortality obscures the impact of other risk factors. Although the elderly is at a greater risk of severe disease and death due to COVID-19, the interaction of obesity and age was not carefully assessed. This analysis is especially critical for prioritizing groups to receive COVID-19 vaccination.
Methods
Starting with 1,120,767 unvaccinated individuals registered in a Brazilian surveillance system, we selected 313,898 hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 20 to 89 who had a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) or diabetes, as well as individuals with no risk factors associated with severe COVID-19. Patient data were stratified by age, obesity, BMI, and comorbidities, and subsequently, subjected to crude and adjusted odds ratio, hazard ratio, and Kaplan–Meier curves. Disease outcomes were invasive and non-invasive ventilatory support, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death.
Findings
Obesity alone is a risk factor for in-hospital mortality and is more significant than cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Furthermore, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes increase the risk of severity and death by COVID-19 more significantly in young adults than in the elderly. When categorizing patients by obesity classes, the severity of obesity was found to be associated with a higher risk of admission to the ICU and death from COVID-19 than the non-obese young adults or elderly population.
Interpretation
Our findings highlight the increased risk of severe COVID-19 on the Brazilian obese youth. As SARS-CoV-2 may become a recurrent seasonal infection, future vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 should prioritize obese young individuals.

AB  - Summary
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically perturbed the epidemiology of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) respiratory tract infections in children. The reasons for this are not clear. In this article, we review the current literature and critically discuss the different theories to explain why the epidemiology of RSV has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed mechanisms include decreased viral immunity in vulnerable age groups caused by the prolonged lack of RSV circulation early in the pandemic, potential Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced immune dysregulation, viral interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, and modifications in health-seeking behaviors as well as heath systems factors. Research in viral genomics and phylogeny, and more robust immunology research is needed to guide RSV prevention and health care resource planning.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, causing considerable mortality and morbidity worldwide, has fully engaged the biomedical community in attempts to elucidate the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and develop robust therapeutic strategies. To this end, the predominant research focus has been on the adaptive immune response to COVID-19 infections stimulated by mRNA and protein vaccines and on the duration and persistence of immune protection. In contrast, the role of the innate immune response to the viral challenge has been underrepresented. This overview focuses on the innate immune response to COVID-19 infection, with an emphasis on the roles of extracellular proteases in the tissue microenvironment. Proteinase-mediated signaling caused by enzymes in the extracellular microenvironment occurs upstream of the increased production of inflammatory cytokines that mediate COVID-19 pathology. These enzymes include the coagulation cascade, kinin-generating plasma kallikrein, and the complement system, as well as angiotensin-generating proteinases of the renin–angiotensin system. Furthermore, in the context of several articles in this Supplement elucidating and detailing the trajectory of diverse profibrotic pathways, we extrapolate these insights to explore how fibrosis and profibrotic pathways participate importantly in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. We propose that the lessons garnered from understanding the roles of microenvironment proteinases in triggering the innate immune response to COVID-19 pathology will identify potential therapeutic targets and inform approaches to the clinical management of COVID-19. Furthermore, the information may also provide a template for understanding the determinants of COVID-19–induced tissue fibrosis that may follow resolution of acute infection (so-called “long COVID”), which represents a major new challenge to our healthcare systems.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that began spreading globally in late 2019. While most cases of COVID-19 present with mild to moderate symptoms, COVID-19 was the third leading cause of mortality in the United States in 2020 and 2021. Though COVID-19 affects individuals of all races and ethnicities, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations are facing an inequitable burden of COVID-19 characterized by an increased risk for hospitalization and mortality. Importantly, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx adults have also faced a greater risk of non-COVID-19-related mortality (e.g., from cardiovascular disease/CVD) during the pandemic. Contributors to the racial disparities in morbidity and mortality during the pandemic are multi-factorial as we discuss in our companion article on social determinants of health. However, profound racial variation in the prevalence of CVD and metabolic diseases may serve as a key driver of worse COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related health outcomes among racial and ethnic minority groups. Within this review, we provide data emphasizing the inequitable burden of CVD and metabolic diseases among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations. We also discuss the pathophysiology of these conditions, with a focus on how aberrant physiological alterations in the context of CVD and metabolic diseases manifest to increase susceptibility to severe COVID-19.

AB  - Background
Vaccine induced immune mediated thrombocytopenia or VITT, is a recent and rare phenomenon of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, frequently including cerebral venous thromboses (CVT), that has been described following vaccination with adenovirus vaccines ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 (AstraZeneca) and Ad26.COV2·S Johnson and Johnson (Janssen/J&J). The evaluation and management of suspected cases of CVT post COVID-19 vaccination are critical skills for a broad range of healthcare providers.
Methods
A collaborative comprehensive review of literature was conducted among a global group of expert neurologists and hematologists.
Findings
Strategies for rapid evaluation and treatment of the CVT in the context of possible VITT exist, including inflammatory marker measurements, PF4 assays, and non-heparin anticoagulation.

AB  - Summary
Although the global COVID-19 pandemic response was quick to develop medical countermeasures, it failed to fully prevent morbidity and mortality in high-income countries and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). As new variants and post-COVID-19 condition continue to emerge and affect health systems and economies, the full human and economic cost is yet to be felt. We should now learn from these shortcomings and implement more inclusive and equitable frameworks to prevent and respond to outbreaks. This Series offers specific learnings from COVID-19 vaccination campaigns and non-pharmaceutical interventions, highlighting the need for resilient, inclusive, and equitable health systems. Taking action to rebuild trust and invest in resilient local manufacturing capacity, supply chains, regulatory frameworks, and placing LMIC voices at the centre of decision making will help to ensure preparedness for future threats. It is time to move beyond mere talk of learning and implementing lessons and instead take action towards a more resilient future.

AB  - Background and aim
The pandemic of COVID-19 has put forward the public health system across countries to prepare themselves for the unprecedented outbreak of the present time. Recognition of the associated risks of morbidity and mortality becomes not only imperative but also fundamental to determine the prevention strategies as well as targeting the high-risk populations for appropriate therapies.
Methods
We reviewed, collated and analysed the online database i.e. Pubmed, Google scholar, Researchgate to highlight the demographic and mechanistic link between obesity and associated risks of severity in COVID-19.
Results
We observed a changing dynamic in the reporting from the time of initial pandemic in China to currently reported research. While, initially body mass index (BMI) did not find a mention in the data, it is now clearly emerging that obesity is one of the profound risk factors for complications of COVID-19.
Conclusion
Our review will help clinicians and health policy makers in considering the importance of obesity in making the prevention and therapeutic strategies of COVID-19. An extra attention and precaution for patients with obesity in COVID-19 pandemic is recommended.

AB  - Summary
We develop a model to retrospectively evaluate age-dependent counterfactual vaccine allocation strategies against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To estimate the effect of allocation on the expected severe-case incidence, we employ a simulation-assisted causal modeling approach that combines a compartmental infection-dynamics simulation, a coarse-grained causal model, and literature estimates for immunity waning. We compare Israel’s strategy, implemented in 2021, with counterfactual strategies such as no prioritization, prioritization of younger age groups, or a strict risk-ranked approach; we find that Israel’s implemented strategy was indeed highly effective. We also study the impact of increasing vaccine uptake for given age groups. Because of its modular structure, our model can easily be adapted to study future pandemics. We demonstrate this by simulating a pandemic with characteristics of the Spanish flu. Our approach helps evaluate vaccination strategies under the complex interplay of core epidemic factors, including age-dependent risk profiles, immunity waning, vaccine availability, and spreading rates.

AB  - Rare cases of unusual thrombosis and thrombocytopenia after administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca) have been reported. The unusual symptoms are called vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). In the present study, a brief background about cases of unusual thrombosis and thrombocytopenia after administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was provided. In addition, a description of a case of a 66-year-old woman who had received this vaccine and developed VITT was done. She presented to the hospital complaining of hematomas in the right upper limb 14 days after the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, without a history of trauma (Glasgow coma scale of 14) and thrombocytopenia even though signs of thrombosis were absent. Cranium computed tomography scan indicated intraparenchymal hematoma and cerebral thrombosis, besides anastomotic Labbé vein thrombosis. The woman received platelets transfusion, dexamethasone, and neuroprotection measures, but even so, on the twelfth postoperative day, she died of cerebral rebleeding. In conclusion, it is crucial to point out the immuno-hypersensitivity mechanisms associated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine reactions, helping to reduce their occurrences and reinforcing confidence in vaccine administration.

AB  - The pandemic COVID-19 presents a major challenge to identify effective drugs for treatment. Clinicians need evidence based on randomized trials regarding effective medical treatments for this infection. Currently no effective therapies exist for the progression of the mild forms to severe disease. Knowledge however is rapidly expanding. Remdesivir, an anti- retroviral agent has in vitro activity against this virus and has shown to decrease the duration of ICU care in patients with severe disease, while low dose dexamethasone also showed a decrease in the duration of stay in cases of severe disease requiring assisted ventilation. At the time of writing this article, two mRNA-based vaccines have shown an approximate 95 % efficacy in preventing infection in large clinical trials. At least one of these drugs has regulatory permission for vaccination in high-income countries. Low and middle-income countries may have difficulties in initiating vaccine programs on large scales because of availability, costs, refrigeration and dissemination. Adequately powered randomized trials are required for drugs with in vitro activity against the virus. Supportive care should be provided for stable, hypoxia and pneumonia free patients on imaging. Vaccines are of obvious benefit and given the preliminary evidence of the efficacy of over 95 %, Low and middle-income countries must develop links with the WHO COVAX program to ensure global distribution of vaccines.

AB  - The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is yet to be controlled worldwide, especially in India. The second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) led to panic and confusion in India, owing to the overwhelming number of the population that fell prey to this highly infectious virus of recent times. In the second wave of COVID-19, the patients had to fight both the virus and opportunistic infections triggered by fungi and bacteria. Repeated use of steroids, antibiotics, and oxygen masks during the management of severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients nurtured opportunistic infections such as mucormycosis. Despite mucormycosis being a decades-old disease, it has gained notice of its widespread occurrence in COVID-19 patients throughout India. Instances of mucormycosis are usually unearthed in immunocompromised individuals and are caused by the inhalation of filamentous fungi, either from the natural environment or through supportive care units. In the recent outbreak during the second wave of COVID-19 in India, it has been seen to cause secondary infection as it grows along with the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients with comorbidities such as diabetes were more likely to have the mucormycosis co-infection because of their challenged immune systems’ inability to fight it. Despite the hype, mucormycosis still remains neglected and least studied, which is predominantly due to all focus on diagnostics, vaccine, and therapeutic research. In this review, we emphasize mainly on the association of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients. We also present the molecular mechanism of mucormycosis for a better understanding of the fungal infections in patients who have recently been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Better understanding of fungal pathogens, immediate diagnosis, and management of the infections are crucial in COVID-19 patients, as high mortalities have been recorded in co-infected patients despite recovery from COVID-19.

AB  - Introduction
People of lower socioeconomic position and people of color experience higher risks of severe COVID-19, but understanding of these associations beyond the effect of underlying health conditions is limited. Moreover, few studies have focused on young adults, who have had the highest incidence of COVID-19 during much of the pandemic.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data from the University of Washington Medicine healthcare system. Our study population included individuals aged 18–39 years who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from February 2020 to March 2021. Using regression modeling, we estimated adjusted risk ratios and adjusted risk differences of COVID-19 hospitalization by socioeconomic position (measured by health insurance status) and race and ethnicity. We adjusted for any underlying health condition to examine these associations beyond the effect of underlying health conditions.
Results
Among 3,101 individuals, the uninsured/publicly insured had a 1.9-fold higher risk of hospitalization (adjusted risk ratio=1.9, 95% CI=1.0, 3.6) and 9 additional hospitalizations per 1,000 SARS-CoV-2–positive persons (adjusted risk difference=9, 95% CI= −1, 20) than the privately insured. Hispanic or Latine, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander patients had a 1.5-, 2.7-, 1.4-, and 2.1-fold higher risk of hospitalization (adjusted risk ratio=1.5, 95% CI=0.7, 3.1; 2.7, 95% CI=1.1, 6.5; 1.4, 95% CI=0.6, 3.3; and 2.1, 95% CI=0.5, 9.1), respectively, than non-Hispanic White patients.
Conclusions
Although they should be interpreted cautiously given low precision, our findings suggest that the increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization among young adults of lower socioeconomic position and young adults of color may be driven by forces other than underlying health conditions, including social determinants of health.

AB  - The current coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19, is the third outbreak of disease caused by the coronavirus family, after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is an acute infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This severe disease is characterised by acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Currently, no drugs or vaccines exist against the disease and the only course of treatment is symptom management involving mechanical ventilation, immune suppressants, and repurposed drugs. The severe form of the disease has a relatively high mortality rate. The last six months have seen an explosion of information related to the host receptors, virus transmission, virus structure-function relationships, pathophysiology, co-morbidities, immune response, treatment and the most promising vaccines. This review takes a critically comprehensive look at various aspects of the host-pathogen interaction in COVID-19. We examine the genomic aspects of SARS-CoV-2, modulation of innate and adaptive immunity, complement-triggered microangiopathy, and host transmission modalities. We also examine its pathophysiological impact during pregnancy, in addition to emphasizing various gaps in our knowledge. The lessons learnt from various clinical trials involving repurposed drugs have been summarised. We also highlight the rationale and likely success of the most promising vaccine candidates.

AB  - COVID-19 has caused unprecedented disruptions to American society, yet the ramifications have exhibited a pronounced impact for racial/ethnic minority adolescents and their families. Alongside upheavals to social and learning environments, minoritized youth have navigated disproportionate health and socioeconomic challenges within their families in addition to amplified racial tensions. As a result, the pandemic has disparately impacted racial/ethnic minorities. In this review, we synthesize studies of the pandemic to describe the hardships faced by racial/ethnic minority families and adolescents, their reverberation on dimensions of well-being, and the assets which buttress their welfare in the midst of COVID-19. It is imperative that future pandemic response efforts aid the most vulnerable, particularly communities of color, to ensure equitable welfare and post-pandemic recovery.

AB  - As of May 2022, there have been more than 527 million infections with severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and over 6.2 million deaths from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. COVID-19 is a multisystem illness with important neurologic consequences that impact long-term morbidity and mortality. In the acutely ill, the neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 can include distressing but relatively benign symptoms such as headache, myalgias, and anosmia; however, entities such as encephalopathy, stroke, seizures, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barre Syndrome can cause neurologic injury and resulting disability that persists long after the acute pulmonary illness. Furthermore, as many as one-third of patients may experience persistent neurologic symptoms as part of a Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Neuro-PASC) syndrome. This Neuro-PASC syndrome can affect patients who required hospitalization for COVID-19 or patients who did not require hospitalization and who may have had minor or no pulmonary symptoms. Given the large number of individuals affected and the ability of neurologic complications to impair quality of life and productivity, the neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 are likely to have major and long-lasting personal, public health, and economic consequences. While knowledge of disease mechanisms and therapies acquired prior to the pandemic can inform us on how to manage patients with the neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, there is a critical need for improved understanding of specific COVID-19 disease mechanisms and development of therapies that target the neurologic morbidities of COVID-19. This current perspective reviews evidence for proposed disease mechanisms as they inform the neurologic management of COVID-19 in adult patients while also identifying areas in need of further research.

AB  - We present a new concept, Punt Politics, and apply it to the COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) in two epicenters of the pandemic: Mexico and Brazil. Punt Politics refers to national leaders in federal systems deferring or deflecting responsibility for health systems decision-making to sub-national entities without evidence or coordination. The fragmentation of authority and overlapping functions in federal, decentralized political systems make them more susceptible to coordination problems than centralized, unitary systems. We apply the concept to pandemics, which require national health system stewardship, using sub-national NPI data that we developed and curated through the Observatory for the Containment of COVID-19 in the Americas to illustrate Punt Politics in Mexico and Brazil. Both countries suffer from protracted, high levels of COVID-19 mortality and inadequate pandemic responses, including little testing and disregard for scientific evidence. We illustrate how populist leadership drove Punt Politics and how partisan politics contributed to disabling an evidence-based response in Mexico and Brazil. These cases illustrate the combination of decentralization and populist leadership that is most conducive to punting responsibility. We discuss how Punt Politics reduces health system functionality, providing lessons for other countries and future pandemic responses, including vaccine rollout.

AB  - Background & aims
Greater COVID-19 related mortality has been reported among persons with various non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We performed an ecological study to determine the association of state-level cases and deaths with NCD risk factors and healthcare and social indices.
Methods
We obtained cumulative national and state-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths from publicly available database www.covid19india.org from February to end November 2020. To identify association with major NCD risk factors, NCDs, healthcare related and social variables we obtained data from public sources. Association was determined using univariate and multivariate statistics.
Results
More than 9.5 million COVID-19 cases and 135,000 deaths have been reported in India towards end of November 2020. There is significant positive correlation (Pearson r) of state-level COVID-19 cases and deaths per million, respectively, with NCD risk factors- obesity (0.64, 0.52), hypertension (0.28, 0.16), diabetes (0.66, 0.46), NCD epidemiological transition index (0.58, 0.54) and ischemic heart disease mortality (0.22, 0.33). Correlation is also observed with indices of healthcare access and quality (0.71, 0.61), urbanization (0.75, 0.73) and human (0.61, 0.56) and sociodemographic (0.70, 0.69) development. Multivariate adjusted analyses shows strong correlation of COVID-19 burden and deaths with NCD risk factors (r2 = 0.51, 0.43), NCDs (r2 = 0.32, 0.16) and healthcare (r2 = 0.52, 0.38).
Conclusions
COVID-19 disease burden and mortality in India is ecologically associated with greater state-level burden of NCDs and risk factors, especially obesity and diabetes.

AB  - The potential emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants capable of escaping vaccine-generated immune responses poses a looming threat to vaccination efforts and will likely prolong the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the prevalence of beta coronaviruses circulating in animals and the precedent they have set in jumping into human populations indicates that they pose a continuous threat for future pandemics. Currently, only one therapeutic is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in treating COVID-19, remdesivir, although other therapies are authorized for emergency use due to this pandemic being a public health emergency. In this review, twenty-four different treatments are discussed regarding their use against COVID-19 and any potential future coronavirus-associated illnesses. Their traditional use, mechanism of action against COVID-19, and efficacy in clinical trials are assessed. Six treatments evaluated are shown to significantly decrease mortality in clinical trials, and ten treatments have shown some form of clinical efficacy.

AB  - Background
It has been hypothesised that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine may afford cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 which may contribute to the wide variability in disease severity of Covid-19.
Methods
We employed a test negative case-control study, utilising a recent measles outbreak during which many healthcare workers received the MMR vaccine, to investigate the potential protective effect of MMR against SARS-CoV-2 in 5905 subjects (n = 805 males, n = 5100 females).
Results
The odds ratio for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, in recently MMR-vaccinated compared to not recently MMR-vaccinated individuals was 0.91 (95% CI 0.76, 1.09). An interaction analysis showed a significant interaction for sex. After sex-stratification, the odds ratio for testing positive for males was 0.43 (95% CI 0.24, 0.79, P = 0.006), and 1.01 (95% CI 0.83, 1.22, P = 0.92) for females.
Conclusion
Our results indicate that there may be a protective effect of the MMR vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in males but not females.

Outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in long-term care facilities are associated with mortality, although vaccination have contributed to improvements. This study reports clinical impacts of a COVID-19 outbreak in a nursing home for elderly individuals in Kyoto City, Japan.
Methods
We performed epidemiologic and molecular investigations of the outbreak and characterized outcomes of the nursing home residents.
Results
During the outbreak period, a total of 31 residents (39.2%) and 26 staff members (49.1%) were infected with COVID-19. All residents and staff received two doses of a vaccine approximately 7 months prior. Ten residents with severe hypoxemia could not be transferred to a hospital due to a shortage of beds for COVID-19 patients. Within 90 days of the onset of the outbreak, 8 residents with COVID-19 (25.8%) died. A total of 48.4% of residents with COVID-19 developed 1 or more comorbidities. Viral genome analysis showed that the outbreak was caused by the Omicron BA.1.1.2 variant.
Conclusions
Despite vaccination, high mortality and morbidity were observed in the COVID-19 outbreak due to the Omicron variant. Limiting medical care for residents with COVID-19 in facilities that experience ongoing outbreaks may be needed to reduce the risk of mortality among nursing home residents.

AB  - This study estimates cumulative infection rates from Covid-19 in Great Britain by local authority districts (LADs) and council areas (CAs) and investigates spatial patterns in infection rates. We propose a model-based approach to calculate cumulative infection rates from data on observed and expected deaths from Covid-19. Our analysis of mortality data shows that 7% of people in Great Britain were infected by Covid-19 by the last third of June 2020. It is unlikely that the infection rate was lower than 4% or higher than 15%. Secondly, England had higher infection rates than Scotland and especially Wales, although the differences between countries were not large. Thirdly, we observed a substantial variation in virus infection rates in Great Britain by geographical units. Estimated infection rates were highest in the capital city of London where between 11 and 12% of the population might have been infected and also in other major urban regions, while the lowest were in small towns and rural areas. Finally, spatial regression analysis showed that the virus infection rates increased with the increasing population density of the area and the level of deprivation. The results suggest that people from lower socioeconomic groups in urban areas (including those with minority backgrounds) were most affected by the spread of coronavirus from March to June.

AB  - Since 2019, the coronavirus outbreak has caused many catastrophic events all over the world. At the current time, the massive vaccination has been considered as the most efficient way to fight against the pandemic. This study schemes to explain and model COVID-19 cases by considering the vaccination rate. We utilized an amalgamation of neural network (NN) with two powerful optimization algorithms, i.e., firefly algorithm and artificial bee colony. For validating the models, we employed the COVID-19 datasets regarding the vaccination rate and the total confirmed cases for 51 states since the beginning of vaccination in the US. The numerical experiment indicated that by considering the vaccinated population, the accuracy of NN increases exponentially when compared with the same NN in the absence of the vaccinated population. During the next stage, the NN with vaccinated input data is elected for firefly and bee optimizing. Based upon the firefly optimizing, 93.75% of COVID-19 cases can be explained in all states. According to the bee optimizing, 92.3% of COVID-19 cases is explained since the massive vaccination. Overall, it can be concluded that the massive vaccination is the key predictor of COVID-19 cases on a grand scale.

AB  - Contact tracing is an important tool in managing infectious disease outbreaks and Ireland used a comprehensive contact tracing program to slow the spread of COVID-19. Although the benefits of contact tracing seem obvious, it is difficult to estimate the actual impact contact tracing has on an outbreak because it is hard to separate the effects of contact tracing from other behavioural changes or interventions. To understand the impact contact tracing had in Ireland, we used an agent-based model that is designed to simulate the spread of COVID-19 through Ireland. The model uses real contact tracing data from the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that without contact tracing, and everything else held constant, a larger number of cases, hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths would have occurred. The model suggests that without contact tracing deaths from COVID-19 in Ireland during the first year of the pandemic could have increased by 80% (this equates to approximately 5,768 agents in the model). This modelling study is an important step in highlighting the impact that contact tracing had on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we use a model for Ireland, this method is applicable to any country or region.

AB  - Background
Vaccine-associated anaphylaxis is a rare event (1.34 events/million doses; 0.00017% occurrence over 26 years). Several reports of allergic reactions concerning for anaphylaxis have been reported early into the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine campaign in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
Objective
To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis characterizing the risks of COVID-19 versus vaccine anaphylaxis, comparing universal COVID-19 vaccination versus risk-stratified vaccination approaches.
Methods
Cohort analysis models were created to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination versus risk-stratified vaccination (eg, contraindicated in persons with a history of any previous episode of anaphylaxis) with a threshold for cost-effective care at $10,000,000 per death prevented. In the base case, risk of anaphylaxis was estimated at 0.1%, with case-fatality estimated at 0.3%.
Results
On a population level (n = 300,000,000 simulated persons), universal vaccination was associated with a cost-savings of $503,596,316 and saved 7,607 lives, but the cost-savings was sensitive to increasing rates of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis. The universal strategy dominated at higher rates of COVID-19 infection and low rates of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis in both the health care and societal perspectives. When the risk of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis exceeded 0.8%, the risk-stratified approach to vaccination was the most cost-effective strategy. There was also an interaction between anaphylaxis risk and anaphylaxis fatality, with a risk-stratified approach becoming cost-effective as each risk increased concurrently. Stratified observation time by anaphylaxis history (15 minutes vs 30 minutes) was not cost-effective until a 1% anaphylaxis case-fatality was assumed and risk of vaccine anaphylaxis exceeded 6%.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that unless vaccine anaphylaxis rates exceed 0.8%, a universal vaccination approach dominates a risk-stratified approach where persons with any history of anaphylaxis would be contraindicated from vaccination, with lower cost and superior health outcomes.

KW  - residential aged care facilities
AB  - Objectives
During the COVID-19 pandemic, no country with widespread community transmission has avoided outbreaks or deaths in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). As RACF residents are at high risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, understanding disease severity risk factors is imperative.
Design
This retrospective cohort study aimed to compare COVID-19 disease severity (hospitalization and deaths) and associated risk factors among RACF residents in Victoria, Australia, across Delta and Omicron epidemic periods.
Settings and Participants
Resident case hospitalization risk (HR) and case fatality risk (CFR) were assessed using Victorian RACFs COVID-19 outbreaks data across 2 epidemic periods; Delta, 994 resident cases linked to 86 outbreaks; and Omicron, 1882 resident cases linked to 209 outbreaks.
Methods
Adjusting for outbreak-level clustering, age, sex, up-to-date vaccination status, and time since last vaccination, the odds of hospitalization and death were compared using mixed effects logistic regression.
Results
The HR and CFR was lower during the Omicron period compared with the Delta period [HR 8.2% vs 24.6%, odds ratio (OR) 0.17, 95% CI 0.11-0.26, and CFR: 11.4% vs 18.7%, OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.28-0.56]. During both periods, males had higher odds of hospitalization and odds of death; being up to date with vaccination reduced odds of hospitalization by 40% (excluding nonemergency patient transfers) and odds of death by 43%; and for each month since last vaccination, odds of hospitalization increased by 9% and odds of death by 16%.
Conclusions and Implications
This study provides empirical evidence of lower COVID-19 severity among RACF residents in the Omicron period and highlights the importance of up-to-date and timely vaccination to reduce disease severity in this cohort.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Purpose
To determine the association of social factors with Covid-19 mortality and identify high-risk clusters.
Methods
Data on Covid-19 deaths across 3,108 contiguous U.S. counties from the Johns Hopkins University and social determinants of health (SDoH) data from the County Health Ranking and the Bureau of Labor Statistics were fitted to Bayesian semi-parametric spatiotemporal Negative Binomial models, and 95% credible intervals (CrI) of incidence rate ratios (IRR) were used to assess the associations. Exceedance probabilities were used for detecting clusters.
Results
As of October 31, 2020, the median mortality rate was 40.05 per 100, 000. The monthly urban mortality rates increased with unemployment (IRRadjusted:1.41, 95% CrI: 1.24, 1.60), percent Black population (IRRadjusted:1.05, 95% CrI: 1.04, 1.07), and residential segregation (IRRadjusted:1.03, 95% CrI: 1.02, 1.04). The rural monthly mortality rates increased with percent female population (IRRadjusted: 1.17, 95% CrI: 1.11, 1.24) and percent Black population (IRRadjusted:1.07 95% CrI:1.06, 1.08). Higher college education rates were associated with decreased mortality rates in rural and urban counties. The dynamics of exceedance probabilities detected the shifts of high-risk clusters from the Northeast to Southern and Midwestern counties.
Conclusions
Spatiotemporal analyses enabled the inclusion of unobserved latent risk factors and aid in scientifically grounded decision-making at a granular level.

AB  - In order to reduce the burden on healthcare systems and to support differential diagnosis with COVID-19, influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations were strongly recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in vulnerable groups. However, no univocal and conclusive evidence on the relationship between influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations and COVID‐19 outcomes exists. We evaluated the association between such vaccinations, COVID-19 hospitalization, intensive care unit admissions and deaths in a cohort (N = 741) of COVID-19 patients who had access to the emergency room of a large Italian University hospital between March 1, 2020 and June 1, 2020. Results show that influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations did not affect hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and deaths in COVID-19 patients in the overall sample and in those ≥65 years. The same pattern of results was confirmed considering timing of influenza vaccine administration, vaccination type, and number of uptakes in the last five vaccination campaigns. In conclusion, our study does not support an impact of influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations on COVID-19 outcomes.

AB  - The traditional health economic analysis is limited to estimating the impact on the treated patient. As vaccines are usually aimed at preventing infectious diseases, they may be associated with additional values for the non-treated wider population. Although there are valid reasons for treating vaccines differently, and a wide support for a broader perspective in the literature (i.e., beyond the net costs and health gain related to the outcome for the vaccinated individual), it remains unclear to what extent the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) agencies accept and apply a broader perspective. The purpose of this study is to examine and discuss what type of consequences are relevant for a health economic analysis of vaccines and which consequences are considered by HTA agencies. The study includes a strategic review of literature and HTA decisions in Sweden and other countries, online round-table discussions with stakeholders in Sweden, and a basic estimation of the value of a COVID-19 vaccination in Sweden. The study shows that, other than herd effect, broader economic consequences for the population are generally not included in the economic evaluation of vaccines. Also, all economic consequences for the treated patient (production loss) and caregiver (health loss) are not always considered. The perspective chosen can have a major impact on the outcome of the analysis. A vaccine for COVID-19 is estimated to provide a value of €744–€956 per dose when using a societal perspective including broader consequences for the population. Providing a complete and appropriate picture of the value of vaccination is of importance to allocate resources efficiently, to provide incentives for vaccine development, and to show the cost of delaying decisions to implement a new vaccine.

AB  - Objectives
This study aimed to estimate the burden of acute COVID-19 in Córdoba, one of the most affected departments (states) in Colombia, through the estimation of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
Methods
DALYs were estimated based on the number of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection cases reported by official Colombian sources. A transition probability matrix among severity states was calculated using data obtained from a retrospective cohort that included 1736 COVID-19 confirmed subjects living in Córdoba.
Results
Córdoba had 120.23 deaths per 100 000 habitants during the study period (March 2020 to April 2021). Estimated total DALYs were 49 243 (2692 DALYs per 100 000 inhabitants), mostly attributed to fatal cases (99.7%). On average, 25 years of life were lost because of death by this infection. A relevant proportion of years of life lost because of COVID-19 (46.6%) was attributable to people < 60 years old and was greater in men. People ≥ 60 years old showed greater risk of progression to critical state than people between the age of 35 and 60 years (hazard ratio 2.5; 95% confidence interval 2.5-12.5) and younger than 35 years (9.1; 95% confidence interval 4.0-20.6).
Conclusion
In Córdoba, premature mortality because of COVID-19 was substantially represented by people < 60 years old and was greater in males. Our data may be representative of Latin American populations with great infection spread during the first year of the pandemic and contribute to novel methodological aspects and parameter estimations that may be useful to measure COVID-19 burden in other countries of the region.
Resumen
Objetivos
Estimar la carga de COVID-19 aguda en Córdoba, uno de los departamentos (estados) más afectados de Colombia, a través de la estimación de años de vida ajustados por discapacidad (AVISAS).
Métodos
Los AVISAS se estimaron con base en el número de casos de infección por severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reportados por fuentes oficiales colombianas. Se calculó una matriz de probabilidad de transición entre estados de gravedad a partir de los datos obtenidos de una cohorte retrospectiva que incluyó a 1.736 sujetos confirmados con COVID-19 residentes en Córdoba.
Resultados
Córdoba tuvo 120,23 defunciones por cada 100.000 habitantes durante el periodo de estudio (marzo de 2020 a abril de 2021). Los AVISAS totales estimados fueron 49.243 (2.692 AV por 100.000 habitantes), en su mayoría atribuidos a los casos mortales (99,7%). En promedio, se perdieron 25 años de vida debido a las muertes secundarias a esta infección. Una proporción relevante de años de vida perdidos a causa de la COVID-19 (46,6%) fue atribuible a las personas menores de 60 años y fue mayor en los hombres. Las personas ≥ 60 años presentaron un mayor riesgo de progresión a estado crítico en comparación con las personas entre 35-60 años (hazard ratio 2,5; intervalo de confianza 95% 2,5-12,5) y menores de 35 años (9,1; intervalo de confianza 95% 4,0-20,6).
Conclusión
En Córdoba, la mortalidad prematura por COVID-19 estuvo sustancialmente representada por las personas menores de 60 años y fue mayor en el sexo masculino. Nuestros datos pueden ser representativos de poblaciones latinoamericanas con gran propagación de infecciones durante el primer año de la pandemia y aportan aspectos metodológicos novedosos para la estimación de parámetros que pueden ser útiles para medir la carga de COVID-19 en otros países de la región.

AB  - Utilizing population-based data from the Covid-19 phone survey (N=2,262) of the Malawi Longitudinal Study of Families and Health (MLSFH) collected during June 2nd–August 17th, 2020, we focus on the crucial role that community leadership and trust in institutions played in shaping behavioral, economic and social responses to Covid-19 in this low-income sub-Saharan African context. We argue that the effective response of Malawi to limit the spread of the virus was facilitated by the engagement of local leadership to mobilize communities to adapt and adhere to Covid-19 prevention strategies. Using linear and ordered probit models and controlling for time fixed effects, we show that village heads (VHs) played pivotal role in shaping individuals’ knowledge about the pandemic and the adoption of preventive health behaviors and were crucial for mitigating the negative economic and health consequences of the pandemic. We further show that trust in institutions is of particular importance in shaping individuals’ behavior during the pandemic, and these findings highlight the pivotal role of community leadership in fostering better compliance and adoption of public health measures essential to contain the virus. Overall, our findings point to distinctive patterns of pandemic response in a low-income sub-Saharan African rural population that emphasized local leadership as mediators of public health messages and policies. These lessons from the first pandemic wave remain relevant as in many low-income countries behavioral responses to Covid-19 will remain the primary prevention strategy for a foreseeable future.

AB  - The pandemic COVID-19 has spread widely throughout the globe and has been responsible for millions of deaths worldwide. Recently, it has been identified that there is no specific and 100% effective treatment available to manage the infection especially for the severe cases. A significant amount of research efforts and clinical trials have been undertaken globally and many more are underway to find the potential treatment option. Earlier, convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin was effectively used in the treatment of many endemic or epidemic viral infections as a part of passive immunization. In this article, we have touched upon the immunopathology of COVID-19 infection, a basic understanding of convalescent plasma, it's manufacturing as well as evaluation, and have reviewed the scientific developments focussing on the potential of convalescent plasma vis-à-vis other modalities for the management of COVID-19. The article also covers various research approaches, clinical trials conducted globally, and the clinical trials which are at various stages for exploring the efficacy and safety of the convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) to predict its future perspective to manage COVID-19.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has proven that extraordinary public health measures can pivot every aspect of society. Norms, politics, economics, and business practices rapidly responded to coordinated simultaneous policies worldwide. This begs the question of why such advancements have not yet been similarly executed to reduce the short- and long-term morbidity and mortality due to environmental destruction and climate change. This article reviews various reasons explaining the discrepancy between the policies of these two health threats, using a terror management theory lens. Exploring how anthropogenic climate change potentiated the contagion and outcomes of COVID-19, the environmental determinants of health deserve increased attention in public discourse. The industry-driven response to COVID-19 also has exacerbated preexisting health inequalities and vulnerabilities, suggesting that a just transition for climate change must not repeat some of the same mistakes taken in global pandemic measures. Finally, addressing emergency health harms in ways that create increased environmental health harms is deemed iatrogenic, displacing rather than truly treating disease. Thus, a planetary health model focused on multisolving health issues is recommended for the basis of addressing COVID-19 and other health disasters.

AB  - Since 2019, COVID-19 has triggered a renewed investigation of the urban environment and disease outbreak. While the results have been inconsistent, it has been observed that the quantity of urban green spaces (UGS) is correlated with the risk of COVID-19. However, the spatial pattern has largely been ignored, especially on the community scale. In high-density communities where it is difficult to increase UGS quantity, UGS spatial pattern could be a crucial predictive variable. Thus, this study investigated the relative contribution of quantity and spatial patterns of UGS on COVID-19 risk at the community scale using a random forest (RF) regression model based on (n = 44) communities in Wuhan. Findings suggested that 8 UGS indicators can explain 35% of the risk of COVID-19, and the four spatial pattern metrics that contributed most were core, edge, loop, and branch whereas UGS quantity contributed least. The potential mechanisms between UGS and COVID-19 are discussed, including the influence of UGS on residents’ social distance and environmental factors in the community. This study offers a new perspective on optimizing UGS for public health and sustainable city design to combat pandemics and inspire future research on the specific relationship between UGS spatial patterns and pandemics and therefore help establish mechanisms of UGS and pandemics.

AB  - Highly mutable influenza is successfully countered based on individual susceptibility and similar precision-like medicine approach should be effective against SARS-COV-2. Among predictive markers to bring precision medicine to COVID-19, circulating ACE2 has potential features being upregulated in both severe COVID-19 and predisposing comorbidities. Spike SARS-CoVs were shown to induce ADAM17-mediated shedding of enzymatic active ACE2, thus accounting for its increased activity that has also been suggested to induce positive feedback loops leading to COVID-19-like manifestations. For this reason, pre-existing ACE2 activity and inhibition of ACE2/ADAM17 zinc-metalloproteases through zinc chelating agents have been proposed to predict COVID-19 outcome before infection and to protect from COVID-19, respectively. Since most diagnostic laboratories are not equipped for enzymatic activity determination, other potential predictive markers of disease progression exploitable by diagnostic laboratories were explored. Concentrations of circulating albumin, zinc, ACE2 protein and its activity were investigated in healthy, diabetic (COVID-19-susceptible) and SARS-CoV-2-negative COVID-19 individuals. ACE2 both protein levels and activity significantly increased in COVID-19 and diabetic patients. Abnormal high levels of ACE2 characterised a subgroup (16–19%) of diabetics, while COVID-19 patients were characterised by significantly higher zinc/albumin ratios, pointing to a relative increase of albumin-unbound zinc species, such as free zinc ones. Data on circulating ACE2 levels are in line with the hypothesis that they can drive susceptibility to COVID-19 and elevated zinc/albumin ratios support the therapeutic use of zinc chelating inhibitors of ACE2/ADAM17 zinc-metalloproteases in a targeted therapy for COVID-19.

AB  - Ongoing social, economic, and political marginalization combined with racialized gender violence has sentenced Black women in the United States to disproportionate harm in the form of premature illness and death. Despite widespread recognition within the medical social sciences, public health, and social work of the health inequities that unevenly impact Black women, as a population, their suffering continues to be overlooked and marginalized in biomedical research, healthcare institutions, and health policy. This omission contributes to the naturalization and normalization of heightened morbidity and mortality of Black women. In this article, we draw from theory on necropolitics, misogynoir, and Black ecologies of care in analyzing findings from semi-structured interviews conducted between February and June 2021 with African American women (n = 16) who were experiencing a chronic health condition or caring for someone with a chronic health condition in Tucson, Arizona. Interviews explored women’s healthcare-seeking behaviors, experiences with healthcare providers, and self-care and caregiving during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest that necropolitical logics in the form of naturalization and normalization of Black women's suffering – and of the structures that render such suffering – permeated but did not entirely define women's experiences of the pandemic, including how they navigated biomedical spaces and negotiated interactions with healthcare providers, engaged in practices of care (including self-care), and perceived and made meaning of their own health statuses. We advance a Black ecologies of care framework: (1) to make visible and hold accountable necropolitical structures in tabulations of morbidity and mortality; and (2), despite the myriad harms represented in logics of necropolitics-as-usual, to foreground the life-affirming practices by women that persist nevertheless.

AB  - Background
Women with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) had worse outcomes than men prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although concomitant COVID-19 infection increases mortality risk in STEMI patients, no studies have evaluated sex differences in this context.
Methods
The North American COVID-19 STEMI registry is a prospective, multicenter registry of hospitalized STEMI patients with COVID-19 infection. We compared sex differences in clinical characteristics, presentation, management strategies, and in-hospital mortality.
Results
Among 585 patients with STEMI and COVID-19 infection, 154 (26.3%) were women. Compared to men, women were significantly older, had a higher prevalence of diabetes and stroke/transient ischemic attack, and were more likely to be on statins on presentation. Men more frequently presented with chest pain, whereas women presented with dyspnea. Women more often had STEMI without an identified culprit lesion than men (33% vs 18%, P < .001). The use of percutaneous coronary intervention was significantly higher in men, whereas medical therapy was higher in women. In-hospital mortality was 33% for women and 27% for men (P = .22).
Conclusions
In patients presenting with STEMI in the context of COVID-19, the in-hospital mortality rate was 30% and similar for men and women. Lack of an identifiable culprit lesion was common in the setting of COVID-19 for both sexes but more likely in women (1/3 of women vs 1/5 of men). Evaluation of specific underlying etiologies is underway to better define the full impact of COVID-19 on STEMI outcomes and better understand the observed sex differences.

Introduction
Two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, tozinameran/BNT162b2 (Comirnaty®, Pfizer-BioNTech) and elasomeran/mRNA-1273 (Spikevax®, Moderna), were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) at the end of 2020, less than a year after the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In France, the health authorities have requested an intensive vaccination campaign, accompanied by a reinforced and active pharmacovigilance surveillance. This surveillance and analysis of real-life data, based on spontaneous reports received by the French Network of Regional PharmacoVigilance Centers (RFCRPV), has enabled to identify numerous pharmacovigilance signals. Some of them, such as myocarditis and heavy menstrual bleeding, have been confirmed as adverse effects of these vaccines.
Method
We propose a descriptive review of the main pharmacovigilance signals identified by the RFCRPV concerning vaccines from the mRNA platform.
Results
Most pharmacovigilance signals were common to both mRNA vaccines: myocarditis, menstrual disorders, acquired haemophilia, Parsonage-Turner syndrome, rhizomelic pseudo-polyarthritis and hearing disorders. Other signals were more specific, such as arterial hypertension with tozinameran or delayed reaction site injection with elasomeran.
Conclusion
This non-exhaustive review illustrates the experience of RFCRPV in identifying and monitoring pharmacovigilance signals related to mRNA vaccines in France during the COVID-19 pandemics, and the crucial role of pharmacological and clinical expertise in this area. It also highlights the predominant contribution of spontaneous reporting in the generation of pharmacovigilance signals, particularly for serious and rare adverse events not detected before marketing.

Rates of hospitalization, mortality, and morbidity increased and racial inequities in unemployment, job benefits, and working conditions widened. This study identifies specific factors associated with the well-being of Black adults in the U.S. workforce one year into the pandemic.
Methods
Data came from the 2021 National Health Interview Survey (N = 1,984). Ordinary least squares regressions were computed to identify correlates of psychological distress and life satisfaction among Black adults in the workforce two weeks prior to the survey.
Results
Black workers experienced significant distress. Life satisfaction was particularly low among those who provided direct medical care. Having a job with paid sick leave was consistently associated with lower psychological distress. Low household food security was associated with higher psychological distress and with lower life satisfaction. Social support was positively associated with well-being.
Conclusion
These findings have important implications for health in Black communities and for recruiting and retaining Black workers in the health care system. Supporting Black physicians matters for their mental health amidst growing rates of suicide in this population. As policymakers continue to develop and legislate policies to promote recovery from the social, economic, and health consequences of the pandemic, attention to how these policies will support all Black workers is critical.

AB  - Summary
Background
The inverse care law states that disadvantaged populations need more health care than advantaged populations but receive less. Gaps in COVID-19-related health care and infection control are not well understood. We aimed to examine inequalities in health in the care cascade from testing for SARS-CoV-2 to COVID-19-related hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death in Switzerland, a wealthy country strongly affected by the pandemic.
Methods
We analysed surveillance data reported to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health from March 1, 2020, to April 16, 2021, and 2018 population data. We geocoded residential addresses of notifications to identify the Swiss neighbourhood index of socioeconomic position (Swiss-SEP). The index describes 1·27 million small neighbourhoods of approximately 50 households each on the basis of rent per m2, education and occupation of household heads, and crowding. We used negative binomial regression models to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) of the association between ten groups of the Swiss-SEP index defined by deciles (1=lowest, 10=highest) and outcomes. Models were adjusted for sex, age, canton, and wave of the epidemic (before or after June 8, 2020). We used three different denominators: the general population, the number of tests, and the number of positive tests.
Findings
Analyses were based on 4 129 636 tests, 609 782 positive tests, 26 143 hospitalisations, 2432 ICU admissions, 9383 deaths, and 8 221 406 residents. Comparing the highest with the lowest Swiss-SEP group and using the general population as the denominator, more tests were done among people living in neighbourhoods of highest SEP compared with lowest SEP (adjusted IRR 1·18 [95% CrI 1·02–1·36]). Among tested people, test positivity was lower (0·75 [0·69–0·81]) in neighbourhoods of highest SEP than of lowest SEP. Among people testing positive, the adjusted IRR was 0·68 (0·62–0·74) for hospitalisation, was 0·54 (0·43–0·70) for ICU admission, and 0·86 (0·76–0·99) for death. The associations between neighbourhood SEP and outcomes were stronger in younger age groups and we found heterogeneity between areas.
Interpretation
The inverse care law and socioeconomic inequalities were evident in Switzerland during the COVID-19 epidemic. People living in neighbourhoods of low SEP were less likely to be tested but more likely to test positive, be admitted to hospital, or die, compared with those in areas of high SEP. It is essential to continue to monitor testing for SARS-CoV-2, access and uptake of COVID-19 vaccination and outcomes of COVID-19. Governments and health-care systems should address this pandemic of inequality by taking measures to reduce health inequalities in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with various liver injury cases worldwide. To date, the prevalence, mechanism, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and outcomes of COVID-19-induced liver injury in various at-risk groups are not well defined. Liver injury may arise in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 from direct causes such as viral infection and indirect causes such as systemic inflammation, hypoxic changes, and drugs that exacerbate any pre-existing liver disease. Studies have found that patients with underlying liver disease are at higher risk of COVID-19-induced liver injury. Certain condition of cardiopulmonary and metabolic diseases and vulnerable stages in lifespan may also involve in the development of COVID-19-induced liver injury. This review summarized studies of COVID-19-induced liver injury in different at-risk groups regarding their clinical characteristics, parameters, and correlations of the severity with these indicators and signs as well as potential treatment suggestions, to increase attention to physiological and pathological conditions and continue liver function monitoring as they can help in strengthening early supportive treatment and reducing the incidence of adverse outcomes.

AB  - Summary
Background
On Dec 14, 2020, the United States initiated a nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Demonstrating clear population-level impact following vaccine introduction helps to further elucidate and quantify the public-health benefits of vaccination.
Methods
Using a negative binomial regression model we evaluated the ecological association between county-level COVID-19 vaccine uptake and rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States from April 1, 2021 through October 31, 2021 controlling for a broad set of county-level environmental, sociodemographic, economic, and health-status-related characteristics. County-level data were obtained from several publicly available databases that were merged for analysis.
Findings
After adjustment for county-level characteristics, US counties with ≥ 80% of their residents ≥ 12 years of age fully vaccinated against COVID-19 had 30% (95% CI: 25−35; P < .001) and 46% (38−52; P < .001) lower rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths, respectively, versus those with <50% coverage (reference group). A dose response was observed: counties with 70−79% uptake had 20% (95% CI: 16−24; P < .001) and 35% (29−40; P < .001) lower rates of cases and deaths, respectively; counties with 60−69% uptake had 8% (5−11; P < .001) and 20% (15−24; P < .001) lower rates; and counties with 50−59% uptake had 2% (0−4; P =.09) and 8% (4−12; P < .001) lower rates. Restricting the analysis to the period when the Delta variant was predominant (June 1, 2021 ‒ October 31, 2021) showed similar findings.
Interpretation
Our results showed that US counties with higher proportions of persons ≥ 12 years of age fully vaccinated against COVID-19 had substantially lower rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths—a finding that showed dose response and persisted even in the period when Delta was predominant.

AB  - In 2020, COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in the US, with increased hospitalizations and mortality linked to factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, higher social vulnerability, and lower socioeconomic status. These multiple factors contribute to inequities in COVID-19 outcomes, including among older persons, members of racial/ethnic populations, and persons experiencing homelessness. Perhaps the best pathway to overcome the distressing high degree of death and disability due to COVID-19 has shown to be immunization with widespread acceptance, uptake, and vaccine access. Especially in racial/ethnic communities, it is important to utilize trusted leaders to overcome common vaccine misconceptions and barriers. This commentary summarizes the keynote lecture given to the Cardiometabolic Health Congress (CMHC) addressing the intersection of social injustice, cardiovascular and cardiometabolic disparities, and increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in racial/ethnic populations in the US.

AB  - Starting from historic reflections, the current SARS-CoV-2 induced COVID-19 pandemic is examined from various perspectives, in terms of what it implies for the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, the modeling and monitoring of the epidemic, the development of early-warning systems, the study of mortality, prevalence estimation, diagnostic and serological testing, vaccine development, and ultimately clinical trials. Emphasis is placed on how the pandemic had led to unprecedented speed in methodological and clinical development, the pitfalls thereof, but also the opportunities that it engenders for national and international collaboration, and how it has simplified and sped up procedures. We also study the impact of the pandemic on clinical trials in other indications. We note that it has placed biostatistics, epidemiology, virology, infectiology, and vaccinology, and related fields in the spotlight in an unprecedented way, implying great opportunities, but also the need to communicate effectively, often amidst controversy.

AB  - Background
People with disabilities might experience worse clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but evidence is limited.
Objective
To investigate if people with disabilities requiring assistance are more likely to experience severe COVID-19 or death.
Methods
Data from the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Precision Medicine Analytics Platform Registry (JH-CROWN) included 6494 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted between March 4, 2020–October 29, 2021. Severe COVID-19 and death were defined using the occurrence and timing of clinical events. Assistive needs due to disabilities were reported by patients or their proxies upon admission. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations between disability status and severe COVID-19 or death. Primary models adjusted for demographics and secondary models additionally adjusted for clinical covariates.
Results
In this clinical cohort (47–73 years, 49% female, 39% Black), patients with disabilities requiring assistance had 1.35 times (95% confidence interval [CI]:1.01, 1.81) the hazard of severe COVID-19 among patients <65 years, but not among those ≥65 years, equating to an additional 17.5 severe COVID-19 cases (95% CI:7.7, 28.2) per 100 patients. A lower risk of mortality was found among patients <65 years, but this finding was not robust due to the small number of deaths.
Conclusions
People with disabilities requiring assistance aged <65 years are more likely to develop severe COVID-19. Although our study is limited by using a medical model of disability, these analyses intend to further our understanding of COVID-19 outcomes among people with disabilities. Also, standardized disability data collection within electronic health records is needed.

AB  - Summary
Shigellosis causes considerable public health burden, leading to excess deaths as well as acute and chronic consequences, particularly among children living in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Several Shigella vaccine candidates are advancing in clinical trials and offer promise. Although multiple target populations might benefit from a Shigella vaccine, the primary strategic goal of WHO is to accelerate the development and accessibility of safe, effective, and affordable Shigella vaccines that reduce mortality and morbidity in children younger than 5 years living in LMICs. WHO consulted with regulators and policy makers at national, regional, and global levels to evaluate pathways that could accelerate regulatory approval in this priority population. Special consideration was given to surrogate efficacy biomarkers, the role of controlled human infection models, and the establishment of correlates of protection. A field efficacy study in children younger than 5 years in LMICs is needed to ensure introduction in this priority population.

AB  - Background
Although elderly people are at a huge risk of mortality due to COVID-19, the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in hospitalized elderly patients is poorly investigated. This meta-analysis and meta-regression aimed to generate pooled CFR due to COVID-19 in hospitalized elderly patients by sex, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), year, and continent and also to explain the potential source of the heterogeneity and variations in the pooled estimation of COVID-19 CFR.
Methods
We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Embase up to 31 July 2022. Eligibility assessment of records was performed independently in a blinded, standardized way by two reviewers. Meta-analysis and Meta-regression analysis were carried out to estimate pooled CFR and the potential sources of the heterogeneity.
Results
The study included 5683 confirmed hospitalized elderly COVID-19 patients, 1809 deaths, and 19 original articles from 10 countries. The pooled estimate of the overall CFR, and by male and female sexes were 29%, 34%, and 24%, respectively. We found CFR was decreased by increasing female sex proportion, GDP, and year of publication. Multivariate meta-regression analysis indicated that the age and sex of patients, continent, GDP, and year of the publication together explained the majority of the heterogeneity and variations in the pooled estimate of the hospitalized elderly COVID-19 CFR.
Conclusions
This review provided reliable pooled CFR measures for hospitalized elderly patients with COVID-19. Although COVID-19 fatality has decreased in hospitalized elderly patients over time, it is still high in hospitalized elderly patients and needs advanced treatment support.

AB  - As of 6 June 2022, a sum 25,782 of active cases and 524,701 deaths due to Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) have been recorded in India. Stewing in the flares of the pandemic, Kerala is entwined in the wrath of multiple emerging infectious diseases. India, a home to 1.3 billion people, recently faced a devastating second wave of COVID-19 during May of 2021, with a ruckus of chronic shortage of medicine, oxygen supplies, ventilators, besides, being challenged by secondary infections and chronic health ailments. The state of Kerala, alone contributes to 50% COVID-19 caseload, besides, recent simultaneous outbreaks of Zika Virus Disease (ZVD), Nipah Virus Disease (NiVD) and Kala-azar (black fever) on July 8, September 5 and 8, 2021 respectively. Syndemicity and a high case fatality rates of these highly contagious diseases coupled with post infection sequelae, overwhelm the already fragile healthcare system. Thus, these lethal infectious diseases along with an anticipated third wave of COVID-19 pose a serious public health threat in and around South India. With this narrative review, we aim to discuss the challenges that the emergence of intersecting outbreaks of Zika, Nipah, Kala-azar presents with, in the nation, amidst the global pandemic of COVID-19 and provide recommendations so as to help alleviate the situation. The syndemicity of COVID-19 with other infectious diseases, calls for adequate surveillance and monitoring of diseases’ outbreaks. To avoid the worst situations like pandemic, the health ministry, public and private health stakeholders in India should strengthen the public healthcare delivery system and providence of quick medical facilities to control the rate of mortality and morbidity during outbreaks.

AB  - Obesity and type 2 diabetes are major factors in COVID-19 causing a progression to excessive morbidity and mortality. An important characteristic of these conditions is poor glycaemic control leading to inappropriate chemical reactions and the production of glycated proteins in which positively charged lysine and arginine residues are neutralised. We propose that this protein glycation primes the inflammatory system as the presence of aspartate and glutamate residues in any glycated zwitterionic protein will thus increase its anionic characteristics. As a result, these macromolecules will be recognised by the innate immune system and identified as originating from infection or cell damage (sterile inflammation). Many proteins in the body exist to non-specifically target these anionic macromolecules and rely heavily on positively charged (cationic) binding-sites to produce a relatively non-specific interaction as the first step in the body’s response. Proteins involved in this innate immunity are collectively referred to as damage associated molecular pattern molecules or pathogen associated molecular pattern molecules. A crucial player in this process is RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products). RAGE plays a central role in the inflammatory response and on ligand binding stimulates many aspects of inflammation including the production of the key inflammatory mediator NF-κB, and the subsequent production of inflammatory cytokines. This process has the potential to show a positive feedback loop resulting in a dramatic response within the tissue. We propose that protein glycation primes the inflammatory system by generating negatively charged surfaces so that when a SARS-Cov-2 infection occurs within the lung the further release of negatively-charged macromolecules due to cell damage results in a potentially catastrophic inflammatory response resulting in the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. That part of the population who do not suffer from inflammatory priming (Phase 1), such as the young and the non-obese, should not be subjected to the catastrophic inflammatory response seen in others (Phase 2). This hypothesis further highlights the need for improved dietary intake to minimise the inflammatory priming resulting from poor glycaemic control.

AB  - COVID-19 is primarily classified as a respiratory disorder; however, various neurological symptoms have been reported in COVID-19 patients. Neurological manifestations may be the initial signs of COVID-19 and can develop in patients of different age groups and with or without underlying disease. COVID-19 causes a broad range of complications in the central nervous system. These include headaches, altered mental status, dizziness, seizures, cerebrovascular events, encephalitis, and other encephalopathies. Moreover, a broad spectrum of peripheral nervous system symptoms such as olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, neuropathy, visual impairments, neuralgia, cranial nerves palsy, and muscle involvement could manifest as symptoms. Despite various efforts, the exact pathogenesis of the COVID-19 neurological complications has not been clarified yet. Moreover, the reason for the development of neurological manifestation in only some COVID-19 patients has not been determined. This review focuses on the different neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19 and the possible pathological mechanisms hoping to provide new insights for diagnosis, therapies, or other forms of intervention.

AB  - Antiphospholipid syndrome and the coagulopathy of COVID-19 share many pathophysiologic features, including endotheliopathy, hypercoagulability, and activation of platelets, complement pathways, and neutrophil extracellular traps, all acting in concert via a model of immunothrombosis. Antiphospholipid antibody production in COVID-19 is common, with 50% of COVID-19 patients being positive for lupus anticoagulant in some studies, and with non-Sapporo criteria antiphospholipid antibodies being prevalent as well. The biological significance of antiphospholipid antibodies in COVID-19 is uncertain, as such antibodies are usually transient, and studies examining clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with and without antiphospholipid antibodies have yielded conflicting results. In this review, we explore the biology of antiphospholipid antibodies in COVID-19 and other infections and discuss mechanisms of thrombogenesis in antiphospholipid syndrome and parallels with COVID-19 coagulopathy. In addition, we review the existing literature on safety of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and antiphospholipid syndrome.

AB  - I analyze the human life-economic loss dilemma (HELD) trade-off between saving lives ad saving economic activities during the emergency period of Covid 19 pandemic. A new concept labeled HELD Curve, not addressed in the literature so far, is proposed to model the inverse non-linear relation between loss of economic activity and death rates during the Covid 19 Pandemic in Europe, due to the lockdown policy. Econometric estimation supports this view offering to policymakers a tool to assess the impact of continuing the lockdown. The HELD curve elasticity implies a trade-off of 218 thousand EURO per saved human life.

AB  - The involvement of viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in autoimmune diseases is well known. The recent demonstration that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Covid-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccine (ChA) favors the production of anti-platelet factor 4 (anti-PF4) antibodies, blood clots, and thrombocytopenia raises the question of whether other anti-CoViD-19 vaccines favor the same patterns of events. We assessed the frequency of severe adverse events (SAEs) documented in the EudraVigilance European database up to April 16, 2021 related to thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and blood clots in recipients of ChA compared to that of recipients of the BNT162b2 Covid-19 (Pfizer/BioNTech) vaccine (BNT). ChA administration was associated with a much higher frequency of SAEs in each AE Reaction Group as compared with that elicited by BNT. When considering AEs caused by thrombocytopenia, bleeding and blood clots, we observed 33 and 151 SAEs/1 million doses in BNT and ChA recipients, respectively. When considering patients with AEs related to cerebral/splanchnic venous thrombosis, and/or thrombocytopenia, we documented 4 and 30 SAEs and 0.4 and 4.8 deaths/1 million doses for BNT and ChA recipients, respectively. The highest risk following ChA vaccination is in young people and, likely, women of reproductive age, as suggested by hypothesized scenarios. In conclusion, the immune reaction promoted by ChA vaccine may lead to not only thrombocytopenia and cerebral/splanchnic venous thrombosis but also other thrombotic and thromboembolic SAEs. These events are not favored by BNT vaccine. Our study may help in the evaluation of the benefit/risk profile of the ChA vaccine considering the epidemic curve present in a country.

KW  - COVID-19
AB  - Pain is a common symptom reported in COVID-19 patients. Impaired endogenous pain-modulatory mechanisms such as conditioned pain modulation (CPM), and exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) have been found in chronic pain conditions but is often overlooked in acute conditions that evoke painful symptoms, such as COVID-19. The purpose was to compare pressure-pain sensitivity, CPM, and EIH function among individuals who previously had COVID-19, both symptomatically and asymptomatically, and a healthy control group. Pressure pain thresholds of 59 participants were assessed in the forearm and leg using a pressure algometer before and after 1) submersion of their dominant foot in cold water (2°C) for 1min; and 2) isometric knee extension performed to task-failure at 25% of their maximal contraction. The CPM response was attenuated in individuals who were infected with symptomatic COVID-19 (N = 26) compared to asymptomatic COVID-19 (N = 13) in arm (-1.0% ± 20.3 vs 33.3% ± 26.2; P < .001) and leg (12.8% ± 22.0 vs 33.8% ± 28.2; P = .014) and compared to controls (N = 20) in arm only (-1.0% ± 26.2 vs 23.4% ± 28.2; P = .004). The EIH response was not different between groups. CPM was impaired in individuals who had symptomatic COVID-19, which may have long-term implications on pain modulation.
Perspective
This study reveals that CPM was impaired in individuals who had symptomatic COVID-19 during the first wave of COVID-19, pre vaccine. These findings present a preliminary motive to study the long-term implications of COVID-19 and its effects on pain modulation.

AB  - Objectives
There are several retrospective studies that establish a relationship between some risk factors (cardiovascular risks mainly) and the development of COVID-19 and a severe outcome. Thus, our aim with this study is to find out the former relationship among the population within our basic health area
Method
Cohort study. The study sample consisted of 372 patients aged 14 or older who had tested positive for COVID-19 in our health centre by consecutive sampling. Data collected from medical records will be analysed using Frequencies, X2 with a Confidence interval of 95% and those carrying out the study will have prior experience/training in research and will be specifically trained for the aim of this research.
Results
A worse outcome in patients aged 76 years old on average was found versus patients aged 48.7. Regarding high blood pressure patients, X2 was <0.001 and OR between 3.975 and 21.425 with confidence interval of 95%, finding a worse outcome in these patients. With regard to Diabetes Mellitus (DM), X2 was <0.001 and OR rated between 2.766 and 12.690 with a confidence interval of 95%, also resulting in a worse outcome in these patients. No significant differences regarding a worse outcome were found in Body Mass Index, gender, or toxic habits.
Conclusions
Older patients had a worse outcome from COVID-19, as well as patients with high blood pressure or DM. We found no differences regarding gender and neither could we find any differences regarding BMI.
Resumen
Objetivos
La bibliografía consultada, en su mayoría estudios descriptivos, establece asociación entre factores de riesgo para la salud, en su mayoría cardiovasculares, y la mala evolución de la COVID-19. Este estudio pretende mostrar dicha asociación entre la población perteneciente al área de salud zona vi de Albacete (España)
Método
Estudio de cohortes de carácter retrospectivo. Mediante muestreo consecutivo se ha obtenido una muestra de 372 pacientes, mayores de 14 años, con diagnóstico confirmado de COVID-19. Los grupos se han dividido entre buena y mala evolución, entendiendo esta última como ingreso en UCI y/o muerte. Los datos obtenidos mediante la explotación de historias clínicas han sido analizados obteniendo frecuencias, Chi cuadrado con intervalo de confianza al 95% y ajustando por factores de confusión.
Resultados
Por edad los pacientes con mala evolución tenían una media de 76 años, frente a los 48,7 años de los pacientes que evolucionaron favorablemente. Los pacientes con HTA presentaron peor evolución; siendo la Chi cuadrado <0,001 y la OR, para un intervalo de confianza del 95%, estuvo entre 3,97 y 21,42. En los paciente con DM también se relacionó la mala evolución de la enfermedad, siendo la Chi cuadrado <0,001 y la OR, para un intervalo de confianza del 95%, entre 2.766 y 12.690. Los pacientes que presentaban DM + HTA tenían un riesgo 5 veces superior de mala evolución respecto a los que solo presentaban una de las enfermedades. Nuestro estudio no pudo encontrar diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre el IMC, el sexo y los hábitos tóxicos (consumo de alcohol, tabaco y drogas) y la mala evolución de la COVID-19.
Conclusiones
Los pacientes de mayor edad tuvieron un peor desenlace de la enfermedad, así como los hipertensos y diabéticos. No se encontró relación entre la evolución y la distribución por sexos. No se pudo establecer relación entre el IMC y hábitos tóxicos y la mala evolución.

AB  - Background
Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 suffer thrombotic complications. Risk factors for poor outcomes are shared with coronary artery disease.
Objectives
To investigate the efficacy of an acute coronary syndrome regimen in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and coronary disease risk factors.
Methods
A randomized controlled, open-label trial across acute hospitals (United Kingdom and Brazil) added aspirin, clopidogrel, low-dose rivaroxaban, atorvastatin, and omeprazole to standard care for 28 days. Primary efficacy and safety outcomes were 30-day mortality and bleeding. The key secondary outcome was a daily clinical status (at home, in hospital, on intensive therapy unit admission, or death).
Results
Three hundred twenty patients from 9 centers were randomized. The trial terminated early due to low recruitment. At 30 days, there was no significant difference in mortality (intervention vs control, 11.5% vs 15%; unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.38-1.41; p = .355). Significant bleeds were infrequent and were not significantly different between the arms (intervention vs control, 1.9% vs 1.9%; p > .999). Using a Bayesian Markov longitudinal ordinal model, it was 93% probable that intervention arm participants were more likely to transition to a better clinical state each day (OR, 1.46; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.88-2.37; Pr [beta > 0], 93%; adjusted OR, 1.50; 95% CrI, 0.91-2.45; Pr [beta > 0], 95%) and median time to discharge to home was 2 days shorter (95% CrI, −4 to 0; 2% probability that it was worse).
Conclusion
Acute coronary syndrome treatment regimen was associated with a reduction in the length of hospital stay without an excess in major bleeding. A larger trial is needed to evaluate mortality.

AB  - Objectives: In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore, the vast majority of infected persons were migrant workers living in dormitories who had few medical comorbidities. In 2021, with the Delta and Omicron waves, this shifted to the more vulnerable, elderly population within the local community. We examined evolving trends among the hospitalised cases of COVID-19. Methods: All patients with polymerase chain reaction-positive SARS-CoV-2 admitted from February 2020 to October 2021 were included and subsequently stratified by their year of admission (2020 or 2021). We compared the baseline clinical characteristics, clinical course, and outcomes. Results: A majority of cases were seen in 2020 (n = 1359), compared with 2021 (n = 422), due to the large outbreaks in migrant worker dormitories. Nevertheless, the greater proportion of locally transmitted cases outside of dormitories in 2021 (78.7% vs 12.3%) meant a significantly older population with more medical comorbidities had COVID-19. This led to an observably higher proportion of patients with severe disease presenting with raised inflammatory markers, need for therapeutics, supplemental oxygenation, and higher mortality. Conclusion: Changing demographics and the characteristics of the exposed populations are associated with distinct differences in clinical presentation and outcomes. Older age remained consistently associated with adverse outcomes.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a substantial stressor that is greatly impacting environmental sustainability. Besides, the different pre-existing environmental stressors and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)-related stressors are further worsening the effects of the viral disease by inducing the generation of oxidative stress. The generated oxidative stress results in nucleic acid damage associated with viral mutations, that could potentially reduce the effectiveness of COVID-19 management, including the vaccine approach. The current review is aimed to overview the impact of the oxidative stress damage induced by various environmental stressors on COVID-19. The available data regarding the COVID-19-related stressors and the effects of oxidative stress damage induced by the chronic stress, exposure to free radicals, and malnutrition are also analyzed to showcase the promising options, which could be investigated further for sustainable control of the pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to millions of deaths worldwide after its emergence in 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily affects respiratory function, but immune dysregulation leading to systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulopathy can predispose to systemic complications including hematologic and vascular complications. Treatment strategies for patients with COVID-19 have rapidly evolved and the effectiveness and safety of antithrombotic agents have been evaluated in multiple clinical trials. The findings have spurred interest in the prevention and treatment of the hematologic and vascular complications of non-COVID-19 respiratory infections. This review is focused on hematological and vascular complications of COVID-19, including their pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management. Because of the perpetually changing nature of the disease, the review places previous data in temporal contexts and outlines potential next steps for future research in COVID-19 and other severe respiratory infections.
Résumé
La pandémie de COVID-19 a entraîné des millions de décès dans le monde après son apparition en 2020. Le virus SRAS-CoV-2 qui en est responsable affecte principalement la fonction respiratoire, mais des dérèglements immunitaires menant à une inflammation généralisée, à une dysfonction endothéliale et à une coagulopathie peuvent prédisposer certaines personnes à des complications systémiques, notamment des complications hématologiques et vasculaires. Les stratégies de traitement pour les patients atteints de la COVID-19 ont évolué rapidement, et de nombreux essais cliniques ont porté sur l’efficacité et l’innocuité des agents antithrombotiques. Les conclusions ont suscité un intérêt envers la prévention et le traitement des complications hématologiques et vasculaires attribuables aux infections respiratoires autres que la COVID-19. Cette synthèse relève les complications hématologiques et vasculaires de la COVID-19, de même que leur physiopathologie, leurs manifestations cliniques et leur prise en charge. En raison de l’évolution continue de la maladie, les données précédentes sont placées dans leur contexte temporel, et des axes de recherche sur la COVID-19 et d’autres infections respiratoires graves sont proposés.

AB  - This paper presents the first longitudinal study of sex disparities in COVID-19 cases and mortalities across U.S. states, derived from the unique 13-month dataset of the U.S. Gender/Sex COVID-19 Data Tracker. To analyze sex disparities, weekly case and mortality rates by sex and mortality rate ratios were computed for each U.S. state, and a multilevel crossed-effects conditional logistic binomial regression model was fitted to estimate the variation of the sex disparity in mortality over time and across states. Results demonstrate considerable variation in the sex disparity in COVID-19 cases and mortalities over time and between states. These data suggest that the sex disparity, when present, is modest, and likely varies in relation to context-sensitive variables, which may include health behaviors, preexisting health status, occupation, race/ethnicity, and other markers of social experience.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 infection prevention measures can negatively impact nursing home residents’ well-being. Society has been concerned about the imbalance between infection prevention and residents’ well-being, and about nursing home residents’ autonomy in COVID-19 policymaking.
Objective
This study explores consensus among nursing home staff about which measures they found to be most important in contributing to preventing infections and to maintaining well-being of residents during COVID-19 outbreaks. In addition, this study explores the decision-making processes regarding COVID-19 measures and the involvement of residents or their representatives.
Design
Mixed methods based on an online nominal group technique.
Setting(s)
Dutch nursing homes, June–November 2020.
Participants
Managers, policy advisors, elderly care physicians, psychologists, a spiritual counselor, nurses, care assistants, and resident representatives (N = 35).
Methods
Four panels from the viewpoint of infection prevention, and four panels from the viewpoint of well-being were performed with 3 to 7 participants per panel. Participants individually selected the measure they found most important, discussed these measures together in an online conversation, and rated the importance and urgency of these measures during COVID-19 outbreaks on a 5-point Likert scale. The measures that were rated as (very) important and (very) urgent by all members of that panel were defined as ‘prioritized in consensus’. Panels also discussed the decision-making process regarding COVID-19 measures and the involvement of residents or their representatives. These conversations were transcribed verbatim and thematically coded using an inductive approach.
Results
The infection prevention panels prioritized isolation measures; testing measures; testing and isolation combinations; use of personal protective equipment around (suspected) infected residents; and preparation for outbreaks by COVID-19 outbreak teams. The well-being panels prioritized cohort isolation, testing combined with cohort isolation and with isolation in residents’ rooms, exceptions to visitor bans, maximum numbers of visitors, and registration and accompanying visitors to the residents’ rooms. Resident representatives and staff were dissatisfied with their reduced involvement in policy making during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, although they understood that decisions had to be made quickly.
Conclusions
Staff and resident representatives should be involved in COVID-19 policy making. According to them, priority COVID-19 measures should include: cohort isolation, testing and isolation combinations, use of personal protective equipment, crisis management by COVID-19 outbreak teams, and nursing home visit regulations and instruction of visitors. Combining these measures may be a first step towards packages of COVID-19 measures that better balance infection prevention and maintaining residents’ well-being.

AB  - Background
Post-marketing surveillance studies have raised concerns of increased myocarditis rates following coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) mRNA vaccines. The present study aims to accumulate the published mRNA Covid-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis cases, describe their clinical characteristics and determine the factors predisposing to critical illness.
Methods
Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, CENTRAL and Google Scholar were systematically searched from inception. Studies reporting adult myocarditis cases following BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccination were included. Individual participant data coming from case reports/series were pooled. Proportional random-effects meta-analysis was conducted by combining the pooled cohort and observational studies with aggregated data.
Results
Overall, 39 studies were included with a total of 129 patients. Most cases occurred in young males after the second vaccine dose. Myocarditis after the first dose was significantly associated with prior Covid-19 (p-value: 0.025). The most common electrocardiographic finding was ST-segment elevation, while late gadolinium enhancement was invariably observed in cardiac magnetic reasoning. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that signs of heart failure were predictive of subsequent critical illness (Odds ratio: 19.22, 95% confidence intervals-CI: 5.57–275.84). Proportion meta-analysis indicated that complete resolution of symptoms is achieved in 80.5% of patients (95% CI: 59.3–92.1), while the proportion of participants necessitating intensive care unit admission is 7.0% (95% CI: 3.8–12.9).
Conclusions
Myocarditis following mRNA Covid-19 vaccination is typically mild, following an uncomplicated clinical course with rapid improvement of symptoms. Future research is needed to define its exact incidence, clarify its pathophysiology and determine the optimal management plan depending on its severity.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has devastated mankind. To date, no approved treatment is available to completely combat this disease. Although many studies reported the potential of silver nanoparticles’ (AgNPs) action mechanism and effect against SARS-CoV-2, this is the first clinical trial that aimed to prove this effect. This open-label, randomized, parallel-group, investigator-initiated study (IIS) was conducted in India from 2021 to 2022 and included 40 patients diagnosed with moderately-severe to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This study proved a significantly higher survival rates (p < 0.05) and significantly lower number of days until supplemental oxygenation was required (p < 0.0001) for patients receiving intravenous AgNPs in form of AgSept® in addition to the standard COVID-19 treatment. This study highlights the importance of intravenous AgNPs administration in the treatment of virus-induced pneumonia.

AB  - Objective
The impact of obesity on long-term survival after intensive care unit (ICU) admission with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. We aimed to quantify the impact of obesity on time to death up to two years in patients admitted to Australian and New Zealand ICUs.
Design
Retrospective multicentre study.
Setting
92 ICUs between 1st January 2020 through to 31st December 2020 in New Zealand and 31st March 2022 in Australia with COVID-19, reported in the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society adult patient database.
Participants
All patients with documented height and weight to estimate the body mass index (BMI) were included. Obesity was classified patients according to the World Health Organization recommendations.
Interventions and main outcome measures
The primary outcome was survival time up to two years after ICU admission. The effect of obesity on time to death was assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Confounders were acute illness severity, sex, frailty, hospital type and jurisdiction for all patients.
Results
We examined 2,931 patients; the median BMI was 30.2 (IQR 25.6–36.0) kg/m2. Patients with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 were younger (median [IQR] age 57.7 [46.2–69.0] vs. 63.0 [50.0–73.6]; p < 0.001) than those with a BMI <30 kg/m2. Most patients (76.6%; 2,244/2,931) were discharged alive after ICU admission. The mortality at two years was highest for BMI categories <18.5 kg/m2 (35.4%) and 18.5–24.9 kg/m2 (31.1%), while lowest for BMI ≥40 kg/m2 (14.5%). After adjusting for confounders and with BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m2 category as a reference, only the BMI ≥40 kg/m2 category patients had improved survival up to 2 years (hazard ratio = 0.51; 95%CI: 0.34–0.76).
Conclusions
The obesity paradox appears to exist beyond hospital discharge in critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted in Australian and New Zealand ICUs. A BMI ≥40 kg/m2 was associated with a higher survival time of up to two years.

AB  - Several factors ranging from environmental risks to the genetics of the virus and that of the hosts, affect the spread of COVID-19. The impact of physicochemical variables on virus vitality and spread should be taken into account in experimental and clinical studies. Another avenue to explore is the effect of diet and its interaction with the immune system on SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality rate. Past year have witnessed extensive studies on virus and pathophysiology of the COVID-19 disease and the cellular mechanisms of virus spreading. However, our knowledge has not reached a level where we plan an efficient therapeutic approach to prevent the virus entry to the cells or decreasing the spreading and morbidity in severe cases of disease. The risk of infection directly correlates with the control of virus spreading via droplets and aerosol transmission, as well as patient immune system response. A key goal in virus restriction and transmission rate is to understand the physicochemical structure of aerosol and droplet formation, and the parameters that affect the droplet-borne and airborne in different environmental conditions. The lifetime of droplets on different surfaces is described based on the contact angle. Hereby, we recommend regular use of high-quality face masks in high temperature and low humidity conditions. However, in humid and cold weather conditions, wearing gloves and frequently hand washing, gain a higher priority. Additionally, social distancing rules should be respected in all aforementioned conditions. We will also discuss different routes of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells and how multiple genetic factors play a role in the spread of the virus. Given the role of environmental and nutritional factors, we discuss and recommend some strategies to prevent the disease and protect the population against COVID-19. Since an effective vaccine can prevent the transmission of communicable diseases and abolish pandemics, we added a brief review of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
