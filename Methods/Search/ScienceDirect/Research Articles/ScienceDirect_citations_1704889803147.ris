AB  - Summary
Large GWAS indicated that genetic factors influence the response to SARS-CoV-2. However, sex, age, concomitant diseases, differences in ancestry, and uneven exposure to the virus impacted the interpretation of data. We aimed to perform a GWAS of COVID-19 outcome in a homogeneous population who experienced a high exposure to the virus and with a known infection status. We recruited inhabitants of Bergamo province—that in spring 2020 was the epicenter of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic in Europe—via an online questionnaire followed by personal interviews. Cases and controls were matched by age, sex and risk factors. We genotyped 1195 individuals and replicated the association at the 3p21.31 locus with severity, but with a stronger effect size that further increased in gravely ill patients. Transcriptome-wide association study highlighted eQTLs for LZTFL1 and CCR9. We also identified 17 loci not previously reported, suggestive for an association with either COVID-19 severity or susceptibility.

AB  - Recently, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has attracted the attention of scientists where it has a high mortality rate among older adults and individuals suffering from chronic diseases, such as chronic kidney diseases (CKD). It is important to elucidate molecular mechanisms by which COVID-19 affects the kidneys and accordingly develop proper nutritional and pharmacological strategies. Although numerous studies have recently recommended several approaches for the management of COVID-19 in CKD, its impact on patients with renal diseases remains the biggest challenge worldwide. In this paper, we review the most recent evidence regarding causality, potential nutritional supplements, therapeutic options, and management of COVID-19 infection in vulnerable individuals and patients with CKD. To date, there is no effective treatment for COVID-19-induced kidney dysfunction, and current treatments are yet limited to anti-inflammatory (e.g. ibuprofen) and anti-viral medications (e.g. Remdesivir, and Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine) that may increase the chance of treatment. In conclusion, the knowledge about kidney damage in COVID-19 is very limited, and this review improves our ability to introduce novel approaches for future clinical trials for this contiguous disease.

AB  - The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is controlled but not halted by public health measures and mass vaccination strategies which have exclusively relied on intramuscular vaccines. Intranasal vaccines can prime or recruit to the respiratory epithelium mucosal immune cells capable of preventing infection. Here we report a comprehensive series of studies on this concept using various mouse models, including HLA class II-humanized transgenic strains. We found that a single intranasal (i.n.) dose of serotype-5 adenoviral vectors expressing either the receptor binding domain (Ad5-RBD) or the complete ectodomain (Ad5-S) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was effective in inducing i) serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) anti-spike IgA and IgG, ii) robust SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing activity in the serum and BAL, iii) rigorous spike-directed T helper 1 cell/cytotoxic T cell immunity, and iv) protection of mice from a challenge with the SARS-CoV-2 beta variant. Intramuscular (i.m.) Ad5-RBD or Ad5-S administration did not induce serum or BAL IgA, and resulted in lower neutralizing titers in the serum. Moreover, prior immunity induced by an intramuscular mRNA vaccine could be potently enhanced and modulated towards a mucosal IgA response by an i.n. Ad5-S booster. Notably, Ad5 DNA was found in the liver or spleen after i.m. but not i.n. administration, indicating a lack of systemic spread of the vaccine vector, which has been associated with a risk of thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Unlike in otherwise genetically identical HLA-DQ6 mice, in HLA-DQ8 mice Ad5-RBD vaccine was inferior to Ad5-S, suggesting that the RBD fragment does not contain a sufficient collection of helper-T cell epitopes to constitute an optimal vaccine antigen. Our data add to previous promising preclinical results on intranasal SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and support the potential of this approach to elicit mucosal immunity for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Summary
Background
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Test-Trace-Isolate (TTI) programs have been recommended as a risk mitigation strategy. However, many governments have hesitated to implement them due to their costs. This study aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of implementing a national TTI program to reduce the number of severe and fatal cases of COVID-19 in Colombia.
Methods
We developed a Markov simulation model of COVID-19 infection combined with a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered structure. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive TTI strategy compared to no intervention over a one-year horizon, from both the health system and the societal perspective. Hospitalization and mortality rates were retrieved from Colombian surveillance data. We included program costs of TTI intervention, health services utilization, PCR diagnosis test, productivity loss, and government social program costs. We used the number of deaths and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as health outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were performed.
Findings
Compared with no intervention, the TTI strategy reduces COVID-19 mortality by 67%. In addition, the program saves an average of $1,045 and $850 per case when observed from the social and the health system perspective, respectively. These savings are equivalent to two times the current health expenditures in Colombia per year.
Interpretation
The TTI program is a highly cost-effective public health intervention to reduce the burden of COVID-19 in Colombia. TTI programs depend on their successful and speedy implementation.

AB  - Summary
Background
Low-dose corticosteroids have been shown to reduce mortality for patients with COVID-19 requiring oxygen or ventilatory support (non-invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). We evaluated the use of a higher dose of corticosteroids in this patient group.
Methods
This randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]) is assessing multiple possible treatments in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Eligible and consenting adult patients with clinical evidence of hypoxia (ie, receiving oxygen or with oxygen saturation <92% on room air) were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual care with higher dose corticosteroids (dexamethasone 20 mg once daily for 5 days followed by 10 mg dexamethasone once daily for 5 days or until discharge if sooner) or usual standard of care alone (which included dexamethasone 6 mg once daily for 10 days or until discharge if sooner). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality among all randomised participants. On May 11, 2022, the independent data monitoring committee recommended stopping recruitment of patients receiving no oxygen or simple oxygen only due to safety concerns. We report the results for these participants only. Recruitment of patients receiving ventilatory support is ongoing. The RECOVERY trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04381936).
Findings
Between May 25, 2021, and May 13, 2022, 1272 patients with COVID-19 and hypoxia receiving no oxygen (eight [1%]) or simple oxygen only (1264 [99%]) were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus higher dose corticosteroids (659 patients) versus usual care alone (613 patients, of whom 87% received low-dose corticosteroids during the follow-up period). Of those randomly assigned, 745 (59%) were in Asia, 512 (40%) in the UK, and 15 (1%) in Africa. 248 (19%) had diabetes and 769 (60%) were male. Overall, 123 (19%) of 659 patients allocated to higher dose corticosteroids versus 75 (12%) of 613 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 1·59 [95% CI 1·20–2·10]; p=0·0012). There was also an excess of pneumonia reported to be due to non-COVID infection (64 cases [10%] vs 37 cases [6%]; absolute difference 3·7% [95% CI 0·7–6·6]) and an increase in hyperglycaemia requiring increased insulin dose (142 [22%] vs 87 [14%]; absolute difference 7·4% [95% CI 3·2–11·5]).
Interpretation
In patients hospitalised for COVID-19 with clinical hypoxia who required either no oxygen or simple oxygen only, higher dose corticosteroids significantly increased the risk of death compared with usual care, which included low-dose corticosteroids. The RECOVERY trial continues to assess the effects of higher dose corticosteroids in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 who require non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

AB  - Summary
Background
The Omicron variant has challenged the control of the COVID-19 pandemic due to its immuno-evasive properties. The administration of a booster dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine showed positive effects in the immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2, effect that is even enhanced after the administration of a second booster.
Methods
During a phase-3 clinical trial, we evaluated the effect of a second booster of CoronaVac®, an inactivated vaccine administered 6 months after the first booster, in the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 87). In parallel, cellular immunity (n = 45) was analyzed in stimulated peripheral mononuclear cells by flow cytometry and ELISPOT.
Findings
Although a 2.5-fold increase in neutralization of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 was observed after the second booster when compared with prior its administration (Geometric mean units p < 0.0001; Geometric mean titer p = 0.0002), a poor neutralization against the Omicron variant was detected. Additionally, the activation of specific CD4+ T lymphocytes remained stable after the second booster and, importantly, equivalent activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes against the Omicron variant and the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 were found.
Interpretation
Although the neutralizing response against the Omicron variant after the second booster of CoronaVac® was slightly increased, these levels are far from those observed against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and could most likely fail to neutralize the virus. In contrast, a robust CD4+T cell response may confer protection against the Omicron variant.

AB  - There is concern that people with rheumatic disease, often treated with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medication, may be at an increased risk of poor outcomes of novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). However, hyperinflammation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 and treatment with glucocorticoids has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19. Therefore, uncertainty exists about continuing or withholding immune therapies with the risk of infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This review covers the current knowledge with respect to the risk of infection and outcomes and risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with rheumatic disease. We also discuss data from other immune-mediated diseases and its relevance to patients with rheumatic disease. In addition, we cover the limitations of the research efforts to date and how the current knowledge translates into practice guidance. Finally, we discuss our vision of the future research agenda.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Clinical manifestations of the disease range from an asymptomatic condition to life-threatening events and death, with more severe courses being associated with age, male sex, and comorbidities. Besides these risk factors, intrinsic characteristics of the virus as well as genetic factors of the host are expected to account for COVID-19 clinical heterogeneity. Genetic studies have long been recognized as fundamental to identify biological mechanisms underlying congenital diseases, to pinpoint genes/proteins responsible for the susceptibility to different inherited conditions, to highlight targets of therapeutic relevance, to suggest drug repurposing, and even to clarify causal relationships that make modifiable some environmental risk factors. Though these studies usually take long time to be concluded and, above all, to translate their discoveries to patients' bedside, the scientific community moved really fast to deliver genetic signals underlying different COVID-19 phenotypes. In this Review, besides a concise description of COVID-19 symptomatology and of SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of infection, we aimed to recapitulate the current literature in terms of host genetic factors that specifically associate with an increased severity of the disease.

AB  - Summary
Up to 50% of the people who have died from COVID-19 had metabolic and vascular disorders. Notably, there are many direct links between COVID-19 and the metabolic and endocrine systems. Thus, not only are patients with metabolic dysfunction (eg, obesity, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and diabetes) at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 but also infection with SARS-CoV-2 might lead to new-onset diabetes or aggravation of pre-existing metabolic disorders. In this Review, we provide an update on the mechanisms of how metabolic and endocrine disorders might predispose patients to develop severe COVID-19. Additionally, we update the practical recommendations and management of patients with COVID-19 and post-pandemic. Furthermore, we summarise new treatment options for patients with both COVID-19 and diabetes, and highlight current challenges in clinical management.

AB  - Background
This study sought to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of plasmapheresis, Tocilizumab, and Tocilizumab with plasmapheresis treatment on the removal of inflammatory cytokines and improvement clinically of patients with severe COVID-19 in Intensive Care Units (ICU) due to the association between increased cytokine release and the severity of COVID-19.
Methods
This clinical trial study was conducted in three treatment arms in Iran. All patients received standard care and randomization into one of three treatment groups; Tocilizumab (TCZ) alone, plasmapheresis alone, or a combination of Tocilizumab and plasmapheresis. Demographics, clinical evaluation, oxygenation status, laboratory tests and imaging data were evaluated in the three groups and re-checked 48 h after the end of treatment trials. Primary outcomes were oxygenation status, the need for mechanical ventilation and the rate of death.
Results
Ninety-four patients were included in the trial after meeting the eligibility requirements. Twenty-eight patients received Tocilizumab alone, 33 had plasmapheresis alone, and 33 received both Tocilizumab and plasmapheresis. Baseline characteristics did not differ between three groups that included demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters. Following therapy, there was no difference between the three groups for CRP, ferritin, d-dimer, IL-6, pro-calcitonin and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (P > 0.05). While a significant reduction was found in CRP levels within each group (32.04 ± 42.43 to 17.40 ± 38.11, 51.28 ± 40.96 to 26.36 ± 33.07 and 41.20 ± 34.27 to 21.56 ± 24.96 in the tocilizumab, plasmapheresis, and combined group, respectively) (p < 0.05), procalcitonin levels were elevated significantly in the Tocilizumab group (0.28 ± 0.09 to 0.37 ± 0.11) (p < 0.05). Clinically there was no difference between the three groups following treatment for O2 saturation levels with supplementary oxygen at discharge, endotracheal intubation rate, use of NIVPP, mortality, mean hospital and ICU length of stay (p > 0.05).
Conclusion
Study results showed that the reduction of serum inflammatory markers, the rate of intubation and therapeutic complications including death were no different between the three groups; however, CRP levels were significantly reduced in all three groups, indicating that the interventions reduced inflammation likely through a reduction in the cytokine storm, though clinical outcomes were unaffected.

AB  - Inflammation is an established driver of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and a mechanism linked to the increased susceptibility to fatal COVID-19 demonstrated by patients with cancer. As patients with cancer exhibit a higher level of inflammation compared with the general patient population, patients with cancer and COVID-19 may uniquely benefit from strategies targeted at overcoming the unrestrained pro-inflammatory response. Targeted and non-targeted anti-inflammatory therapies may prevent end-organ damage in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer and decrease mortality. Here, we review the clinical role of selective inhibition of pro-inflammatory interleukins, tyrosine kinase modulation, anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, and other non-targeted approaches including corticosteroids in their roles as disease-modulating agents in patients with COVID-19 and cancer. Investigation of these therapeutics in this highly vulnerable patient group is posited to facilitate the development of tailored therapeutics for this patient population, aiding the transition of systemic inflammation from a prognostic domain to a source of therapeutic targets.

AB  - Summary
Background & aims
Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and Mendelian randomization studies suggest that cardiometabolic diseases may be associated with COVID-19 risk and prognosis, with evidence implicating insulin resistance (IR) as a common biological mechanism. As driving factors for IR, we examined body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) among postmenopausal women in association with COVID-19 outcomes (positivity and hospitalization), and the role of glucose homeostasis as a mediator of this relationship.
Methods
Associations of BMI and WC at baseline (1993–1998) with COVID-19 outcomes collected at Survey 1 (June–December, 2020) and/or Survey 2 (September–December, 2021) were evaluated among 42,770 Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) participants (baseline age: 59.36 years) of whom 16,526 self-reported having taken ≥1 COVID-19 test, with 1242 reporting ≥1 positive COVID-19 test and 362 reporting ≥1 COVID-19 hospitalization. We applied logistic regression and causal mediation analyses to sub-samples with available fasting biomarkers of glucose homeostasis (glucose, insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, Homeostasis Model Assessment for β-cell function, Quantitative Insulin-sensitivity Check Index, Triglyceride-Glucose index (TyG)) at baseline, whereby 57 of 759 reported COVID-19 test positivity and 23 of 1896 reported COVID-19 hospitalization.
Results
In fully adjusted models, higher BMI, WC and TyG were associated with COVID-19 test positivity and hospitalization. Glucose concentrations mediated associations of BMI and WC with COVID-19 positivity, whereas TyG mediated BMI and WC’s associations with COVID-19 hospitalization.
Conclusions
Obesity and central obesity markers collected an average of 24 years prior were associated with COVID-19 outcomes among postmenopausal women. Glucose concentration and TyG partly mediated these associations.

AB  - Background
Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are highly susceptible from respiratory exacerbations from viral respiratory tract infections. However, it is unclear whether they are at increased risk of COVID-19 pneumonia or COVID-19-related mortality. We aimed to determine whether COPD is a risk factor for adverse COVID-19 outcomes including hospitalization, severe COVID-19, or death.
Methods
Following the PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic review of COVID-19 clinical studies published between November 1st, 2019 and January 28th, 2021 (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020191491). We included studies that quantified the number of COPD patients, and reported at least one of the following outcomes stratified by COPD status: hospitalization; severe COVID-19; ICU admission; mechanical ventilation; acute respiratory distress syndrome; or mortality. We meta-analyzed the results of individual studies to determine the odds ratio (OR) of these outcomes in patients with COPD compared to those without COPD.
Findings
Fifty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria, and underwent data extraction. Most studies were retrospective cohort studies/case series of hospitalized patients. Only four studies examined the effects of COPD on COVID-19 outcomes as their primary endpoint. In aggregate, COPD was associated with increased odds of hospitalization (OR 4.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.65–4.90), ICU admission (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.02–1.78), and mortality (OR 2.47, 95% CI 2.18–2.79).
Interpretation
Having a clinical diagnosis of COPD significantly increases the odds of poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. COPD patients should thus be considered a high-risk group, and targeted for preventative measures and aggressive treatment for COVID-19 including vaccination.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide, and while the mortality rate remains the primary concern, it is becoming increasingly apparent that many COVID-19 survivors experience long-term sequelae, representing a major concern for both themselves and healthcare providers. Comparing long-term sequelae following COVID-19 to those of other respiratory viruses such as influenza, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1 is an essential step toward understanding the extent and impact of these sequelae. A literature search was carried out using the PubMed. database. Search-terms included “persistent”, “long-term”, “chronic”, and MeSH-terms for SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and Influenza. Only English-language articles were selected. Articles were screened by title/abstract and full-text readings. Key points for comparison were persistent symptoms > 4 weeks, virus type, study design, population size, admission status, methods, and findings. Thirty-one articles were included: 19 on SARS-CoV-1, 10 on influenza, and 2 on MERS-CoV-survivors. Damage to the respiratory system was the main long-term manifestation after the acute phase of infection. Quality of life-related and psychological sequelae were the second and third most widely reported symptoms, respectively. Consistent with long-term sequelae from COVID-19, persisting cardiovascular, neurological, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal impairments were also reported. In summary, the long-term sequelae following COVID-19 are a significant concern, and while long-term sequelae following influenza, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1 have also been reported, their prevalence and severity are less clear. It is essential to continue to study and monitor the long-term effects of all respiratory viruses so as to improve our understanding and develop strategies for prevention and treatment.

AB  - Summary
This study investigated whether variability in air quality, especially related to vehicular emissions, during the COVID-19 pandemic could indicate social distancing. Data from in situ measurements and satellite estimates were used. The study areas were São Paulo, Brazil, and Bologna, Italy. We focused our analysis on NO2, a combustion-derived pollutant, because of its availability in surface stations and satellite tracking, and because it has a short atmospheric lifetime. The analyses included graphical, statistical, and wavelet transform-based approaches to understand NO2 concentrations before and during the pandemic. After confirming the reduction in vehicular emissions during the pandemic, we created normalized indices to assess the social remoteness in 2020 in different locations, with a focus on São Paulo and Bologna. These indices were compared to existing indices based on cell phone mobility. The indices proposed in this study suffered high sensitivity to social distance compared to existing ones and helped to understand the actual application of social distance and contamination rates, considering the various dimensions of the problem.

AB  - Summary
Background
Several small studies on patients with COVID-19 and haematological malignancies are available showing a high mortality in this population. The Italian Hematology Alliance on COVID-19 aimed to collect data from adult patients with haematological malignancies who required hospitalisation for COVID-19.
Methods
This multicentre, retrospective, cohort study included adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with diagnosis of a WHO-defined haematological malignancy admitted to 66 Italian hospitals between Feb 25 and May 18, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed and symptomatic COVID-19. Data cutoff for this analysis was June 22, 2020. The primary outcome was mortality and evaluation of potential predictive parameters of mortality. We calculated standardised mortality ratios between observed death in the study cohort and expected death by applying stratum-specific mortality rates of the Italian population with COVID-19 and an Italian cohort of 31 993 patients with haematological malignancies without COVID-19 (data up to March 1, 2019). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify factors associated with overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04352556, and the prospective part of the study is ongoing.
Findings
We enrolled 536 patients with a median follow-up of 20 days (IQR 10–34) at data cutoff, 85 (16%) of whom were managed as outpatients. 440 (98%) of 451 hospitalised patients completed their hospital course (were either discharged alive or died). 198 (37%) of 536 patients died. When compared with the general Italian population with COVID-19, the standardised mortality ratio was 2·04 (95% CI 1·77–2·34) in our whole study cohort and 3·72 (2·86–4·64) in individuals younger than 70 years. When compared with the non-COVID-19 cohort with haematological malignancies, the standardised mortality ratio was 41·3 (38·1–44·9). Older age (hazard ratio 1·03, 95% CI 1·01–1·05); progressive disease status (2·10, 1·41–3·12); diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (3·49, 1·56–7·81), indolent non-Hodgin lymphoma (2·19, 1·07–4·48), aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (2·56, 1·34–4·89), or plasma cell neoplasms (2·48, 1·31–4·69), and severe or critical COVID-19 (4·08, 2·73–6·09) were associated with worse overall survival.
Interpretation
This study adds to the evidence that patients with haematological malignancies have worse outcomes than both the general population with COVID-19 and patients with haematological malignancies without COVID-19. The high mortality among patients with haematological malignancies hospitalised with COVID-19 highlights the need for aggressive infection prevention strategies, at least until effective vaccination or treatment strategies are available.

AB  - Shelter-in-place mandates and closure of nonessential businesses have been central to COVID19 response strategies including in Toronto, Canada. Approximately half of the working population in Canada are employed in occupations that do not allow for remote work suggesting potentially limited impact of some of the strategies proposed to mitigate COVID-19 acquisition and onward transmission risks and associated morbidity and mortality. We compared per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 23, 2020 to January 24, 2021, across neighborhoods in Toronto by proportion of the population working in essential services. We used person-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 community cases and deaths, and census data for neighborhood-level attributes. Cumulative per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths were 3.3-fold and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, in neighborhoods with the highest versus lowest concentration of essential workers. Findings suggest that the population who continued to serve the essential needs of society throughout COVID-19 shouldered a disproportionate burden of transmission and deaths. Taken together, results signal the need for active intervention strategies to complement restrictive measures to optimize both the equity and effectiveness of COVID-19 responses.

AB  - Background
Available national public data are often too incomplete and noisy to be used directly to interpret the evolution of epidemics over time, which is essential for making timely and appropriate decisions. The use of compartment models can be a worthwhile and attractive approach to address this problem. The present study proposes a model compartmentalized by sex and age groups that allows for more complete information on the evolution of the CoViD-19 pandemic in Italy.
Material and methods
Italian public data on CoViD-19 were pre-treated with a 7-day moving average filter to reduce noise. A time-varying susceptible-infected-recovered-deceased (SIRD) model distributed by age and sex groups was then proposed. Recovered and infected individuals distributed by groups were reconstructed through the SIRD model, which was also used to simulate and identify optimal scenarios of pandemic containment by vaccination. The simulation started from realistic initial conditions based on the SIRD model parameters, estimated from filtered and reconstructed Italian data, at different pandemic times and phases. The following three objective functions, accounting for total infections, total deaths, and total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, were minimized by optimizing the percentages of vaccinated individuals in five different age groups.
Results
The developed SIRD model clearly highlighted those pandemic phases in which younger people, who had more contacts and lower mortality, infected older people, characterized by a significantly higher mortality, especially in males. Optimizing vaccination strategies yielded different results depending on the cost function used. As expected, to reduce total deaths, the suggested strategy was to vaccinate the older age groups, whatever the baseline scenario. In contrast, for QALYs lost and total infections, the optimal vaccine solutions strongly depended on the initial pandemic conditions: during phases of high virus diffusion, the model suggested to vaccinate mainly younger groups with a higher contact rate.
Conclusion
Because of the poor quality and insufficient availability of stratified public pandemic data, ad hoc information filtering and reconstruction procedures proved essential. The time-varying SIRD model, stratified by age and sex groups, provided insights and additional information on the dynamics of CoViD-19 infection in Italy, also supporting decision making for containment strategies such as vaccination.

AB  - A key issue for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is whether non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions (NPIs) retard death rates. Good information about causal effects from NPIs comes from flu-related excess deaths in large U.S. cities during the second wave of the Great Influenza Pandemic, September 1918-February 1919. The measured NPIs are in three categories: school closings, prohibitions of public gatherings, and quarantine/isolation. Although an increase in NPIs flattened the curve in the sense of reducing the ratio of peak to overall flu-related excess death rates, the estimated effect on overall deaths is small and statistically insignificant. These findings differ from those associated with COVID-19 in the sense that facemask mandates and usage seem to reduce COVID-related cases.

AB  - Objectives
To assess the economic burden of COVID-19 that would arise absent behavioral or policy responses under the herd immunity approach in the United States and compare it to the total burden that also accounts for estimates of the value of lives lost.
Methods
We use the trajectories of age-specific human and physical capital in the production process to calculate output changes based on a human capital–augmented production function. We also calculate the total burden that results when including the value of lives lost as calculated from mortality rates of COVID-19 and estimates for the value of a statistical life in the United States based on studies assessing individual’s willingness to pay to avoid risks.
Results
Our results indicate that the GDP loss associated with unmitigated COVID-19 would amount to a cumulative US$1.4 trillion by 2030 assuming that 60 percent of the population is infected over three years. This is equivalent to around 7.7 percent of GDP in 2019 (in constant 2010 US$) or an average tax on yearly output of 0.6 percent. After applying the value of a statistical life to account for the value of lives lost, our analyses show that the total burden can mount to between US$17 and 94 trillion over the next decade, which is equivalent to an annual tax burden between 8 and 43 percent.
Conclusion
Our results show that the United States would incur a sizeable burden if it adopted a non-interventionist herd immunity approach.

AB  - Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented changes in care delivery across the pregnancy care continuum. Our primary objective with this research was to characterize the range of ways that the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic affected pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care experiences.
Methods
Pregnant and recently pregnant patients (n = 20) from obstetrics and gynecology clinical sites associated with Massachusetts General Hospital were interviewed about their experiences with prenatal care, childbirth, and postpartum care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interview transcripts were analyzed for emergent themes.
Results
This sample included 20 pregnant and postpartum people, including 11 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy or postpartum and nine with suspected infection. The ways in which COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19 affected experiences of prenatal care, childbirth, and postpartum care were complex and varied. Three themes were identified across narratives of pregnancy, birth, and postpartum care: patient perceptions of diminished access to care, stigma due to COVID-19 infection, and limited capacity of providers to honor patient preferences.
Conclusions
A better understanding of pregnant and recently pregnant people's experiences during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic can inform infection control policies and clinical care delivery practices that are more congruent with the needs and values of pregnant, birthing, and postpartum people as institutions craft responses to future pandemics. Approaches that maximize meaningful access across the pregnancy care continuum, center patients' priorities within adapted care models, and honor patient preferences as much as possible are important aspects of an appropriate response to future waves of COVID-19 and other pandemics.

We will take into consideration the ways in which people from four different age ranges react to the virus. Using an appropriate transmission function, we estimate the impact of the third surge of COVID-19 in Italy. Also, we assess two different vaccination programmes. In one of them, a single shot is administered to all citizens over 16 years old before second shots are available. In the second model, first and second shots are administered to each citizen within, approximately, 20 days of time-gap.

AB  - During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, obesity has been shown to be an independent risk factor for high morbidity and mortality. Obesity confers poor outcomes in younger (<60 years) patients, an age-group considered low-risk for complications, a privilege that is negated by obesity. Findings are consistent, the higher the body mass index (BMI) the worse the outcomes. Ectopic (visceral) obesity also promotes proinflammatory, prothrombotic, and vasoconstrictive states, thus enhancing the deleterious effects of COVID-19 disease. Less, albeit robust, evidence also exists for a higher risk of COVID-19 infection incurred with underweight. Thus, the relationship of COVID-19 and BMI has a J-curve pattern, where patients with both overweight/obesity and underweight are more susceptible to the ailments of COVID-19. The pathophysiology underlying this link is multifactorial, mostly relating to the inflammatory state characterizing obesity, the impaired immune response to infectious agents coupled with increased viral load, the overexpression in adipose tissue of the receptors and proteases for viral entry, an increased sympathetic activity, limited cardiorespiratory reserve, a prothrombotic milieu, and the associated comorbidities. All these issues are herein reviewed, the results of large studies and meta-analyses are tabulated and the pathogenetic mechanisms and the BMI relationship with COVID-19 are pictorially illustrated.

AB  - We simulate the impact of school reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic in three major urban centers in Brazil to identify the epidemiological indicators and the best timing for the return of in-school activities and the effect of contact tracing as a mitigation measure. Our goal is to offer guidelines for evidence-based policymaking. We implement an extended SEIR model stratified by age and considering contact networks in different settings – school, home, work, and community, in which the infection transmission rate is affected by various intervention measures. After fitting epidemiological and demographic data, we simulate scenarios with increasing school transmission due to school reopening, and also estimate the number of hospitalization and deaths averted by the implementation of contact tracing. Reopening schools results in a non-linear increase in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, which is highly dependent on infection and disease incidence at the time of reopening. When contact tracing and quarantining are restricted to school and home settings, a large number of daily tests is required to produce significant effects in reducing the total number of hospitalizations and deaths. Policymakers should carefully consider the epidemiological context and timing regarding the implementation of school closure and return of in-person school activities. While contact tracing strategies prevent new infections within school environments, they alone are not sufficient to avoid significant impacts on community transmission.

AB  - Background
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a pivotal role in the immunologic response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Exaggerated inflammatory response of innate immune cells, however, may drive morbidity and death in Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
Objective
We investigated the engagement of SARS-CoV-2 with TLR4 in order to better understand how to tackle hyperinflammation in COVID-19.
Methods
We combined RNA-sequencing data of human lung tissue and of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells derived from COVID-19 patients with functional studies in human macrophages using SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and viable SARS-CoV-2. Pharmacological inhibitors as well as gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 were used to delineate the signalling pathways involved.
Results
We found TLR4 to be the most abundantly upregulated TLR in human lung tissue irrespective of the underlying pathology. Accordingly, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from patients with severe COVID-19 showed an NF-κB-pathway dominated immune response, whereas they were mostly defined by type I interferon signalling in moderate COVID-19. Mechanistically, we found the Spike ectodomain, but not receptor binding domain monomer to induce TLR4-dependent inflammation in human macrophages. By using pharmacological inhibitors as well as CRISPR/Cas9 deleted macrophages, we identify SARS-CoV-2 to engage canonical TLR4-MyD88 signalling. Importantly, we demonstrate that TLR4 blockage prevents exaggerated inflammatory responses in human macrophages infected with different SARS-CoV-2 variants, including immune escape variants B.1.1.7.-E484K and B.1.1.529 (omicron).
Conclusion
Our study critically extends the current knowledge on TLR-mediated hyperinflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 in human macrophages, paving the way for novel approaches to tackle severe COVID-19.
Take-home message
Our study combining human lung transcriptomics with functional studies in human macrophages clearly supports the design and development of TLR4 - directed therapeutics to mitigate hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
Background
Differences in the distribution of individual-level clinical risk factors across regions do not fully explain the observed global disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. We aimed to investigate the associations between environmental and societal factors and country-level variations in mortality attributed to COVID-19 among people with rheumatic disease globally.
Methods
In this observational study, we derived individual-level data on adults (aged 18–99 years) with rheumatic disease and a confirmed status of their highest COVID-19 severity level from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance (GRA) registry, collected between March 12, 2020, and Aug 27, 2021. Environmental and societal factors were obtained from publicly available sources. The primary endpoint was mortality attributed to COVID-19. We used a multivariable logistic regression to evaluate independent associations between environmental and societal factors and death, after controlling for individual-level risk factors. We used a series of nested mixed-effects models to establish whether environmental and societal factors sufficiently explained country-level variations in death.
Findings
14 044 patients from 23 countries were included in the analyses. 10 178 (72·5%) individuals were female and 3866 (27·5%) were male, with a mean age of 54·4 years (SD 15·6). Air pollution (odds ratio 1·10 per 10 μg/m3 [95% CI 1·01–1·17]; p=0·0105), proportion of the population aged 65 years or older (1·19 per 1% increase [1·10–1·30]; p<0·0001), and population mobility (1·03 per 1% increase in number of visits to grocery and pharmacy stores [1·02–1·05]; p<0·0001 and 1·02 per 1% increase in number of visits to workplaces [1·00–1·03]; p=0·032) were independently associated with higher odds of mortality. Number of hospital beds (0·94 per 1-unit increase per 1000 people [0·88–1·00]; p=0·046), human development index (0·65 per 0·1-unit increase [0·44–0·96]; p=0·032), government response stringency (0·83 per 10-unit increase in containment index [0·74–0·93]; p=0·0018), as well as follow-up time (0·78 per month [0·69–0·88]; p<0·0001) were independently associated with lower odds of mortality. These factors sufficiently explained country-level variations in death attributable to COVID-19 (intraclass correlation coefficient 1·2% [0·1–9·5]; p=0·14).
Interpretation
Our findings highlight the importance of environmental and societal factors as potential explanations of the observed regional disparities in COVID-19 outcomes among people with rheumatic disease and lay foundation for a new research agenda to address these disparities.

AB  - Antivirals already on the market and expertise gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks are gaining momentum as the most effective way to combat the coronavirus outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 has caused considerable mortality due to respiratory failure, highlighting the immediate need for successful therapies as well as the long-term need for antivirals to combat potential emergent mutants of coronaviruses. There are constant viral mutations are being observed due to which world is experiencing different waves of SARS-CoV-2. If our understanding of the virology and clinical presentation of COVID-19 grows, so does the pool of possible pharmacological targets. In COVID-19, the difficulties of proper analysis of current pre-clinical/clinical data as well as the creation of new evidence concerning drug repurposing will be crucial. The current manuscript aims to evaluate the repurposing of an anti-HIV drug Darunavir Ethanolate in COVID-19 treatment with in silico study and we discuss the therapeutic progress of Darunavir Etanolate, to prevent SARS-CoV-2 replication, which supports its clinical assessment for COVID-19 therapy.

AB  - The paper contributes to the body of knowledge working towards enhancing the understanding of crisis and disaster preparedness and effective response, via the lens of the ongoing global pandemic and responding to the questions: do the current measures for pandemic preparedness reflect preparedness adequately, and what does pandemic preparedness mean? We analysed how the reported cumulative mortality rates, during the spring of 2020 and in the 60 days after the date of a country's first COVID-19 related death, compared to the expected preparedness rank according to the existing global preparedness indices (IHR and GHSI) on a country level. We found, at country level, that the health-related outcomes from the first wave of the pandemic were primarily negatively correlated with the expected preparedness. We contend that our results indicate a need to investigate further development and enhancement of the preparedness indices.

AB  - Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is one of the most widely used vaccines in the world. It protects against many non-mycobacterial infections secondary to its nonspecific immune effects. The mechanism for these effects includes modification of innate and adaptive immunity. The alteration in innate immunity is through histone modifications and epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes to develop an inflammatory phenotype, a process called “trained immunity.” The memory T cells of adaptive immunity are also responsible for resistance against secondary infections after administration of BCG vaccine, a process called “heterologous immunity.” Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine is known to not only boosts immune responses to many vaccines when they are co-administered but also decrease severity of these infections when used alone. The BCG vaccine by itself induces a TH1 type response, and its use as a vector has also shown promising results. This review article summarizes the studies showing effects of BCG vaccines on various viral infections, its role in enhancing vaccine responses, the mechanisms for this protective effect, and information on its effect on COVID-19.

AB  - From the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic it became evident that children infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain mostly asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. We reviewed the epidemiologic and clinical features of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The true prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is most likely underestimated, as asymptomatic children are less frequently tested. Serologic surveys indicate that half of children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 report no symptoms. Anosmia/ageusia is not frequent in children but it is the strongest predictor of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. In general, children with COVID-19 are at lower risk of hospitalization and life-threatening complications. Nevertheless, cases of severe disease or a post-infectious multisystem hyperinflammatory syndrome named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) have been described. Rarely children with severe COVID-19 develop neurologic complications. In addition, studies indicate that school closures have a limited impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, much less than other social distancing measures. The past months new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged with higher transmissibility and an increased impact on morbidity and deaths. The role of children in the transmission dynamics of these variants must be elucidated. Lastly, preliminary results from COVID-19 vaccine trials indicate very good efficacy and tolerability in children. Very recently the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities recommend vaccination of children 12 years or older to protect them but mostly to contribute to the achievement of herd immunity.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic affects mortality and morbidity, with disruptions expected to continue for some time, with access to timely cancer-related services a concern. For breast cancer, early detection and treatment is key to improved survival and longer-term quality of life. Health services generally have been strained and in many settings with population breast mammography screening, efforts to diagnose and treat breast cancers earlier have been paused or have had reduced capacity. The resulting delays to diagnosis and treatment may lead to more intensive treatment requirements and, potentially, increased mortality. Modelled evaluations can support responses to the pandemic by estimating short- and long-term outcomes for various scenarios. Multiple calibrated and validated models exist for breast cancer screening, and some have been applied in 2020 to estimate the impact of breast screening disruptions and compare options for recovery, in a range of international settings. On behalf of the Covid and Cancer Modelling Consortium (CCGMC) Working Group 2 (Breast Cancer), we summarize and provide examples of such in a range of settings internationally, and propose priorities for future modelling exercises. International expert collaborations from the CCGMC Working Group 2 (Breast Cancer) will conduct analyses and modelling studies needed to inform key stakeholders recovery efforts in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on mental health symptoms and quality of life (QoL) in the general population due to necessary public health restrictions such as social distancing. The psychosocial effect of the pandemic on vulnerable groups such as people living with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) has been scarcely explored in countries with additional socioeconomical burdens such as access to healthcare disparities
Methods
A questionnaire exploring sociodemographic variables, quality of life, mental health determinants and sleep quality was applied to 92 PwMS to explore changes prior and during the pandemic regarding these domains
Results
58.8% of the subjects were female, median age was 37.1 (± 8.5) years and relapsing-remitting MS was the predominant clinical subtype (83.5%). Unemployment rate significantly increased during the pandemic (12.3% vs 27.8%; p= 0.001). Only 46.4% received medical follow-up care during the pandemic. QoL was affected predominantly due to limitations in instrumented activities of daily life (IADL). Neuropsychiatric symptoms, requiring healthcare during the pandemic, anxiety prior to the pandemic and restricted IADL were predictors of MS-related physical impact worsening, while decreased physical/emotional wellbeing selfcare, neuropsychiatric symptoms, bad sleep quality, anxiety prior to the pandemic and restricted non-instrumental ADL predicted aggravation of MS-related psychological impact measured by the MSIS-29. Curiously, specific items regarding anxiety were more prevalent prior to the pandemic (anxious mood; p=0.02, helplessness; p=0.01), sleep problems; p=0.001 and cardiovascular symptoms; p=0.001, nevertheless, stability was observed for most items. Importantly, 77.3% of PwMS reported at least one neuropsychiatric symptom
Conclusion
The deleterious effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychosocial wellbeing in PwMS, QoL and mental health outcomes are frequently overseen in vulnerable populations such as PwMS. Albeit the limitations of this study, our results may help implement policies that prevent negative outcomes on psychosocial wellbeing due to public health measures (e.g., social distancing) in MS and other neurological diseases that inexorably need constant follow-up.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly emerged as one of the biggest public health concerns of the 21st century. Although it was initially reported as a cluster of pneumonia cases, it quickly became apparent that COVID-19 is not merely a respiratory tract infection. Its clinical course is often complicated by cardiovascular manifestations including venous and arterial thrombosis, electrical disturbances, and myocardial damage. In addition, the cardiovascular system is involved not only during infection but also preceding the contraction of the virus; having cardiovascular comorbidities indicates significant vulnerability to the pathogen. As longer-term data continue to accumulate, we now have concerns over its lasting cardiovascular effects after recovery. Moreover, there have been substantial collateral effects on the epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases. Reports of adverse cardiovascular events from vaccination have emerged as new hurdles to our efforts to bring an end to the pandemic. As such, the association between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system and cardiovascular practice in general is expansive. In this review, we provide an overview of the knowledge and considerations in this field, based on the evidence available at the time of this writing.

AB  - In today's information age, both excess and lack of information can cause a disaster. COVID-19 pandemic not only highlighted the significance of risk communication but also pointed out several unintended and distressing consequences due to information gaps and miscommunications. Despite facing a common threat, the local communities suffered differential impacts during the pandemic. This paper classifies the nature of risk communications experienced across different countries into three categories, namely: inadequate, ideal, and infodemic risk communication that influenced the local perceptions and responses. It further argues that inadequately planned risk communications tend to create new risks and compromise the efforts towards managing a disaster. As global risks are responded locally, there is a need for more inclusive and engaging risk communication that involves communities as responsible stakeholders who understand, plan, and respond to risks to increase their propensity for resilience during disasters and crisis situations.

AB  - The article describes the possible pathophysiological origin of COVID-19 and the crucial role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), providing several “converging” evidence in support of this hypothesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to initially upregulate ACE2 systemic activity (early phase), which can subsequently induce compensatory responses leading to upregulation of both arms of the RAS (late phase) and consequently to critical, advanced and untreatable stages of COVID-19 disease. The main and initial actors of the process are ACE2 and ADAM17 zinc-metalloproteases, which, initially triggered by SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, work together in increasing circulating Ang 1–7 and Ang 1–9 peptides and downstream (Mas and Angiotensin type 2 receptors) pathways with anti-inflammatory, hypotensive and antithrombotic activities. During the late phase of severe COVID-19, compensatory secretion of renin and ACE enzymes are subsequently upregulated, leading to inflammation, hypertension and thrombosis, which further sustain ACE2 and ADAM17 upregulation. Based on this hypothesis, COVID-19-phase-specific inhibition of different RAS enzymes is proposed as a pharmacological strategy against COVID-19 and vaccine-induced adverse effects. The aim is to prevent the establishment of positive feedback-loops, which can sustain hyperactivity of both arms of the RAS independently of viral trigger and, in some cases, may lead to Long-COVID syndrome.

AB  - Objectives
The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic declared by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 impacted healthcare services with provider and patient cancellations, delays, and patient avoidance or delay of emergency department or urgent care. Limited data exist on the population proportion affected by delayed healthcare, which is important for future healthcare planning efforts. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare service cancellations or delays and delays/avoidance of emergency/urgent care overall and by population characteristics.
Study design
This was a cross-sectional study.
Methods
Our sample (n = 2314) was assembled through a phone survey from 8/12/2020–10/27/2020 among non-institutionalized St. Louis County, Missouri, USA residents ≥18 years. We asked about provider and patient-initiated cancellations or delays of appointments and pandemic-associated delays/avoidance of emergency/urgent care overall and by participant characteristics. We calculated weighted prevalence estimates by select resident characteristics.
Results
Healthcare services cancellations or delays affected ∼54% (95% CI 50.6%–57.1%) of residents with dental (31.1%, 95% CI 28.1%–34.0%) and primary care (22.1%, 95% CI 19.5%–24.6%) being most common. The highest prevalences were among those who were White, ≥65 years old, female, in fair/poor health, who had health insurance, and who had ≥1 medical condition. Delayed or avoided emergency/urgent care impacted ∼23% (95% CI 19.9%–25.4%) of residents with a higher prevalence in females than males.
Conclusions
Healthcare use disruptions impacted a substantial proportion of residents. Future healthcare planning efforts should consider these data to minimize potential morbidity and mortality from delayed care.

AB  - The two genetically similar severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, have each been responsible for global epidemics of vastly different scales. Although both viruses arose from similar origins, they quickly diverged due to differences in their transmission dynamics and spectrum of clinical presentations. The potential involvement of multiple organs systems, including the respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal and neurological, during infection necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the clinical pathogenesis of each virus. The management of COVID-19, initially modelled after SARS and other respiratory illnesses, has continued to evolve as we accumulate more knowledge and experience during the pandemic, as well as develop new therapeutics and vaccines. The impact of these two coronaviruses has been profound for our health care and public health systems, and we hope that the lessons learned will not only bring the current pandemic under control, but also prevent and reduce the impact of future pandemics.

AB  - Due to the unprecedented public health crisis caused by COVID-19, our first contribution to the newly launching journal, Advances in Biomarker Sciences and Technology, has abruptly diverted to focus on the current pandemic. As the number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise steadily around the world, the common goal of healthcare providers, scientists, and government officials worldwide has been to identify the best way to detect the novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, and to treat the viral infection – COVID-19. Accurate detection, timely diagnosis, effective treatment, and future prevention are the vital keys to management of COVID-19, and can help curb the viral spread. Traditionally, biomarkers play a pivotal role in the early detection of disease etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. To assist myriad ongoing investigations and innovations, we developed this current article to overview known and emerging biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 detection, COVID-19 diagnostics, treatment and prognosis, and ongoing work to identify and develop more biomarkers for new drugs and vaccines. Moreover, biomarkers of socio-psychological stress, the high-technology quest for new virtual drug screening, and digital applications are described.

AB  - Potential regional variations in effects of COVID-19 on federally mandated, program-specific evaluations by the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) have been controversial. SRTR January 2022 program evaluations ended transplant follow-up on March 12, 2020, and excluded transplants performed from March 13, 2020 to June 12, 2020 (the “carve-out”). This study examined the carve-out’s impact, and the effect of additionally censoring COVID-19 deaths, on first-year posttransplant outcomes for transplants from July 2018 through December 2020. Program-specific hazard ratios (HRs) for graft failure and death estimated under two alternative scenarios were compared with published HRs: (1) the carve-out was removed; (2) the carve-out was retained, but deaths due to COVID-19 were additionally censored. The HRs estimated by censoring COVID-19 deaths were highly correlated with those estimated with the carve-out alone (r2 = .96). Removal of the carve-out resulted in greater variation in HRs while remaining highly correlated (r2 = .82); however, little geographic impact of the carve-out was observed. The carve-out increased average HR in the Northwest by 0.049; carve-out plus censoring reduced average HR in the Midwest by 0.009. Other regions of the country were not significantly affected. Thus, the current COVID-19 carve-out does not appear to impart substantial bias based on the region of the country.

AB  - Purpose
There are concerns that the social, economic and health impacts of COVID-19 are unevenly distributed, exacerbating existing inequalities. Here we tested the hypotheses that: (H1) the magnitude of these impacts would be associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety early in the pandemic, and (H2) that these impacts would be associated with a range of sociodemographic risk factors.
Methods
Cross-sectional self-report data were collected from a UK sample (N = 632) between the 16th of May and 21st of July 2020, coinciding with the early stages of the pandemic and first UK lockdown. Data were collected on COVID-19 related impacts including financial and social stressors, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and sociodemographic/economic risk factors operationalised at multiple levels including the individual, familial, household and neighbourhood.
Results
Using regression analyses both financial and social impacts were independently associated with anxiety (R2 = 0.23) and depression scores (R2 = 0.24), as well as clinically significant generalised anxiety (R2 = 0.14) and depression (R2 = 0.11). In addition, many sociodemographic factors were associated with elevated levels of COVID-19 related impacts, including being younger, female, having lower educational attainment and lower income.
Limitations
The main limitations of the study were its modest sample size, cross sectional design (which precluded inferences about directions of causality), and the relatively high socioeconomic status of the sample (which limited generalisability).
Conclusions
These findings are consistent with a growing body of evidence that suggests that the pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities, and further, point to particular groups that should be supported by post-COVID-19 recovery policies and initiatives.

In this paper, we draw on a body of philosophical literature to analyze a COVID-19 vaccination model, presenting a case study of social and ethical value judgments in health-oriented modelling. This case study urges us to make value judgments in health-oriented models explicit and interpretable by non-experts and to invite public involvement in making them.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 has rapidly spread across the globe. Critical to the control of COVID-19 is the characterisation of its epidemiology. Despite this, there has been a paucity of evidence from many parts of the world, including Malaysia. We aim to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Malaysia to inform prevention and control policies better.
Methods
Malaysian COVID-19 data was extracted from 16 March 2020 up to 31 May 2021. We estimated the following epidemiological indicators: 7-day incidence rates, 7-day mortality rates, case fatality rates, test positive ratios, testing rates and the time-varying reproduction number (Rt).
Findings
Between 16 March 2020 and 31 May 2021, Malaysia has reported 571,901 cases and 2,796 deaths. Malaysia's average 7-day incidence rate was 26•6 reported infections per 100,000 population (95% CI: 17•8, 38•1). The average test positive ratio and testing rate were 4•3% (95% CI: 1•6, 10•2) and 0•8 tests per 1,000 population (95% CI: <0•1, 3•7), respectively. The case fatality rates (CFR) was 0•6% (95% CI: <0•1, 3•7). Among the 2,796 cases who died, 87•3% were ≥ 50 years.
Interpretation
The public health response was successful in the suppression of COVID-19 transmission or the first half of 2020. However, a state election and outbreaks in institutionalised populations have been the catalyst for more significant community propagation. This rising community transmission has continued in 2021, leading to increased incidence and strained healthcare systems. Calibrating NPI based on epidemiological indicators remain critical for us to live with the virus. (243 words)

AB  - Introduction
COVID-19 infection in pregnancy ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe disease. However, the maternal and pregnancy outcomes are primarily favorable. Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI) score is a Visual Triage Checklist for Acute Respiratory symptoms created by the ministry of health of Saudi Arabia 12 to screen the patient for acute respiratory infection with MERS-CoV. It has been used during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify suspected cases and place patients in isolation precautions if the score is≥ 4.
Method
This study is a cross-sectional study of all pregnant women who tested positive for COVID-19 in four medical centers located in four different cities in Saudi Arabia. The study period was from 1/3/2020 until 31/10/2020. Outcomes investigated were the prevalence of COVID infection in pregnant women at the time of delivery. Rate of asymptomatic disease, different maternal and pregnancy outcomes. Women were divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic groups according to the ARI score. The two groups were compared in maternal, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes. Furthermore, the cohort was divided according to maternal age into two groups: women of advanced maternal age ≥ 35 years and younger. The two groups were compared in maternal, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes
Results
During the study period, 9573 women gave birth at KAMCs, and 402 pregnant women were identified as COVID positive. Out of all COVID-positive women, only 394 women gave birth at KAMCs. The screening for COVID infection differed between the centers, but the testing was the same by the Nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab. In Riyadh, screening was based on ARI scoring at the beginning of the pandemic. Then, it became universal. In Jeddah, the screening was based on ARI scoring. Any woman who scored four or more was labeled as suspected, and she was tested. Finally, in Madinah and Dammam, the screening was universal throughout the study. The prevalence of COVID-19 infection among women who gave birth at KAMCs was 4.2% (402/9573). (CI 3.8–4.6%). At the time of diagnosis, most women (62%) were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath. Twenty-two women (5.5%) had Pneumonia, and five women (1.3%) needed admission to Intensive care units (ICU). One woman died due to respiratory failure. When pregnancy outcomes were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic women, pregnancy in symptomatic women was more likely to be complicated by Abortion (6 versus 2% p-value 0.00), fetal death (3 versus 1.3%), and cesarean delivery (30.8 versus 22.4%, p-value 0.001). COVID-positive pregnant women of advanced maternal age (AMA) were more likely to be symptomatic, have Abortion (5 versus 1%, p-value 0.01), and have Preterm delivery (17 versus 11% p-value 0.01) than younger women. In addition, neonatal death was more common in AMA COVID-positive women than younger (4 versus 0%), regardless of COVID-related symptoms.
Conclusion
Most of the COVID-infected pregnant women are asymptomatic. Therefore, the ARI scoring system does not help to triage patients. Symptomatic women, especially those older than 35, tend to have a higher maternal and pregnancy complication rate.

AB  - The highly pathogenic, novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has emerged as a once-in-a-century pandemic with poor consequences, urgently calling for new therapeutics, cures, and supportive interventions. It has already affected over 250 million people worldwide; thereby, there is a need for novel therapies to alleviate the related complications. There is a paradigm shift in developing drugs and clinical practices to combat COVID-19. Several clinical trials have been performed or are testing diverse pharmacological interventions to alleviate viral load and complications such as cytokine release storm (CRS). Kinase-inhibitors have appeared as potential antiviral agents for COVID-19 patients due to their efficacy against CRS. Combination of kinase inhibitors with other therapies can achieve more efficacy against COVID-19. Based on the pre-clinical trials, kinase inhibitors such as Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) inhibitors, Brutton's tyrosin kinase (BTK) inhibitors, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) inhibitors, Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) inhibitors can be a promising strategy against COVID-19. Kinase inhibitors possess crucial pharmacological properties for a successful re-purposing in terms of dual anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects. This review will address the current clinical evidence and the newest discovery regarding the application of kinase inhibitors in COVID-19. An outlook on ongoing clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov) and unpublished data is also presented here. Besides, Kinase inhibitors' function on COVID-19-mediated CRS is discussed.

AB  - The recent outbreak of COVID-19 is attributed to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This viral disease is rapidly spreading across the globe, including India. The mainstay in managing the disease is supportive care, nutrition, and preventing further progression in the absence of proven antiviral drugs. Currently two vaccines Covishield and Covaxin are administered in India. Long-term plans of developing most reliable mRNA-based vaccines are also underway for the future method of prophylaxis. The Siddha system of medicine's holistic approach emphasizes lifestyle modification, prophylactic interventions, and dietary management to boost the host immunity and treatment with herbal medicines and higher-order medicines as the case may be. In this review, a brief outline of the disease COVID-19, Coronavirus, evidence-based traditional Siddha interventions for respiratory ailments and immune boosters highlighting the relevant published research on individual herbs are dealt, which pave way for further research on drug repurposing for COVID-19. Historical evidence on the prevention and treatment of infections especially antivirals in Siddha classics is studied.

AB  - Clinical, laboratory, and autopsy findings support an association between coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and thromboembolic disease. Acute COVID-19 infection is characterized by mononuclear cell reactivity and pan-endothelialitis, contributing to a high incidence of thrombosis in large and small blood vessels, both arterial and venous. Observational studies and randomized trials have investigated whether full-dose anticoagulation may improve outcomes compared with prophylactic dose heparin. Although no benefit for therapeutic heparin has been found in patients who are critically ill hospitalized with COVID-19, some studies support a possible role for therapeutic anticoagulation in patients not yet requiring intensive care unit support. We summarize the pathology, rationale, and current evidence for use of anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 and describe the main design elements of the ongoing FREEDOM COVID-19 Anticoagulation trial, in which 3,600 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 not requiring intensive care unit level of care are being randomized to prophylactic-dose enoxaparin vs therapeutic-dose enoxaparin vs therapeutic-dose apixaban.

AB  - Vaccine Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a very rare but serious adverse reaction to the Oxford–AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson (J&J) vaccines but not observed in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. It is immunologically and clinically almost identical to Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). However patients with VITT have no history of heparin exposure. The antigen provocateur has remained elusive. It has been suggested that it is vaccine DNA. However this does not necessarily explain why vaccine RNA is non-causative and why it is not reported as frequently in wild-type virus infection. Evidence suggests that it is the double stranded DNA specifically of the adenovirus vectors used in the Oxford-AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines; combined with the elimination of the E3 gene domain to promote immunity, that are responsible for VITT. We explain why the RNA vaccines are not implicated in the phenomenon. HIT is not exclusive to heparin but rather a patho-immunological response that can occur to others poly-anions of a particular charge and steric configuration. More appropriate terminology for HIT and VITT may be poly-anionic induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (PITT).

AB  - Background
The risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) varies significantly among persons of similar age and is higher in males. Age-independent, sex-biased differences in susceptibility to severe COVID-19 may be ascribable to deficits in a sexually dimorphic protective attribute that we termed immunologic resilience (IR).
Objective
We sought to examine whether deficits in IR that antedate or are induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection independently predict COVID-19 mortality.
Methods
IR levels were quantified with 2 novel metrics: immune health grades (IHG-I [best] to IHG-IV) to gauge CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell count equilibrium, and blood gene expression signatures. IR metrics were examined in a prospective COVID-19 cohort (n = 522); primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Associations of IR metrics with outcomes in non–COVID-19 cohorts (n = 13,461) provided the framework for linking pre–COVID-19 IR status to IR during COVID-19, as well as to COVID-19 outcomes.
Results
IHG-I, tracking high-grade equilibrium between CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell counts, was the most common grade (73%) among healthy adults, particularly in females. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with underrepresentation of IHG-I (21%) versus overrepresentation (77%) of IHG-II or IHG-IV, especially in males versus females (P < .01). Presentation with IHG-I was associated with 88% lower mortality, after controlling for age and sex; reduced risk of hospitalization and respiratory failure; lower plasma IL-6 levels; rapid clearance of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 burden; and gene expression signatures correlating with survival that signify immunocompetence and controlled inflammation. In non–COVID-19 cohorts, IR-preserving metrics were associated with resistance to progressive influenza or HIV infection, as well as lower 9-year mortality in the Framingham Heart Study, especially in females.
Conclusions
Preservation of immunocompetence with controlled inflammation during antigenic challenges is a hallmark of IR and associates with longevity and AIDS resistance. Independent of age, a male-biased proclivity to degrade IR before and/or during SARS-CoV-2 infection predisposes to severe COVID-19.

AB  - Cardiovascular wellbeing has been dramatically affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the reason for the coronavirus disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. There is a greater risk of morbidity and death in individuals with preexisting heart diseases. Clinical syndromes of the acute coronary syndrome, acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, heart failure, and venous thromboembolism can, directly and indirectly, affect the heart. There may also be adverse heart effects of specific therapeutics under review for COVID-19. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) mechanism in virus replication makes it essential to understand the consequences of the system-modulating medications. For optimum patient care, detailed knowledge of specific cardiovascular symptoms of COVID-19 and the role of RAAS in the prognosis of COVID-19 disease is necessary.

AB  - In this paper, we study the impact of news and sentiments related to covid-19 on United Kingdom (UK)'s stock returns from February 4, 2020 to December 7, 2020. Our results show that covid-19 daily cases exert a significant negative effect on stock returns whereas covid-19 daily deaths have a significant positive impact. These findings hold when covid-related news and sentiments indices are controlled with the 2nd wave data, and when the US policies and equity market volatilities from infectious diseases are used as controls. The magnitude of the effect of covid cases and deaths indicates that the pandemic is not very harmful to the UK stock market.

AB  - Background
Misinformation is known to affect norms, attitudes, and intentions to engage with healthy behaviors. Evidence strongly supports that Spanish speakers may be particularly affected by misinformation and its outcomes, yet current insights into the scope and scale of misinformation is primarily ethnocentric, with greater emphasis on English-language design.
Objective
This study applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze a corpus of English/Spanish tweets about vaccines, broadly defined, for misinformation indicators.
Methods
We analyzed NEnglish = 247,140 and NSpanish = 104,445 tweets using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic models with Coherence score calculation (model fit) with a Mallet adjustment (topic optimization). We used informal coding to name computer-identified topics and compare misinformation scope and scale between languages.
Results
The LDA analysis yielded a 12-topic solution for English and a 14-topic solution for Spanish. Both corpora contained overlapping misinformation, including uncertainty of research guiding policy recommendations or standing in support of antivax movements. However, the Spanish data were positioned in a global context, where misinformation was directed at government equity and disparate vaccine distribution.
Conclusion
Our findings support that misinformation is a global issue. However, misinformation may vary depending on culture and language. As such, tailored strategies to combat misinformation in digital planes are strongly encouraged.

AB  - Background
Hyperhemolysis syndrome (HHS) is an uncommon transfusion reaction described in several hematologic disorders, including sickle cell disease (SCD). HHS is characterized by a decline in hemoglobin (Hb) values below pre-transfusion levels following transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs), coupled with laboratory markers consistent with hemolysis. The proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying HHS include increased phosphatidylserine expression, macrophage activation, and complement dysregulation. Many pathophysiologic mechanisms thought to contribute to HHS have been similarly described in cases of severe COVID-19.
Case report
A 28-year-old male with a history of HbSS presented with shortness of breath, right-sided chest pain, and a two-day history of fever. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected SARS-CoV-2 infection with the omicron variant. The patient required an RBC transfusion (pre-transfusion hemoglobin [Hb]5.8 g/dL) with an immediate post-transfusion Hb of 6.3 g/dL. However, Hb rapidly declined to 1.7 g/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) rose to 8701 u/L. The absolute reticulocyte count of 538 × 109/L correspondingly fell to 29 × 109/L. Despite additional RBC transfusions and initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, he expired on Day 9(D9).
Conclusion
Given the similarities in their proposed pathophysiology, patients with SCD and concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection may be predisposed to developing HHS.

AB  - Background
Migrants in high-income countries may be at increased risk of COVID-19 due to their health and social circumstances, yet the extent to which they are affected and their predisposing risk factors are not clearly understood. We did a systematic review to assess clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in migrant populations, indirect health and social impacts, and to determine key risk factors.
Methods
We did a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42020222135). We searched multiple databases to 18/11/2020 for peer-reviewed and grey literature on migrants (foreign-born) and COVID-19 in 82 high-income countries. We used our international networks to source national datasets and grey literature. Data were extracted on primary outcomes (cases, hospitalisations, deaths) and we evaluated secondary outcomes on indirect health and social impacts and risk factors using narrative synthesis.
Results
3016 data sources were screened with 158 from 15 countries included in the analysis (35 data sources for primary outcomes: cases [21], hospitalisations [4]; deaths [15]; 123 for secondary outcomes). We found that migrants are at increased risk of infection and are disproportionately represented among COVID-19 cases. Available datasets suggest a similarly disproportionate representation of migrants in reported COVID-19 deaths, as well as increased all-cause mortality in migrants in some countries in 2020. Undocumented migrants, migrant health and care workers, and migrants housed in camps have been especially affected. Migrants experience risk factors including high-risk occupations, overcrowded accommodation, and barriers to healthcare including inadequate information, language barriers, and reduced entitlement.
Conclusions
Migrants in high-income countries are at high risk of exposure to, and infection with, COVID-19. These data are of immediate relevance to national public health and policy responses to the pandemic. Robust data on testing uptake and clinical outcomes in migrants, and barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination, are urgently needed, alongside strengthening engagement with diverse migrant groups.

The significant morbidity and mortality of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) prompted a global race to develop new therapies. These include interventions using cell- or cell-derived products, several of which are being tested in well-designed, properly controlled clinical trials. Yet, the search for cell-based COVID-19 treatments has also been fraught with hyperbolic claims; flouting of crucial regulatory, scientific, and ethical norms; and distorted communication of research findings. In this paper, we critically examine ethical issues and public communication challenges related to the development of cell-based therapeutics for COVID-19. Drawing on the lessons learned from this ongoing process, we argue against the rushed development of cell-based interventions. We conclude by outlining ways to improve the ethical conduct of cell-based clinical investigations and public communication of therapeutic claims.

AB  - Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 2 million deaths globally. Two interconnected stages of disease are generally recognised; an initial viral stage and a subsequent immune response phase with the clinical characteristics of hyperinflammation associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, many immune modulators and immunosuppressive drugs, which are widely used in rheumatological practice, have been proposed as treatments for patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. In this Review, we provide an overview of what is currently known about the efficacy and safety of antirheumatic therapies for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Dexamethasone has been shown to reduce COVID-19 related mortality, interleukin-6 inhibitors to reduce risk of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support, and baricitinib to reduce time to recovery in hospitalised patients requiring oxygen support. Further studies are needed to identify whether there is any role for glucocorticoids in patients with less severe COVID-19. Although evidence on the use of other antirheumatic drugs has suggested some benefits, results from adequately powered clinical trials are urgently needed. The heterogeneity in dosing and the absence of uniform inclusion criteria and defined stage of disease studied in many clinical trials have affected the conclusions and comparability of trial results. However, after the success of dexamethasone in proving the anti-inflammatory hypothesis, the next 12 months will undoubtedly bring further clarity about the clinical utility and optimal dose and timing of other anti-rheumatic drugs in the management of COVID-19.

AB  - Pregnancy-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is fast becoming a growing and clinically relevant subgroup of ARDS amidst global outbreaks of various viral respiratory pathogens that include H1N1-influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the most recent COVID-19 pandemic. Pregnancy is a risk factor for severe viral-induced ARDS and commonly associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes including fetal growth-restriction, preterm birth, and spontaneous abortion. Physiologic changes of pregnancy further compounded by mechanical and immunologic alterations are theorized to impact the development of ARDS from viral pneumonia. The COVID-19 sub-phenotype of ARDS share overlapping molecular features of maternal pathogenicity of pregnancy with respect to immune-dysregulation and endothelial/microvascular injury (i.e., preeclampsia) that may in part explain a trend toward poor maternal and fetal outcomes seen with severe COVID-19 maternal infections. To date, current ARDS diagnostic criteria and treatment management fail to include and consider physiologic adaptations that are unique to maternal physiology of pregnancy and consideration of maternal-fetal interactions. Treatment focused on lung-protective ventilation strategies have been shown to improve clinical outcomes in adults with ARDS but may have adverse maternal-fetal interactions when applied in pregnancy-related ARDS. No specific pharmacotherapy has been identified to improve outcomes in pregnancy with ARDS. Adjunctive therapies aimed at immune-modulation and anti-viral treatment with COVID-19 infection during pregnancy have been reported but data in regard to its efficacy and safety is currently lacking.

AB  - While it took decades to arrive to a conclusion that ferritin is more than an indicator of iron storage level, it took a short period of time through the COVID-19 pandemic to wonder what the reason behind high levels of ferritin in patients with severe COVID-19 might be. Unsurprisingly, acute phase reactant was not a satisfactory explanation. Moreover, the behavior of ferritin in patients with severe COVID-19 and the subsequent high mortality rates in patients with high ferritin levels necessitated further investigations to understand the role of ferritin in the diseases. Ferritin was initially described to accompany various acute infections, both viral and bacterial, indicating an acute response to inflammation. However, with the introduction of the hyperferritinemic syndrome connecting four severe pathological conditions such as adult-onset Still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and septic shock added another aspect of ferritin where it could have a pathogenetic role rather than an extremely elevated protein only. In fact, suggesting that COVID-19 is a new member in the spectrum of hyperferritinemic syndrome besides the four mentioned conditions could hopefully direct further search on the pathogenetic role of ferritin. Doubtlessly, improving our understanding of those aspects of ferritin would enormously contribute to better coping with severe diseases in terms of treatment and prevention of complications. The origin, history, importance, and the advances of searching the role of ferritin in various pathological and clinical processes are presented hereby in our article. In addition, the implications of ferritin in COVID-19 are addressed.

Cellular pathology – through autopsy - has depicted the main features: viral pneumonitis, acute lung injury, organising pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, thrombophilia and infarction, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome with multi-organ failure. These are similar to another viral pandemic of the 20th century, H1N1 influenza; but contrast with the second major more complicated pandemic, that of HIV/AIDS. The outcomes of these infections are compared, along with seasonal influenza and SARS-1-CoV disease. Work to be done on COVID-19 includes characterisation of the emerging ‘long COVID’ syndrome, and monitoring the complications of therapies and vaccination programs.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated global pandemic resulting in >400 million infections worldwide and several million deaths. The continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to potentially evade vaccines and monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapies and the limited number of authorized small-molecule antivirals necessitates the need for development of new drug treatments. There remains an unmet medical need for effective and convenient treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that depends on host intracellular ribonucleotide pools for its replication. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a ubiquitous host enzyme that is required for de novo pyrimidine synthesis. The inhibition of DHODH leads to a depletion of intracellular pyrimidines, thereby impacting viral replication in vitro. Brequinar (BRQ) is an orally available, selective, and potent low nanomolar inhibitor of human DHODH that has been shown to exhibit broad spectrum inhibition of RNA virus replication. However, host cell nucleotide salvage pathways can maintain intracellular pyrimidine levels and compensate for BRQ-mediated DHODH inhibition. In this report, we show that the combination of BRQ and the salvage pathway inhibitor dipyridamole (DPY) exhibits strong synergistic antiviral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 by enhanced depletion of the cellular pyrimidine nucleotide pool. The combination of BRQ and DPY showed antiviral activity against the prototype SARS-CoV-2 as well as the Beta (B.1.351) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants. These data support the continued evaluation of the combination of BRQ and DPY as a broad-spectrum, host-acting antiviral strategy to treat SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other RNA virus infections.

AB  - Prior to COVID-19, only two human-tropic coronaviruses resulted in epidemics and cerebrovascular disease was rarely reported. Evidence now suggests that 1–6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients develop stroke. According to some reports, stroke risk is more than sevenfold greater in patients with COVID-19 than influenza. Concerningly, outcomes of COVID-19-related stroke are often worse than in stroke patients without COVID-19 from the same cohorts. In this review, we highlight the emerging association between COVID-19 and stroke and discuss putative pathogenetic mechanisms. Etiology of stroke in COVID-19 patients is likely multifactorial, related to coagulopathy, inflammation, platelet activation, and alterations to the vascular endothelium. Significant work remains to be done to better understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related stroke and for designing optimal primary and secondary prevention strategies.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a serious threat to global public health, demanding urgent action and causing unprecedented worldwide change in a short space of time. This disease has devastated economies, infringed on individual freedoms, and taken an unprecedented toll on healthcare systems worldwide. As of 1 April 2020, over a million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 204 countries and territories, resulting in more than 51,000 deaths. Yet, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, lies an older, insidious disease with a much greater mortality. Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death by a single infectious agent and remains a potent threat to millions of people around the world. We discuss the differences between the two pandemics at present, consider the potential impact of COVID-19 on TB case management, and explore the opportunities that the COVID-19 response presents for advancing TB prevention and control now and in future.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has been a continual challenge since 2020, and it continues to impact people and industries as a disaster caused by a biological hazard. This study examined universal health coverage (UHC) scores in relation to the performance in combating COVID-19 in the Southeast Asian region (SEAR) and the Western Pacific region (WPR), along with the State Party Self-Assessment Annual Reporting (SPAR) index under the international health regulations (IHC). The numbers of infections and deaths per million population from December 2019 to June 2022 were used as primary outcomes to measure countries’ performance. Countries with UHC scores of 63 or higher had a significantly lower number of infected patients and deaths. In addition, several inter-capacity correlations within the SPAR capacities, including with C8 (the National Health Emergency Framework), as well as a very strong correlation to C4 (Food Safety), C5 (Laboratory), and C7 (Human Resources). Furthermore, C9 (Health Service Provisions) has a very strong correlation to C1 (Legislation and Financing), C2 (International Health Regulation Coordination and a National IHR Focal Point function), and C4 (Food Safety), suggesting that the capability to manage an emerging infectious disease form blocks of capacities. In conclusion, UHC clearly mitigated the health-related consequences of COVID-19 in South-East Asia Region (SEAR) and Western Pacific Region (WPR). Investigating the correlation between the SPAR capacities and UHC is a promising approach for future research, including the importance of the provision of health services, points of entry, and, most importantly, risk communications as critical factors for managing pandemic. This study constitutes a good opportunity to apply the SPAR index to define which capacities correlate with the outcome of the pandemic in terms of infections and deaths.

AB  - Despite the development of a number of vaccines for COVID-19, there remains a need for prevention and treatment of the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the ensuing disease COVID-19. This report discusses the key elements of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 that can be readily treated: viral entry, the immune system and inflammation, and the cytokine storm. It is shown that the essential nutrients zinc, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), vitamin D and magnesium provide the ideal combination for prevention and treatment of COVID-19: prevention of SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells, prevention of proliferation of SARS-CoV-2, inhibition of excessive inflammation, improved control of the regulation of the immune system, inhibition of the cytokine storm, and reduction in the effects of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and associated non-communicable diseases. It is emphasized that the non-communicable diseases associated with COVID-19 are inherently more prevalent in the elderly than the young, and that the maintenance of sufficiency of zinc, ω-3 PUFAs, vitamin D and magnesium is essential for the elderly to prevent the occurrence of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases and cancer. Annual checking of levels of these essential nutrients is recommended for those over 65 years of age, together with appropriate adjustments in their intake, with these services and supplies being at government cost. The cost:benefit ratio would be huge as the cost of the nutrients and the testing of their levels would be very small compared with the cost savings of specialists and hospitalization.

AB  - Summary
Background
Public health emergencies can disrupt the provision of and access to essential health-care services, exacerbating health crises. We aimed to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on essential health-care services in Kenya.
Methods
Using county-level data routinely collected from the health information system from health facilities across the country, we used a robust mixed-effect model to examine changes in 17 indicators of essential health services across four periods: the pre-pandemic period (from January, 2018 to February, 2020), two pandemic periods (from March to November 2020, and February to October, 2021), and the period during the COVID-19-associated health-care workers’ strike (from December, 2020 to January, 2021).
Findings
In the pre-pandemic period, we observed a positive trend for multiple indicators. The onset of the pandemic was associated with statistically significant decreases in multiple indicators, including outpatient visits (28·7%; 95% CI 16·0–43·5%), cervical cancer screening (49·8%; 20·6–57·9%), number of HIV tests conducted (45·3%; 23·9–63·0%), patients tested for malaria (31·9%; 16·7–46·7%), number of notified tuberculosis cases (26·6%; 14·7–45·1%), hypertension cases (10·4%; 6·0–39·4%), vitamin A supplements (8·7%; 7·9–10·5%), and three doses of the diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis vaccine administered (0·9%; 0·5–1·3%). Pneumonia cases reduced by 50·6% (31·3–67·3%), diarrhoea by 39·7% (24·8–62·7%), and children attending welfare clinics by 39·6% (23·5–47·1%). Cases of sexual violence increased by 8·0% (4·3–25·0%). Skilled deliveries, antenatal care, people with HIV infection newly started on antiretroviral therapy, confirmed cases of malaria, and diabetes cases detected were not significantly affected negatively. Although most of the health indicators began to recover during the pandemic, the health-care workers’ strike resulted in nearly all indicators falling to numbers lower than those observed at the onset or during the pre-strike pandemic period.
Interpretation
The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated health-care workers’ strike in Kenya have been associated with a substantial disruption of essential health services, with the use of outpatient visits, screening and diagnostic services, and child immunisation adversely affected. Efforts to maintain the provision of these essential health services during a health-care crisis should target the susceptible services to prevent the exacerbation of associated disease burdens during such health crises.

AB  - The novel coronavirus pandemic has radically changed the landscape of normal surgical practice. Lifesaving cancer surgery, however, remains a clinical priority, and there is an increasing need to fully define the optimal oncologic management of patients with varying stages of lung cancer, allowing prioritization of which thoracic procedures should be performed in the current era. Healthcare providers and managers should not ignore the risk of a bimodal peak of mortality in patients with lung cancer; an imminent spike due to mortality from acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, and a secondary peak reflecting an excess of cancer-related mortality among patients whose treatments were deemed less urgent, delayed, or cancelled. The European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Thoracic Anesthesia Subspecialty group has considered these challenges and developed an updated set of expert recommendations concerning the infectious period, timing of surgery, vaccination, preoperative screening and evaluation, airway management, and ventilation of thoracic surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Summary
One year into the global COVID-19 pandemic, the focus of attention has shifted to the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). After nearly a year of the pandemic with little evolutionary change affecting human health, several variants have now been shown to have substantial detrimental effects on transmission and severity of the virus. Public health officials, medical practitioners, scientists, and the broader community have since been scrambling to understand what these variants mean for diagnosis, treatment, and the control of the pandemic through nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccines. Here we explore the evolutionary processes that are involved in the emergence of new variants, what we can expect in terms of the future emergence of VOCs, and what we can do to minimise their impact.

AB  - Summary
COVID-19 is linked to endotheliopathy and coagulopathy, which can result in multi-organ failure. The mechanisms causing endothelial damage due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain elusive. Here, we developed an infection-competent human vascular organoid from pluripotent stem cells for modeling endotheliopathy. Longitudinal serum proteome analysis identified aberrant complement signature in critically ill patients driven by the amplification cycle regulated by complement factor B and D (CFD). This deviant complement pattern initiates endothelial damage, neutrophil activation, and thrombosis specific to organoid-derived human blood vessels, as verified through intravital imaging. We examined a new long-acting, pH-sensitive (acid-switched) antibody targeting CFD. In both human and macaque COVID-19 models, this long-acting anti-CFD monoclonal antibody mitigated abnormal complement activation, protected endothelial cells, and curtailed the innate immune response post-viral exposure. Collectively, our findings suggest that the complement alternative pathway exacerbates endothelial injury and inflammation. This underscores the potential of CFD-targeted therapeutics against severe viral-induced inflammathrombotic outcomes.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infection associated respiratory disease- COVID-19 has evolved into a pandemic but, being a new form of virus, pathogenesis of disease causation is not fully understood and drugs and vaccines against this virus are still being tested so that no effective drugs or vaccines have been advised by regulatory authority. In this context, the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India has recommended ‘Ayush Kwath’ to improve the immunity and combat the infection. Our objective of this literature review is to review the role of immunity in pathogenesis of COVID-19 and role of Ayush Kwath against the virus and regulation of immunity. Current review was conducted using a search of available literature on COVID-19 and immunity, Vyadhikshamatwa, Ayurveda and COVID-19, Rasayana, Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, immunomodulatory effects of medicinal plants; Tulsi/Holy Basil/Ocimum sanctum, Dalchini/Cinnamon/Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Sunthi/Ginger/Zingiber officinale and Marich/Black Pepper/Piper nigrum. Ayurveda, being an ancient science have both medicinal and cultural values and had stimulated our kitchen and influenced what we ate in different seasons and the remedies we used for common ailments. Herbs such as Tulsi, Marich, Sunthi, Dalchini are the most commonly used and easily available drugs in home. Thus, Ayush Kwath due to its immune-modulatory, antiviral, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet, anti-atherosclerotic, hepato-protective, reno-protective properties; seems to be effective in immuno-regulation for controlling viral infections like COVID-19. Further pre-clinical and clinical trials need to be done for the evaluation of safety and efficacy of this polyherbal formulation.

AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and the ensuing global pandemic, has resulted in an unprecedented response to identify therapies that can limit uncontrolled inflammation observed in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. The immune pathology behind COVID-19 is complex and involves the activation and interaction of multiple systems including, but not limited to, complement, inflammasomes, endothelial as well as innate and adaptive immune cells to bring about a convoluted profile of inflammation, coagulation and tissue damage. To date, therapeutic approaches have focussed on inhibition of coagulation, untargeted immune suppression and/or cytokine-directed blocking agents. Regardless of recently achieved improvements in individual patient outcomes and survival rates, improved and focussed approaches targeting individual systems involved is needed to further improve prognosis and wellbeing. This review summarizes the current understanding of molecular and cellular systems involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, and their contribution to pathogen clearance and damage to then discuss possible therapeutic options involving immunomodulatory drug delivery systems as well as summarising the complex interplay between them.

AB  - Aotearoa New Zealand has been identified, by several measures, as being one of a few developed countries that have weathered the COVID‐19 pandemic in the best possible way. This outcome is generally attributed to strict but effective public health measures that included – besides very high vaccination rates – national and regional lockdowns, as well as total closure of the border except for returning citizens (who were subject to mandatory quarantining). Concurrent fiscal and monetary policies contributed to economic outcomes that remained remarkably buoyant. In this paper we assess the importance of public interventions in New Zealand triggered by the pandemic relative to the mitigating effects of the country being an island nation with a small population scale, low population density and remote location. We summarize the recent international literature, estimate simple but representative cross‐country regression models, and provide a qualitative evaluation of the public policy response. We find that the favourable effects of low average population density, remoteness and the absence of land borders have indeed been of great benefit. Geography assisted in the effectiveness of the elimination strategy which was only abandoned in favour of a mitigation strategy once the less severe but highly contagious Omicron variants arrived in early 2022. Hence, while a remote and peripheral location is generally seen as economically disadvantageous, during a pandemic it delays the spread of a viral disease and provides the opportunity to focus on interventions to maintain economic activity, develop effective public health responses and learn from the experience of less remote nations.
Resumen
Aotearoa Nueva Zelanda ha sido identificada, según varios estudios, como uno de los pocos países desarrollados que han capeado la pandemia de COVID‐19 de la mejor manera posible. Este resultado se atribuye generalmente a las estrictas pero eficaces medidas de salud pública que incluyeron, junto con tasas de vacunación muy elevadas, confinamientos nacionales y regionales, así como el cierre total de su frontera excepto para los ciudadanos que regresaban, sujetos a cuarentena obligatoria. Las políticas fiscales y monetarias concomitantes contribuyeron a unos resultados económicos que se mantuvieron notablemente boyantes. En este artículo se evaluó la importancia de las intervenciones públicas en Nueva Zelanda desencadenadas por la pandemia en relación con los efectos atenuantes de que el país sea una nación insular con una escala de población pequeña, baja densidad de población y una ubicación remota. Se resumió la bibliografía internacional reciente, se estimaron modelos de regresión entre países sencillos pero representativos y se ofreció una evaluación cualitativa de la respuesta de las políticas públicas. Se comprobó que los efectos favorables de la baja densidad media de la población, la lejanía y la ausencia de fronteras terrestres fueron notablemente beneficiosos. La geografía contribuyó a la eficacia de la estrategia de eliminación, que sólo se abandonó en favor de una estrategia de mitigación una vez que a principios de 2022 llegaron las variantes Omicron, menos graves pero altamente contagiosas. Por lo tanto, aunque una ubicación remota y periférica suele considerarse económicamente desventajosa, durante una pandemia retrasa la propagación de una enfermedad vírica y brinda la oportunidad de plantear intervenciones centradas en mantener la actividad económica, desarrollar respuestas eficaces de salud pública y aprender de la experiencia de las naciones menos remotas.
抄録
アオテアロア・ニュージーランドは、複数の対策によって、新型コロナウイルス感染症のパンデミックを可能な限り最善の方法で乗り切った数少ない先進国の1つであると認識されている。これは概して、非常に高いワクチン接種率、国及び地域のロックダウン、帰国した国民 (強制隔離の対象となった)を除く全面的な国境閉鎖など、厳格ではあるが効果的な公衆衛生対策による結果である。財政政策と金融政策を同時に実施することで経済的成果が得られ、経済は著しい上昇傾向を保持していた。本稿では、ニュージーランドは人口規模が小さく、人口密度が低く、遠隔地にある島国であることによる緩和効果に対する、パンデミックによって引き起こされたニュージーランドにおける公的介入の重要性を評価する。最近の国際的な研究論文を要約し、単純だが典型的なクロスカントリーな回帰モデルを推定し、公共政策の効果の定性的評価を実施する。人口密度が平均的に低いこと、遠隔地であること、そして地上での国境が存在しないことによる好ましい効果が、実に大きな利益となっていることがわかる。地理的要因は排除的政策の有効性を支持するが、2022年初頭にそれほど深刻ではないが感染力の強いオミクロン変異株が登場すると、緩和政策が支持されて、排除的政策は放棄された。つまり、遠隔地や辺境地は、一般的に経済的に不利であると見られているが、パンデミックの間はウイルス性疾患の蔓延を遅らせ、経済活動を維持するための介入を行い、効果的な公衆衛生対策を開発し、それほど遠隔地ではない国の経験から学ぶことに注力する機会を提供してくれる。

We conducted quality of life online surveys in France, India, Italy, UK and the United States of America between June 21st and September 13th 2021, and used regression models to estimate the average quality of life loss due to light and severe restrictions in these countries. We then combined estimated disutility weights from the pooled sample with the latest data on Covid-19 restrictions exposure in each country to estimate the total disutility generated by restrictions at the national, regional and global level. We also embedded a discrete choice experiment (DCE) into the online survey to estimate average willingness to pay to avoid specific restrictions.
Findings
A total of 947 surveys were completed. Thirty-five percent of respondents were female, and 69.5% were between 18 and 39 years old. The weighted average utility weight was 0.71 (95% CIs 0.69–0.74) for light restrictions, and 0.65 (0.63–0.68) for severe restrictions. At the global scale, this implies a total loss of 3259 million QALYs (95% 3021, 3496) as of September 6th, 2021, with the highest burden in lower and upper middle-income countries. Utility losses appear to be particularly large for closures of schools and daycares as well as restaurants and bars, and seem relatively small for wearing masks and travel restrictions.
Interpretation
The results presented here suggest that the QALY losses due to restrictions are substantial. Future mitigation strategies should try to balance potential reductions in disease transmission achievable through specific measures against their respective impact on quality of life. Additional research is needed to determine differences in restriction-specific disutilities across countries, and to determine optimal policy responses to similar future disease threats.

AB  - ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
The covid-19 pandemic disproportionately affected certain vulnerable communities. The purpose of our study was to determine how covid-19 affected the socioeconomic demographics of breast imaging patients at a major comprehensive cancer center.
METHODS
This retrospective cohort study compared female patients who underwent screening mammograms, diagnostic mammograms, breast ultrasound, or breast MRI during the following time periods: Pre-pandemic (February 1, 2018 through February 29, 2020), acute pandemic (March 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020), subacute pandemic (August 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020), and chronic pandemic (January 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022). Statistics were performed using the generalized estimating equations approach.
RESULTS
74,398 female patients (mean age 55.6 ± 12.4 years) underwent 238,776 total breast imaging examinations. For screening mammograms, Hispanics represented 27.1% (9197 of 33,960) of patients in the pre-pandemic time period compared with 16.7% (604 of 3621) in the acute pandemic time period, 18.7% (1835 of 9830) in the subacute pandemic time period, and 24.3% (7492 of 30,869) in the chronic pandemic time period (p-values<0.0001). Self-pay patients saw similar declines for screening mammograms during the same time periods: 21.7% (7375 of 33,960), 7.9% (286 of 3621), 9.5% (933 of 9830), and 17.4% (5357 of 30,869), respectively (all p-values<0.0001 compared with the pre-pandemic time period). Similarly dramatic trends were not observed for race or other imaging examinations.
DISCUSSION
At our cancer center, Hispanics and self-pay patients were disproportionately affected by the covid-19 pandemic. Strategies to improve health inequities are needed.

AB  - Since 2019, COVID-19 has become the most important health dilemma around the world. The dysregulated immune response which results in ARDS and cytokine storm has an outstanding role in the progression of pulmonary damage in COVID-19. IL-6, through induction of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, is the pioneer of the hyperinflammatory condition and cytokine storm in severe COVID-19. Therefore, IL-6 pathway blockade is considered an emerging approach with high efficacy to reduce lung damage in COVID-19. This article aims to review the pleiotropic roles of the IL-6 pathway in lung damage and ARDS in severe COVID-19, and the rationale for IL-6 signaling blockade at different levels, including IL-6 soluble and membrane receptor pathways, IL-6 downstream signaling (such as JAK-STAT) inhibition, and non-specific anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches. Recent clinical data of each method, with specific concentration on tocilizumab, along with other new drugs, such as sarilumab and siltuximab, have been discussed. Challenges of IL-6 signaling inhibition, such as the risk of superinfection and hepatic injury, and possible solutions have also been explained. Moreover, to achieve the highest efficacy, ongoing clinical trials and special clinical considerations of using different IL-6 inhibitors have been discussed in detail. Special considerations, including the appropriate timing and dosage, monotherapy or combination therapy, and proper side effect managment must be noticed regarding the clinical administration of these drugs. Future studies are still necessary to improve the productivity and unknown aspects of IL-6 signaling blockade for personalized treatment of severe COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
Background
The dynamics of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 are complicated by age-dependent factors, changing levels of infection, and the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as the perceived risk declines, necessitating the use of mathematical models. Our aims were to use epidemiological data from the UK together with estimates of vaccine efficacy to predict the possible long-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 under the planned vaccine rollout.
Methods
In this study, we used a mathematical model structured by age and UK region, fitted to a range of epidemiological data in the UK, which incorporated the planned rollout of a two-dose vaccination programme (doses 12 weeks apart, protection onset 14 days after vaccination). We assumed default vaccine uptake of 95% in those aged 80 years and older, 85% in those aged 50–79 years, and 75% in those aged 18–49 years, and then varied uptake optimistically and pessimistically. Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease was assumed to be 88% on the basis of Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines being administered in the UK, and protection against infection was varied from 0% to 85%. We considered the combined interaction of the UK vaccination programme with multiple potential future relaxations (or removals) of NPIs, to predict the reproduction number (R) and pattern of daily deaths and hospital admissions due to COVID-19 from January, 2021, to January, 2024.
Findings
We estimate that vaccination alone is insufficient to contain the outbreak. In the absence of NPIs, even with our most optimistic assumption that the vaccine will prevent 85% of infections, we estimate R to be 1·58 (95% credible intervals [CI] 1·36–1·84) once all eligible adults have been offered both doses of the vaccine. Under the default uptake scenario, removal of all NPIs once the vaccination programme is complete is predicted to lead to 21 400 deaths (95% CI 1400–55 100) due to COVID-19 for a vaccine that prevents 85% of infections, although this number increases to 96 700 deaths (51 800–173 200) if the vaccine only prevents 60% of infections. Although vaccination substantially reduces total deaths, it only provides partial protection for the individual; we estimate that, for the default uptake scenario and 60% protection against infection, 48·3% (95% CI 48·1–48·5) and 16·0% (15·7–16·3) of deaths will be in individuals who have received one or two doses of the vaccine, respectively.
Interpretation
For all vaccination scenarios we investigated, our predictions highlight the risks associated with early or rapid relaxation of NPIs. Although novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 offer a potential exit strategy for the pandemic, success is highly contingent on the precise vaccine properties and population uptake, both of which need to be carefully monitored.

AB  - Summary
Background
There are a growing number of case reports of various autoimmune diseases occurring after COVID-19, yet there is no large-scale population-based evidence to support this potential association. This study provides a closer insight into the association between COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases and reveals discrepancies across sex, age, and race of participants.
Methods
This is a retrospective cohort study based on the TriNetX U.S. Collaborative Network. In the test-negative design, cases were participants with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results for SARS-CoV-2, while controls were participants who tested negative and were not diagnosed with COVID-19 throughout the follow-up period. Patients with COVID-19 and controls were propensity score-matched (1: 1) for age, sex, race, adverse socioeconomic status, lifestyle-related variables, and comorbidities. The primary endpoint is the incidence of newly recorded autoimmune diseases. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confident intervals (CIs) of autoimmune diseases were calculated between propensity score-matched groups with the use of Cox proportional-hazards regression models.
Findings
Between January 1st, 2020 and December 31st, 2021, 3,814,479 participants were included in the study (888,463 cases and 2,926,016 controls). After matching, the COVID-19 cohort exhibited significantly higher risks of rheumatoid arthritis (aHR:2.98, 95% CI:2.78–3.20), ankylosing spondylitis (aHR:3.21, 95% CI:2.50–4.13), systemic lupus erythematosus (aHR:2.99, 95% CI:2.68–3.34), dermatopolymyositis (aHR:1.96, 95% CI:1.47–2.61), systemic sclerosis (aHR:2.58, 95% CI:2.02–3.28), Sjögren's syndrome (aHR:2.62, 95% CI:2.29–3.00), mixed connective tissue disease (aHR:3.14, 95% CI:2.26–4.36), Behçet's disease (aHR:2.32, 95% CI:1.38–3.89), polymyalgia rheumatica (aHR:2.90, 95% CI:2.36–3.57), vasculitis (aHR:1.96, 95% CI:1.74–2.20), psoriasis (aHR:2.91, 95% CI:2.67–3.17), inflammatory bowel disease (aHR:1.78, 95%CI:1.72–1.84), celiac disease (aHR:2.68, 95% CI:2.51–2.85), type 1 diabetes mellitus (aHR:2.68, 95%CI:2.51–2.85) and mortality (aHR:1.20, 95% CI:1.16–1.24).
Interpretation
COVID-19 is associated with a different degree of risk for various autoimmune diseases. Given the large sample size and relatively modest effects these findings should be replicated in an independent dataset. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Summary
A fraction of patients with COVID-19 develops severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the majority, including high-risk individuals, experience mild symptoms. Severe disease has been associated with higher levels of antibodies and inflammatory cytokines but often among patients with diverse demographics and comorbidity status. This study evaluated hospitalized vs. ambulatory patients with COVID-19 with demographic risk factors for severe COVID-19: median age of 63, >80% male, and >85% black and/or Hispanic. Sera were collected four to 243 days after symptom onset and evaluated for binding and functional antibodies as well as 48 cytokines and chemokines. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels and functions were similar in ambulatory and hospitalized patients. However, a strong correlation between anti-S2 antibody levels and the other antibody parameters, along with higher IL-27 levels, was observed in hospitalized but not ambulatory cases. These data indicate that antibodies against the relatively conserved S2 spike subunit and immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL-27 are potential immune determinants of COVID-19.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Objective: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that resulted in a global pandemic with substantial morbidity and mortality. Currently, there is no specific treatment or approved vaccine against COVID-19. The underlying associated comorbidity and diminished immune function of some pituitary patients (whether caused by the disease and its sequelae or treatment with excess glucocorticoids) increases their risk of contracting and developing complications from COVID-19 infection. Methods: A review of studies in PubMed and Google Scholar published between January 2020 to the time of writing (May 1, 2020) was conducted using the search terms ‘pituitary,’ ‘coronavirus,’ ‘COVID-19’, ‘2019-nCoV’, ‘diabetes mellitus’, ‘obesity’, ‘adrenal,’ and ‘endocrine.’ Results: Older age and pre-existing obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus increase the risk of hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients. Men tend to be more severely affected than women; fortunately, most men, particularly of younger age, survive the infection. In addition to general comorbidities that may apply to many pituitary patients, they are also susceptible due to the following pituitary disorder–specific features: hypercortisolemia and adrenal suppression with Cushing disease, adrenal insufficiency and diabetes insipidus with hypopituitarism, and sleep-apnea syndrome and chest wall deformity with acromegaly. Conclusion: This review aims to focus on the impact of COVID-19 in patients with pituitary disorders. As most countries are implementing mobility restrictions, we also discuss how this pandemic has affected patient attitudes and impacted our decision-making on management recommendations for these patients.

AB  - Several waves of COVID-19 caused by different SARS-CoV-2 variants have been recorded worldwide. During this period, many publications were released describing the influence of various factors, such as environmental, social and economic factors, on the spread of COVID-19. This paper presents the results of a detailed spatiotemporal analysis of the course of COVID-19 cases and deaths in five waves in Poland in relation to green‒blue spaces. The results, based on 380 counties, reveal that the negative correlation between the indicator of green‒blue space per inhabitant and the average daily number of COVID-19 cases and deaths was clearly visible during all waves. These relationships were described by a power equation (coefficient of determination ranging from 0.83 to 0.88) with a high level of significance. The second important discovery was the fact that the rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths were significantly higher in urban counties (low values of the green–blue space indicator in m2/people) than in rural areas. The developed models can be used in decision-making by local government authorities to organize anti-COVID-19 prevention measures, including local lockdowns, especially in urban areas.

AB  - Summary
The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) conveys a serious global threat to health and economy. A common predisposing factor for development to serious progressive disease is presence of a low-grade inflammation, e.g., as seen in diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and heart failure. Micronutrient deficiencies may also contribute to the development of this state. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to explore the role of the nutrition to relieve progression of COVID-19. According PRISMA protocol, we conducted an online databases search including Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar and web of science for published literatures in the era of COVID-19 Outbreak regarding to the status of nutrition and COVID-19 until December 2021. There were available studies (80 studies) providing direct evidence regarding the associations between the status of nutrition and COVID-19 infection. Adequate nutritional supply is essential for resistance against other viral infections and also for improvement of immune function and reduction of inflammation. Hence, it is suggested that nutritional intervention which secures an adequate status might protect against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - coronavirus-2) and mitigate its course. We also recommend initiation of adequate nutritional supplementation in high-risk areas and/or soon after the time of suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2. Subjects in high-risk groups should have high priority for applying this nutritive adjuvant therapy that should be started prior to administration of specific and supportive medical measures.

A literature and policy review was performed to analyze data about the COVID-19 and T2D pandemics to establish their multi-factorial health, social, and economic impacts. With the global prevalence of T2D tripling in the last two decades, T2D has become an MPP largely due to modifiable human behaviors. Certain successful elements of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic provide important lessons that can be adapted for the growing T2D MPP. With proper education and access to resources, it is possible to mitigate the T2D MPP through focused government policies as illustrated by many of the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic response. Without such government intervention, the T2D MPP will continue to grow at an unsustainable pace with enormous health, social and economic implications. Immediate action is necessary. The scale of the T2D pandemic warrants a robust response in health policy as outlined through eight coordinated efforts; the lessons of the COVID-19 crisis should be studied and applied to the T2D MPP.

AB  - Summary
Kidney involvement is common in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), and our understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on short- and long-term kidney outcomes has evolved over the course of the pandemic. Initial key questions centered on the spectrum and degree of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Investigators worldwide have explored the association between COVID-19–associated AKI and short-term outcomes, including inpatient mortality and disease severity. Even as treatments evolved, vaccinations were developed, and newer viral variants arose, subsets of patients were identified as at continued high risk for major adverse kidney outcomes. In this review, we explore key topics of continued relevance including the following: (1) a comparison of COVID-19–associated AKI with AKI developing in other clinical settings; (2) the ongoing controversy over kidney tropism in the setting of COVID-19 and the potential for competitive binding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 to prevent viral cell entry; and (3) the identification of high-risk patients for adverse outcomes to inform long-term outpatient management. Patients at particularly high risk for adverse kidney outcomes include those with APOL1 high-risk genotype status. Biomarkers of injury, inflammation, tubular health, and repair measured in both the blood and urine may hold prognostic significance.

AB  - Objectives
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland has been amongst the most severe in Europe. Serological surveillance is critical to determine the overall extent of infection across populations and to inform the public health response. This study aimed to estimate the proportion of people who have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (‘seroprevalence’) in the general population of Scotland and to see if this changes over time.
Study design/Methods
Between International Organization for Standardization (ISO) week 17 (i.e. week commencing 20th April) and ISO week 25 (week commencing 15 June), 4751 residual blood samples were obtained from regional biochemistry laboratories in six participating regional health authority areas covering approximately 75% of the Scottish population. Samples were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Italy). Seroprevalence rates were adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the assay using Bayesian methods.
Results
The combined adjusted seroprevalence across the study period was 4.3% (95% confidence interval: 4.2%–4.5%). The proportion varied each week between 1.9% and 6.8% with no difference in antibody positivity by age, sex or geographical area.
Conclusions
At the end of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, only a small fraction of the Scottish population had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Control of COVID-19 requires the ability to detect asymptomatic and mild infections that would otherwise remain undetected through existing surveillance systems. This is important to determine the true number of infections within the general population which, in turn, can help to understand transmission, inform control measures and provide a denominator for the estimation of severity measures such as the proportion of infected people who have been hospitalised and/or have died.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a coronavirus-induced illness attributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, is thought to have first emerged on November 17, 2019. According to World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 has been linked to 379,223,560 documented occurrences and 5,693,245 fatalities globally as of 1st Feb 2022. Influenza A virus that has also been discovered diarrhea and gastrointestinal discomfort was found in the infected person, highlighting the need of monitoring them for gastro intestinal tract (GIT) symptoms regardless of whether the sickness is respiration related. The majority of the microbiome in the intestines is Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, while Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes are found in the lungs. Although most people overcome SARS-CoV-2 infections, many people continue to have symptoms months after the original sickness, called Long-COVID or Post COVID. The term “post-COVID-19 symptoms” refers to those that occur with or after COVID-19 and last for more than 12 weeks (long-COVID-19). The possible understanding of biological components such as inflammatory, immunological, metabolic activity biomarkers in peripheral blood is needed to evaluate the study. Therefore, this article aims to review the informative data that supports the idea underlying the disruption mechanisms of the microbiome of the gastrointestinal tract in the acute COVID-19 or post-COVID-mediated elevation of severity biomarkers.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease that has reached pandemic status by rapidly spreading worldwide. Elderly individuals and patients with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension show a higher risk of hospitalization, severe disease, and mortality by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. These patients frequently show exacerbated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines associated with an overreaction of the immune system, the so-called cytokine storm. Host nutritional status plays a pivotal role in the outcome of a variety of different infectious diseases. It is known that the immune system is highly affected by malnutrition, leading to decreased immune responses with consequent augmented risk of infection and disease severity. Body composition, especially low lean mass and high adiposity, has consistently been linked to worsened prognosis in many different diseases. In this review, evidence concerning the impact of nutritional status on viral infection outcomes is discussed.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 is associated with both venous and arterial thrombotic complications. While prophylactic anticoagulation is now widely recommended for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the effectiveness and safety of thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with COVID-19 has not been established.
Study Design
PREVENT-HD is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pragmatic, event-driven phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in symptomatic outpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at risk for thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death. Several challenges posed by the pandemic have necessitated innovative approaches to clinical trial design, start-up, and conduct. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by time from COVID-19 confirmation, to either rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily or placebo for 35 days. The primary efficacy end point is a composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, non-central nervous system systemic embolization, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. The primary safety end point is fatal and critical site bleeding according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition. Enrollment began in August 2020 and is expected to enroll approximately 4,000 participants to yield the required number of end point events.
Conclusions
PREVENT-HD is a pragmatic trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the direct oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban in the outpatient setting to reduce major venous and arterial thrombotic events, hospitalization, and mortality associated with COVID-19.

AB  - Purpose
There is growing evidence regarding the imaging findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in lung ultrasound (LUS), however the use of a combined prognostic and triage tool has yet to be explored. To determine the impact of the LUS in the prediction of the mortality of patients with highly suspected or confirmed COVID-19.The secondary outcome was to calculate a score with LUS findings with other variables to predict hospital admission and emergency department (ED) discharge.
Material and methods
Prospective study performed in the ED of three academic hospitals. Patients with highly suspected or confirmed COVID-19 underwent a LUS examination and laboratory tests.
Results
A total of 228 patients were enrolled between March and September 2020. The mean age was 61.9 years (Standard Deviation – SD 21.1). The most common findings in LUS was a right posteroinferior isolated irregular pleural line (53.9%, 123 patients). A logistic regression model was calculated, including age over 70 years, C-reactive protein (CRP) over 70mg/L and a lung score over 7 to predict mortality, hospital admission and discharge from the ED. We obtained a predictive model with a sensitivity of 56.8% and a specificity of 87.6%, with an AUC of 0.813 [p<0.001].
Conclusions
The combination of LUS, clinical and laboratory findings in this easy to apply “rule of 7” showed excellent performance to predict hospital admission and mortality.
Resumen
Objetivo
Existe una evidencia creciente con respecto a los hallazgos de imagen de la enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) en la ecografía pulmonar (LUS), sin embargo, aún no se ha explorado el uso de una herramienta combinada de pronóstico y triaje. El objetivo principal de este estudio fue determinar el impacto de la LUS en la predicción de la mortalidad de los pacientes con sospecha de afectación pulmonar por COVID-19. El objetivo secundario fue calcular una puntuación con los hallazgos del LUS con otras variables para predecir el ingreso hospitalario y el alta del servicio de urgencias (SU).
Material y métodos
Estudio prospectivo realizado en urgencias de tres hospitales académicos, en pacientes con sospecha de COVID-19 o confirmación de esta, a los que se sometió a un examen de LUS y pruebas de laboratorio.
Resultados
Se inscribieron un total de 228 pacientes entre marzo y septiembre de 2020. La edad media fue de 61,9 años (DE 21,1). El hallazgo más común en la LUS fue la irregularidad pleural posteroinferior derecha (53,9%, 123 pacientes). Se calculó un modelo de regresión logística, que incluyó la edad mayor de 70 años, proteína C reactiva (PCR) mayor de 70 mg/L y puntuación de afectación pulmonar mediante LUS score superior a 7 para predecir la mortalidad, el ingreso hospitalario y el alta del SU. Se obtuvo una sensibilidad del 56,8% y una especificidad del 87,6%, con un AUC de 0,813 [p < 0,001] para dicho modelo predictivo, en materia de mortalidad.
Conclusiones
La combinación de LUS, hallazgos clínicos y de laboratorio en esta «regla de 7» de fácil aplicación se mostró de utilidad para predecir el ingreso hospitalario y la mortalidad.

AB  - Numerous reviews have summarized the epidemiology, pathophysiology and the various therapeutic aspects of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but a practical guide on “how to treat whom with what and when” based on an understanding of the immunological background of the disease stages remains missing. This review attempts to combine the current knowledge about the immunopathology of COVID-19 with published evidence of available and emerging treatment options. We recognize that the information about COVID-19 and its treatment is rapidly changing, but hope that this guide offers those on the frontline of this pandemic an understanding of the host response in COVID-19 patients and supports their ongoing efforts to select the best treatments tailored to their patient's clinical status.

AB  - Covid 19 pandemic has severe implications on health and life of people. Asia being the most populous region has higher fatalities burden. Health infrastructure, stringent preventive measures by the government and public participation through adhering to social distancing have influence to check on fatalities' burden. The level of Social capital as well as voters' participation in a particular country can have influence on containment of COVID cases and fatalities. In this context, the main objectives of this study are to analyse pattern and trend of death burden for 45 Asian countries and impact of stringency measures by government, and voters’ turnout ratio on death burden. However, for regression analysis only 32 countries are taken into account considering the availability of data for all variables. Multiple linear regression analysis is employed in a cross-sectional framework and Ordinary least square estimation technique with heteroscedastic adjusted standard errors have been used for estimation of coefficients. The results show that southern Asia contributes the highest share of fatality cases in total fatality cases of Asia with 71.43% share. It also has the highest share of confirmed cases in total confirmed cases of Asia with 71.72%. However, when we take the population into account, Western Asia leads in the share of confirmed COVID-19 cases and its associated fatality cases per million populations in Asia as compared to other Asian regions. The factors like health infrastructure and voters’ turnover ratio are found to be significant and potential in reducing the new deaths per million populations. Though the coefficient of Stringency index has been negative and it did not emerge to be significant in Asian countries. The COVID related fatalities in Asian region are urban centric and urbanization proxy is found to be positive and significant. Diabetes prevalence rate has some heterogeneous result and in the present study its coefficient is not in the hypothesized direction. . The Countries should ramp up health infrastructure and necessary preparedness to deal with the subsequent waves and COVID related fatalities. Importance need to be given people's participation and their shared responsibilities in dealing with COVID cases and checking on fatalities. The realisation of social responsibility among the masses can lead to community participation and adhering to the protocols imposed by the government and helps in checking on spread of virus and associated death.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is likely to remain endemic globally despite widespread vaccination. There is increasing concern for myocardial involvement and ensuing cardiac complications due to COVID-19, however, the available evidence suggests these risks are low. Pandemic publishing has resulted in rapid manuscript availability though pre-print servers. Subsequent article retractions, a lack of standardised definitions, over-reliance on isolated troponin elevation and the heterogeneity of studied patient groups (i.e. severe vs. symptomatic vs all infections) resulted in early concern for high rates of myocarditis in patients with and recovering from COVID-19. The estimated incidence of myocarditis in COVID-19 infection is 11 cases per 100,000 infections compared with an estimated 2.7 cases per 100,000 persons following mRNA vaccination. For substantiated cases, the clinical course of myocarditis related to COVID-19 or mRNA vaccination appears mild and self-limiting, with reports of severe/fulminant myocarditis being rare. There is limited data available on the management of myocarditis in these settings. Clinical guidance for appropriate use of cardiac investigations and monitoring in COVID-19 is needed for effective risk stratification and efficient use of cardiac resources in Australia. An amalgamation of national and international position statements and guidelines is helpful for guiding clinical practice. This paper reviews the current available evidence and guidelines and provides a summary of the risks and potential use of cardiac investigations and monitoring for patients with COVID-19.

AB  - The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended phased allocation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in December 2020. To support the development of this guidance, we used a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to evaluate the relative impact of three vaccine allocation strategies on infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. All three strategies initially prioritized healthcare personnel (HCP) for vaccination. Strategies of subsequently prioritizing adults aged ≥65 years, or a combination of essential workers and adults aged ≥75 years, prevented the most deaths. Meanwhile, prioritizing adults with high-risk medical conditions immediately after HCP prevented the most infections. All three strategies prevented a similar fraction of hospitalizations. While no model is capable of fully capturing the complex social dynamics which shape epidemics, exercises such as this one can be a useful way for policy makers to formalize their assumptions and explore the key features of a problem before making decisions.
