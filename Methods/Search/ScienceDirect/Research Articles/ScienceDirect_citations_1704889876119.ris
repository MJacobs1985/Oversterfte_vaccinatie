AB  - Background
The safety and immunogenicity of the coadministration of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV), quadrivalent split-virion inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4), and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) in adults in China is unknown.
Methods
In this open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial, participants aged ≥ 18 years were recruited from the community. Individuals were eligible if they had no history of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or any pneumonia vaccine and had not received an influenza vaccine during the 2020–21 influenza season. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1), using block randomization stratified, to either: SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and IIV4 followed by SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and PPV23 (SARS-CoV-2 + IIV4/PPV23 group); two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (SARS-CoV-2 vaccine group); or IIV4 followed by PPV23 (IIV4/PPV23 group). Vaccines were administered 28 days apart, with blood samples taken on day 0 and day 28 before vaccination, and on day 56.
Results
Between March 10 and March 15, 2021, 1152 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to three groups (384 per group). 1132 participants were included in the per-protocol population (375 in the SARS-CoV-2 + IIV4/PPV23 group, 380 in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine group, and 377 in the IIV4/PPV23 group). The seroconversion rate (100 % vs 100 %) and GMT (159.13 vs 173.20; GMT ratio of 0.92 [95 % CI 0.83 to 1.02]) of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies in the SARS-CoV-2 + IIV4/PPV23 group was not inferior to those in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine group. The SARS-CoV-2 + IIV4/PPV23 group was not inferior to the IIV4/PPV23 group in terms of seroconversion rates and GMT of influenza virus antibodies for all strains except for the seroconversion rate for the B/Yamagata strain. The SARS-CoV-2 + IIV4/PPV23 group was not inferior to the IIV4/PPV23 group regarding seroconversion rates and GMC of Streptococcus pneumoniae IgG antibodies specific to all serotypes. All vaccines were well tolerated.
Conclusions
The coadministration of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and IIV4/PPV23 is safe with satisfactory immunogenicity. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04790851.

AB  - The impact of COVID-19 has been massive and unprecedented, affecting almost every aspect of our daily lives. This paper attempts to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on the future size, composition and distribution of Australia's population by projecting a range of scenarios. Drawing on the academic literature, historical data and informed by expert judgement, four scenarios representing possible future courses of economic and demographic recovery are formulated. Results suggest that Australia's population could be 6 per cent lower by 2040 in a Longer scenario than in the No Pandemic scenario, primarily due to a huge reduction in international migration. Impacts on population ageing will be less severe, leading to a one percentage point increase in the proportion of the population aged 65 and over by 2040. Differential impacts will be felt across Australian States and Territories, with the biggest absolute and relative reductions in growth occurring in the most populous states, Victoria and New South Wales. Given the ongoing nature of the crisis at the time of writing, there remains significant uncertainty surrounding the plausibility of the proposed scenarios. Ongoing monitoring of the demographic impacts of COVID-19 are important to ensure appropriate planning and recovery in the years ahead.

AB  - How might COVID-19 affect human capital and wellbeing in the long run? The COVID-19 pandemic has already imposed a heavy human cost—taken together, this public health crisis and its attendant economic downturn appear poised to dwarf the scope, scale, and disruptiveness of most modern pandemics. What evidence we do have about other modern pandemics is largely limited to short-run impacts. Consequently, recent experience can do little to help us anticipate and respond to COVID-19’s potential long-run impact on individuals over decades and even generations. History, however, offers a solution. Historical crises offer closer analogues to COVID-19 in each of its key dimensions—as a global pandemic, as a global recession—and offer the runway necessary to study the life-course and intergenerational outcomes. In this paper, we review the evidence on the long-run effects on health, labor, and human capital of both historical pandemics (with a focus on the 1918 Influenza Pandemic) and historical recessions (with a focus on the Great Depression). We conclude by discussing how past crises can inform our approach to COVID-19—helping tell us what to look for, what to prepare for, and what data we ought to collect now.

AB  - Background
The evolution of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still hard to predict, even after several months of dealing with the pandemic.
Aims
To develop and validate a score to predict outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
Methods
All consecutive adults hospitalized for COVID-19 from February to April 2020 were included in a nationwide observational study. Primary composite outcome was transfer to an intensive care unit from an emergency department or conventional ward, or in-hospital death. A score that estimates the risk of experiencing the primary outcome was constructed from a derivation cohort using stacked LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), and was tested in a validation cohort.
Results
Among 2873 patients analysed (57.9% men; 66.6±17.0 years), the primary outcome occurred in 838 (29.2%) patients: 551 (19.2%) were transferred to an intensive care unit; and 287 (10.0%) died in-hospital without transfer to an intensive care unit. Using stacked LASSO, we identified 11 variables independently associated with the primary outcome in multivariable analysis in the derivation cohort (n=2313), including demographics (sex), triage vitals (body temperature, dyspnoea, respiratory rate, fraction of inspired oxygen, blood oxygen saturation) and biological variables (pH, platelets, C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, estimated glomerular filtration rate). The Critical COVID-19 France (CCF) risk score was then developed, and displayed accurate calibration and discrimination in the derivation cohort, with C-statistics of 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.75–0.80). The CCF risk score performed significantly better (i.e. higher C-statistics) than the usual critical care risk scores.
Conclusions
The CCF risk score was built using data collected routinely at hospital admission to predict outcomes in patients with COVID-19. This score holds promise to improve early triage of patients and allocation of healthcare resources.

AB  - Summary
Migrant populations are one of several underimmunised groups in the EU or European Economic Area (EU/EEA), yet little is known about their involvement in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. This information is vital to develop targeted strategies to improve the health of diverse migrant communities. We did a systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42019157473; Jan 1, 2000, to May 22, 2020) adhering to PRISMA guidelines, to identify studies on vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks (measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, hepatitis A, varicella, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae) involving migrants residing in the EU/EEA and Switzerland. We identified 45 studies, reporting on 47 distinct vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks across 13 countries. Most reported outbreaks involving migrants were of measles (n=24; 6496 cases), followed by varicella (n=11; 505 cases), hepatitis A (n=7; 1356 cases), rubella (n=3; 487 cases), and mumps (n=2; 293 cases). 19 (40%) outbreaks, predominantly varicella and measles, were reported in temporary refugee camps or shelters. Of 11 varicella outbreaks, nine (82%) were associated with adult migrants. Half of measles outbreaks (n=11) were associated with migrants from eastern European countries. In conclusion, migrants are involved in vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks in Europe, with adult and child refugees residing in shelters or temporary camps at particular risk, alongside specific nationality groups. Vulnerability varies by disease, setting, and demographics, highlighting the importance of tailoring catch-up vaccination interventions to specific groups in order to meet regional and global vaccination targets as recommended by the new Immunisation Agenda 2030 framework for action. A better understanding of vaccine access and intent in migrant groups and a greater focus on co-designing interventions is urgently needed, with direct implications for COVID-19 vaccine delivery.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused much uncertainty and disruption in healthcare resulting in many challenges for strategic planning. Scenario planning is a tool that allows healthcare leaders to plan healthcare delivery strategies by incorporating the uncertainties into the analysis and planning process.
Materials and Methods
Variables were identified which will have major impact on the future, but whose future direction is uncertain. The extremes of these drivers were used to generate multiple scenarios. A subset of scenarios was used to evaluate potential tactics to determine which may be high yield in the face of uncertainty.
Results
Unlike traditional strategic planning, scenario planning does not develop a single future with a path to that future. Scenario planning evaluates tactics to determine which would be helpful in specific scenarios, multiple different futures or under specific conditions.
Conclusion
We present a scenario planning model which can be used to determine specific tactics to accommodate the uncertainty due to variable healthcare delivery needs in the COVID-19 era.

The lack of known vaccines and effective treatments has generated the need to use drugs with very little evidence for their incorporation into pharmacotherapeutic protocols agreed by the clinical team. The hospital pharmacist, within the multidisciplinary team, has been responsible for critically evaluating the alternatives and positioning them in these protocols. Finally, some ethical and legal questions that should be considered in this scenario are analyzed in this article.

AB  - Summary
Background
Exposure to poor air quality leads to increased premature mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Among the far-reaching implications of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial improvement in air quality was observed worldwide after the lockdowns imposed by many countries. We aimed to assess the implications of different lockdown measures on air pollution levels in Europe and China, as well as the short-term and long-term health impact.
Methods
For this modelling study, observations of fine particulate matter (PM2·5) concentrations from more than 2500 stations in Europe and China during 2016–20 were integrated with chemical transport model simulations to reconstruct PM2·5 fields at high spatiotemporal resolution. The health benefits, expressed as short-term and long-term avoided mortality from PM2·5 exposure associated with the interventions imposed to control the COVID-19 pandemic, were quantified on the basis of the latest epidemiological studies. To explore the long-term variability in air quality and associated premature mortality, we built different scenarios of economic recovery (immediate or gradual resumption of activities, a second outbreak in autumn, and permanent lockdown for the whole of 2020).
Findings
The lockdown interventions led to a reduction in population-weighted PM2·5 of 14·5 μg m−3 across China (−29·7%) and 2·2 μg m−3 across Europe (−17·1%), with unprecedented reductions of 40 μg m−3 in bimonthly mean PM2·5 in the areas most affected by COVID-19 in China. In the short term, an estimated 24 200 (95% CI 22 380–26 010) premature deaths were averted throughout China between Feb 1 and March 31, and an estimated 2190 (1960–2420) deaths were averted in Europe between Feb 21 and May 17. We also estimated a positive number of long-term avoided premature fatalities due to reduced PM2·5 concentrations, ranging from 76 400 (95% CI 62 600–86 900) to 287 000 (233 700–328 300) for China, and from 13 600 (11 900–15 300) to 29 500 (25 800–33 300) for Europe, depending on the future scenarios of economic recovery adopted.
Interpretation
These results indicate that lockdown interventions led to substantial reductions in PM2·5 concentrations in China and Europe. We estimated that tens of thousands of premature deaths from air pollution were avoided, although with significant differences observed in Europe and China. Our findings suggest that considerable improvements in air quality are achievable in both China and Europe when stringent emission control policies are adopted.

AB  - There are important questions surrounding the potential contribution of outdoor and indoor air quality in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and perpetuation of COVID-19 epidemic waves. Environmental health may be a critical component of COVID-19 prevention. The public health community and health agencies should consider the evolving evidence in their recommendations and statements, and work to issue occupational guidelines. Evidence coming from the current epidemiological and experimental research is expected to add knowledge about virus diffusion, COVID-19 severity in most polluted areas, inter-personal distance requirements and need for wearing face masks in indoor or outdoor environments. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for maintaining particulate matter concentrations at low levels for multiple health-related reasons, which may also include the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Indoor environments represent even a more crucial challenge to cope with, as it is easier for the SARS-COV2 to spread, remain vital and infect other subjects in closed spaces in the presence of already infected asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic people. The potential merits of preventive measures, such as CO2 monitoring associated with natural or controlled mechanical ventilation and air purification, for schools, indoor public places (restaurants, offices, hotels, museums, theatres/cinemas etc.) and transportations need to be carefully considered. Hospital settings and nursing/retirement homes as well as emergency rooms, infectious diseases divisions and ambulances represent higher risk indoor environments and may require additional monitoring and specific decontamination strategies based on mechanical ventilation or air purification.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a global issue of concern for public health, environment and socio-economic setup. This review addresses several aspects of epidemiology, and pathogenesis, environmental resource quality (air quality, hazardous waste management, and wastewater surveillance issues), and socio-economic issues worldwide. The accelerated research activity in the development of diagnostic kits for SARS-CoV-2 is in progress for the rapid sequencing of various strains of SARS-CoV-2. A notable reduction in air pollutants (NO2 and PM2.5) has been observed worldwide, but high air polluted cities showed intense mortalities in COVID-19 affected areas. The use of health safety equipment halted transportation, and work-from-home policy drastically impacted the quantity of solid and hazardous wastes management services. Wastewater appeared as another mode of enteric transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, wastewater-based surveillance could act as a mode of the data source to track the virus's community spread. The pandemic also had a substantial socio-economic impact (health budget, industrial manufacturing, job loss, and unemployment) and further aggravated the countries' economic burden.

AB  - Background
Vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) is a rare syndrome associated with adenoviral vector vaccines for COVID-19. The syndrome is characterized by thrombosis, anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies, thrombocytopenia, high D-dimer, and hypofibrinogenemia.
Objectives
To investigate abnormalities in fibrinolysis that contribute to the clinical features of VITT.
Methods
Plasma samples from 18 suspected VITT cases were tested for anti-PF4 by ELISA and characterized as meeting criteria for VITT (11/18) or deemed unlikely (7/18; non-VITT). Antigen levels of PAI-1, factor XIII (FXIII), plasmin-α2antiplasmin (PAP), and inflammatory markers were quantified. Plasmin generation was quantified by chromogenic substrate. Western blotting was performed with antibodies to fibrinogen, FXIII-A, and plasminogen.
Results
VITT patients 10/11 had scores indicative of overt disseminated intravascular coagulation, while 0/7 non-VITT patients met the criteria. VITT patients had significantly higher levels of inflammatory markers, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, and C-reactive protein. In VITT patients, both fibrinogen and FXIII levels were significantly lower, while PAP and tPA-mediated plasmin generation were higher compared to non-VITT patients. Evidence of fibrinogenolysis was observed in 9/11 VITT patients but not in non-VITT patients or healthy controls. Fibrinogen degradation products were apparent, with obvious cleavage of the fibrinogen α-chain. PAP complex was evident in those VITT patients with fibrinogenolysis, but not in non-VITT patients or healthy donors.
Conclusion
VITT patients show evidence of overt disseminated intravascular coagulation and fibrinogenolysis, mediated by dysregulated plasmin generation, as evidenced by increased PAP and plasmin generation. These observations are consistent with the clinical presentation of both thrombosis and bleeding in VITT.

AB  - COVID-19 is an ongoing viral pandemic disease that is caused by SARS-CoV2, inducing severe pneumonia in humans. However, several classes of repurposed drugs have been recommended, no specific vaccines or effective therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 are developed till now. Viral dependence on ACE-2, as entry receptors, drove the researchers into RAS impact on COVID-19 pathogenesis. Several evidences have pointed at Neprilysin (NEP) as one of pulmonary RAS components. Considering the protective effect of NEP against pulmonary inflammatory reactions and fibrosis, it is suggested to direct the future efforts towards its potential role in COVID-19 pathophysiology. Thus, the review aimed to shed light on the potential beneficial effects of NEP pathways as a novel target for COVID-19 therapy by summarizing its possible molecular mechanisms. Additional experimental and clinical studies explaining more the relationships between NEP and COVID-19 will greatly benefit in designing the future treatment approaches.

AB  - Patients admitted to the ICU with critical COVID-19 often require prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation. Difficulty weaning, lack of progress, and clinical deterioration are commonly encountered. These conditions should prompt a thorough evaluation for persistent or untreated manifestations of COVID-19, as well as complications from COVID-19 and its various treatments. Inflammation may persist and lead to fibroproliferative changes in the lungs. Infectious complications may arise including bacterial superinfection in the earlier stages of disease. Use of immunosuppressants may lead to the dissemination of latent infections, and to opportunistic infections. Venous thromboembolic disease is common, as are certain neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 including delirium and stroke. High levels of ventilatory support may lead to ventilator-induced injury to the lungs and diaphragm. We present diagnostic and therapeutic considerations for the mechanically ventilated patient with COVID-19 who shows persistent or worsening signs of critical illness, and we offer an approach to treating this complex but common scenario.

AB  - Currently, the world is facing a Coronavirus pandemic with a grave deficiency of specific therapy for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). Moreover, scientists attempt to discover the most refined approach to prevent this condition. Regarding COVID-19 infection, herbal medicines with immunomodulatory effects may offer patients a promising preventive treatment option. Several ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are effective during this worrisome Coronavirus pandemic i.e. Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers, Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal, Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Curcuma longa L. etc. TCM was shown to be utilized with over 90% efficacy when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in early 2020. In addition to herbal treatments and nutraceutical drugs, dietary supplements such as vitamins and amino acid derivatives also play a significant part in COVID-19 management. Diet can assist in regulating inflammation, while nutraceuticals can aid in the prevention of viral invasion. Functional amino acids (e.g., arginine, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, taurine, and tryptophan) and glutathione, which are all abundant in animal-sourced foodstuffs, are crucial for optimum immunity and health in humans and animals. The goal of this article is to thoroughly evaluate recent statistics on the effectiveness of herbal medicines in COVID-19, the antiviral activity of nutraceuticals, and the significance of these results in creating dietary supplements that would enhance innate immunity and contribute as preventive measures against severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

We find heterogeneous patterns in herding across the ten countries during the pandemic, but overall, there is limited evidence of herding during this period, with only Italy, Sweden, and the United States displaying signs of herding. A cross-sectional analysis reveals that herding measures during the pandemic are negatively associated with stricter governmental actions that restrict mobility, and positively associated with economic support measures.

AB  - The clinical trial landscape for Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is radically different from that of previous epidemics. Compared with H1N1, Ebola, and Zika, COVID-19 had an order of magnitude more clinical trials within the first 3 months following the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). These trials have started much faster, are more geographically diverse, and are less likely to be funded by industry. However, the almost simultaneous design and initiation of hundreds of trials with 0.3 million participants across 78 countries creates the potential for congestion and inefficiencies and enhances risks for investors. Thus, an international coordination mechanism for clinical trials could be valuable in this and other situations.

AB  - Vulnerable populations such as the uninsured, unemployed, and unhoused face significant morbidity and mortality from influenza but are less likely to receive the annual vaccine and have limited access to medical care. We describe an interprofessional, student-run vaccine outreach program (VOP) in Davidson County, Tennessee that lowers barriers to vaccination through free vaccination events in nontraditional community locations. We provide this framework as a model to expand novel, seasonal, or outbreak-oriented vaccine outreach to resource-poor populations. Demographic data were collected from the patients who received an influenza vaccine between 2015 and 2019 through an optional survey to determine whether these events were reaching unhoused, uninsured, and/or unemployed individuals. Of 1,803 patients, 1,733 (96.1%) completed at least one field of the demographic form. Overall, 481 (27.8%) were individuals without homes or living in temporary housing and 673 (38.8%) were unemployed. Most patients, 1,109 (64.0%), did not have health insurance at any point during the prior two years. With the addition of a nurse practitioner student to VOP leadership, the 2018–2019 VOP reached the most unhoused or temporarily-housed (228, 32.3%), unemployed (313, 18.5%), and disabled (60, 8.5%) patients. The VOP can be adapted to meet community needs, funding, and volunteer interest. The VOP model may be applicable to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, especially since the economic impact of COVID-19 has increased unemployment rates and housing instability. Healthcare students serve as an eager, underutilized resource who can be leveraged to disseminate vaccines to individuals with limited access to care.

AB  - COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, emerged as the deadliest outbreak that has now become a serious health issue to mankind. Activation of inflammatory signaling pathways and cytokine storm are crucial factors that lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. Excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines leads to the dysregulation of the innate immune system. The cytokine storm attracts many inflammatory cells that infiltrate into the lung tissues and ultimately cause immune damage. In addition to the dysregulation of the immune system, dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) due to the downregulation of ACE2 is also associated with the mortality of COVID-19 patients. Both the mechanisms are directly or indirectly associated with cytokine storm that promotes vascular hyperpermeability, vascular edema leading to hypercoagulation and hence multiorgan damage. As of now, there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19, but scientists have purposed several treatment options including cytokine inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, immunomodulators, plasma therapy, etc. In this article, we have provided the detailed mechanism of occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory storm and its connection with the pre-existing inflammatory conditions. Possible treatment options to cope up with the severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are also discussed.

AB  - Objective
We compared outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19 versus non–COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) managed using a dynamic, goal-driven approach to venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
Methods
We performed a retrospective, single-center analysis of our institutional ECMO registry using data from 2017 to 2021. We used Kaplan–Meier plots, Cox proportional hazard models, and propensity score analyses to evaluate the association of COVID-19 status (COVID-19-related ARDS vs non–COVID-19 ARDS) and survival to decannulation, discharge, tracheostomy, and extubation. We also conducted subgroup analyses to compare outcomes with the use of extracorporeal cytoreductive techniques (CytoSorb [CytoSorbents Corp] and plasmapheresis).
Results
The sample comprised 128 patients, 50 with COVID-19 and 78 with non–COVID-19 ARDS. Advancing age was associated with decreased probability of survival to decannulation (P = .04). Compared with the non–COVID-19 ARDS group, patients with COVID-19 had a greater probability of survival to extubation (P < .01) and comparable survival to discharge (P = .14).
Conclusions
Patients with COVID-19 managed with ECMO had comparable outcomes as patients with non-COVID ARDS. A strategy of early extubation and ambulation might be a safe and effective strategy to improve outcomes and survival, even for patients with severe COVID-19.

AB  - With the increasing prevalence of obesity, there is a growing awareness of its impact on infectious diseases. In past epidemics of influenza A and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, obesity has been identified as a risk factor influencing the severity of illness in infected persons. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a large number of deaths and health damages worldwide. Increasing numbers of reports have linked obesity to more severe COVID-19 disease and death. This review focuses on the impact of obesity on patients with COVID-19. We comprehensively analyzed the various mechanisms of obesity affecting the severity of the disease. In addition, on the basis of the vulnerability of people with obesity during the COVID-19 epidemic, we summarized both individual-level and hospital-level prevention and management measures for COVID-19 patients with obesity and discussed the impact of isolation on people with obesity.

To deal with the severe crisis resulting from the pandemic, worldwide institutions have been forced to make decisions that profoundly affect the socio-economic realm. In this sense, researchers from diverse knowledge areas are investigating the behavior of the disease in a rush against time. In both cases, the lack of reliable data has been an obstacle to carry out such tasks with accuracy. To tackle this challenge, COnVIDa (https://convida.inf.um.es) has been designed and developed as a user-friendly tool that easily gathers rigorous multidisciplinary data related to the COVID-19 pandemic from different data sources. In particular, the pandemic expansion is analyzed with variables of health nature, but also social ones, mobility, etc. Besides, COnVIDa permits to smoothly join such data, compare and download them for further analysis. Due to the open-science nature of the project, COnVIDa is easily extensible to any other region of the planet. In this way, COnVIDa becomes a data facilitator for decision-making processes, as well as a catalyst for new scientific researches related to this pandemic.

AB  - Background
Patients with COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 exhibit diverse clinical manifestations and severity including enteric involvement. Commensal gut bacteria can contribute to defense against potential pathogens by promoting beneficial immune interactions. Interventions targeting the gut microbiome may have systemic anti-viral effects in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Scope and approach
To summarise alterations of gut microbiota in patients with COVID-19 including impact of specific bacteria on disease severity, discuss current knowledge on the role of probiotics, prebiotics and dietary approaches including vitamin D in preventing and reducing disease susceptibility and review clinical studies using probiotics to target coronavirus. A literature review on SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, gut microbiome and immunity was undertaken and relevant literature was summarised and critically examined.
Key findings and conclusions
Integrity of gut microbiome was perturbed in SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated with disease severity. Poor prognosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed in subjects with underlying co-morbidities who had increased gut permeability and reduced gut microbiome diversity. Dietary microbes, including probiotics or selected prebiotics of Chinese origin, had anti-viral effects against other forms of coronavirus, and could positively impact host immune functions during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous studies are investigating the role of probiotics in preventing and reducing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers, household contacts and affected patients. An approach to strengthen intestinal barrier and lower pro-inflammatory states by adopting a more diversified diet during COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with immune dysfunction and gut microbiota alterations. Delineating mechanisms of probiotics, prebiotics and diet with anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity present opportunities for discovery of microbial therapeutics to prevent and treat COVID-19.

AB  - As of 25th July, 2022, global Disease burden of 575,430,244 confirmed cases and over 6,403,511 deaths have been attributed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Co-infections/secondary infections continue to plague patients around the world as result of the co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus, biochemical changes caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) especially significant elevation in free iron levels, immune suppression caused by SARS-CoV-2, and indiscriminate use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of severe COVID-19 disease. In such circumstances, opportunistic fungal infections pose significant challenge for COVID-19 disease therapy in patients with other co-morbidities. Although COVID-19-associated Mucormycosis (CAM) has been widely recognized, currently extensive research is being conducted on mucormycosis. It has been widely agreed that patients undergoing corticosteroid therapy are highly susceptible for CAM, henceforth high index of screening and intensive care and management is need of an hour in order to have favorable outcomes in these patients. Diagnosis in such cases is often delayed and eventually the disease progresses quickly which poses added burden to clinician and increases patient load in critical care units of hospitals. A vast perusal of literature indicated that patients with diabetes mellitus and those with other co-morbidities might be highly vulnerable to develop mucormycosis. In the present work, the case series of three patients presented at Chest Disease Hospital Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir infected with CAM has been described with their epidemiological data in supplementary section. All these cases were found to be affected with co-morbidity of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and were under corticosteroid therapy. Furthermore, given the significant death rate linked with mucormycosis and the growing understanding of the diseases significance, systematic review of the literature on CAM has been discussed and we have attempted to discuss emerging CAM and related aspects of the disease.

AB  - A novel coronavirus termed as COVID-19 by WHO has been the causative agent of an unprecedented pandemic in the history of humanity. The global burden of mortality and morbidity associated with this pandemic continues to increase with each passing day as it is progressively leading to multiorgan dysfunction. In most cases, the cause of death has been attributed to respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiac failure, kidney injury, or coagulopathy. As more knowledge is being unfolded, an in-depth understanding of various systemic manifestations and complications of SARS-CoV2 is vital for optimum management of these patients. This novel virus is known to spread faster than its two ancestors, the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), demonstrating a case fatality ranging from 5 to 8% [1]. Hematological abnormalities such as lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated D-Dimer, elevated fibrinogen, elevated fibrinogen degradation products as well as cytokines such as IL-6 are emerging as important prognostic marker for worse outcome of COVID-19. Among various systemic manifestations, hematological complications such as venous thrombosis causing pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, and arterial thrombosis causing myocardial infarction, strokes or limb ischemia are being noted to be directly linked to high mortality from COVID-19. An attempt to understand the pathophysiology of various hematological abnormalities including cytokine storm, hypercoagulable state and some rare presentations of this disease hence becomes imperative. Through this review, we aim to provide an up-to-date summary of current evidence-based literature of hematological manifestations, their consequences and management including role of anticoagulation and drugs targeting cytokine storm in patients with SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Summary
Background
Before 2020, mental disorders were leading causes of the global health-related burden, with depressive and anxiety disorders being leading contributors to this burden. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has created an environment where many determinants of poor mental health are exacerbated. The need for up-to-date information on the mental health impacts of COVID-19 in a way that informs health system responses is imperative. In this study, we aimed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence and burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders globally in 2020.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review of data reporting the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic and published between Jan 1, 2020, and Jan 29, 2021. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, preprint servers, grey literature sources, and consulted experts. Eligible studies reported prevalence of depressive or anxiety disorders that were representative of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic and had a pre-pandemic baseline. We used the assembled data in a meta-regression to estimate change in the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders between pre-pandemic and mid-pandemic (using periods as defined by each study) via COVID-19 impact indicators (human mobility, daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, and daily excess mortality rate). We then used this model to estimate the change from pre-pandemic prevalence (estimated using Disease Modelling Meta-Regression version 2.1 [known as DisMod-MR 2.1]) by age, sex, and location. We used final prevalence estimates and disability weights to estimate years lived with disability and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders.
Findings
We identified 5683 unique data sources, of which 48 met inclusion criteria (46 studies met criteria for major depressive disorder and 27 for anxiety disorders). Two COVID-19 impact indicators, specifically daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and reductions in human mobility, were associated with increased prevalence of major depressive disorder (regression coefficient [B] 0·9 [95% uncertainty interval 0·1 to 1·8; p=0·029] for human mobility, 18·1 [7·9 to 28·3; p=0·0005] for daily SARS-CoV-2 infection) and anxiety disorders (0·9 [0·1 to 1·7; p=0·022] and 13·8 [10·7 to 17·0; p<0·0001]. Females were affected more by the pandemic than males (B 0·1 [0·1 to 0·2; p=0·0001] for major depressive disorder, 0·1 [0·1 to 0·2; p=0·0001] for anxiety disorders) and younger age groups were more affected than older age groups (−0·007 [–0·009 to −0·006; p=0·0001] for major depressive disorder, −0·003 [–0·005 to −0·002; p=0·0001] for anxiety disorders). We estimated that the locations hit hardest by the pandemic in 2020, as measured with decreased human mobility and daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, had the greatest increases in prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. We estimated an additional 53·2 million (44·8 to 62·9) cases of major depressive disorder globally (an increase of 27·6% [25·1 to 30·3]) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such that the total prevalence was 3152·9 cases (2722·5 to 3654·5) per 100 000 population. We also estimated an additional 76·2 million (64·3 to 90·6) cases of anxiety disorders globally (an increase of 25·6% [23·2 to 28·0]), such that the total prevalence was 4802·4 cases (4108·2 to 5588·6) per 100 000 population. Altogether, major depressive disorder caused 49·4 million (33·6 to 68·7) DALYs and anxiety disorders caused 44·5 million (30·2 to 62·5) DALYs globally in 2020.
Interpretation
This pandemic has created an increased urgency to strengthen mental health systems in most countries. Mitigation strategies could incorporate ways to promote mental wellbeing and target determinants of poor mental health and interventions to treat those with a mental disorder. Taking no action to address the burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders should not be an option.

AB  - Family caregivers in Canadian long-term care homes are estimated to provide 10 h per week of direct care to approximately 30% of residents through roles including mobility support, mealtime assistance, personal care, social interaction, psychological care, care coordination, and advocacy. Despite these contributions, they continue to be viewed as visitors rather than as key participants in the interdependent relationships that support the long-term care sector. Their marginalization was evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, as Canadian public health policy focused on preventing them from entering long-term care, rather than supporting personal risk management, symptom screening, personal protective equipment, and other mechanisms for safe involvement in care. Several iatrogenic resident outcomes have been attributed to this, including decreased cognitive function, decreased mobility, increased incontinence, weight loss, increased depression and anxiety, increased responsive behaviours amongst those living with dementia, and increased delirium. In this commentary article, we argue that family caregiver presence was conflated as a risk when instead, it contributed to unintended harm. We identify nine well-known human social cognitive predispositions that may have contributed to this. We then examine their implications for trust in long-term care, and consider how quality and safety can be further fostered in long-term care by working in partnership with family caregivers to rebuild trust through enquiry and collaboration. We advocate incorporating trust as an essential measure of quality health service.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 is considered the most critical health pandemic of 21st century. Due to extremely high transmission rate, people are more susceptible to viral infection. COVID-19 patients having chronic type-2 asthma prevails a major risk as it may aggravate the disease and morbidities.
Objective
The present review mainly focuses on correlating the influence of COVID-19 in type-2 asthmatic patients. Besides, it delineates the treatment measures and drugs that can be used to manage mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of COVID-19 in asthmatic patients, thus preventing any exacerbation.
Methods
An in-depth research was carried out from different peer-reviewed articles till September 2020 from several renowned databases like PubMed, Frontier, MEDLINE, and related websites like WHO, CDC, MOHFW, and the information was analysed and written in a simplified manner.
Results
The progressive results were quite conflicting as severe cases of COVID-19 shows an increase in the level of several cytokines that can augment inflammation to the bronchial tracts, worsening the asthma attacks. Contradicting to this, certain findings reveal the decrease in the severity of COVID-19 due to the elevation of T-cells in type-2 asthmatic patients, as prominent reduction of T-cell is seen in most of the COVID-19 positive patients. This helps to counteract the balance of immune responses and hence ameliorate the disease progression.
Conclusion
Asthmatic patients must remain cautious during the COVID-19 pandemic by maintaining all the precautions to stay safe due to limited research data. Future strategies should include a better understanding of asthmatic exacerbation and its relation to COVID-19.

AB  - The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 stimulates significant efforts and approaches to understand its global spread. Although the recent introduction of the vaccine is a crucial prophylactic step, the effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is still undiscovered. An in-depth analysis of symptoms and clinical parameters, as well as molecular changes, is necessary to comprehend COVID-19 and propose a remedy for affected people to fight that disease. The analysis of available clinical data and SARS-CoV-2 infection markers underlined the main pathogenic process in COVID-19 is cytokine storm and inflammation. That led us to suggest that the most important pathogenic feature of SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 is oxidative stress and cellular damage stimulated by iron, a source of Fenton reaction and its product hydroxyl radical (•OH), the most reactive ROS with t1/2–10−9s. Therefore we suggest some scavenging agents are a reasonable choice for overcoming its toxic effect and can be regarded as a treatment for the disease on the molecular level.

AB  - The Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine was developed over a century ago and has become one of the most used vaccines without undergoing a modern vaccine development life cycle. Despite this, the vaccine has protected many millions from severe and disseminated forms of tuberculosis (TB). In addition, BCG has cross-mycobacterial effects against non-tuberculous mycobacteria and off-target (also called non-specific or heterologous) effects against other infections and diseases. More recently, BCG’s effects on innate immunity suggest it might improve the immune response against viral respiratory infections including SARS-CoV-2. New TB vaccines, developed over the last 30 years, show promise, particularly in prevention of progression to disease from TB infection in young adults. The role of BCG in the context of new TB vaccines remains uncertain as most participants included in trials have been previously BCG immunised. BCG replacement vaccines are in efficacy trials and these may also have off-target effects.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to infect hundred thousands of people every day worldwide. Since it is a novel virus, research continues to update the possible therapeutic targets when new evidence regarding COVID-19 are gathered. This article presents an evidence-based hypothesis that activating the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway is a potential target for COVID-19. Interferons (IFNs) have broad-spectrum antiviral activity including against SARS-CoV-2. Induction of HO-1 and increase in the heme catabolism end-product confer antiviral activity. IFN activation results in inhibition of viral replication in various viral infections. COVID-19 induced inflammation as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and coagulopathies are now known major causes of mortality. A protective role of HO-1 induction in inflammation, inflammation-induced coagulation, and ARDS has been reported. Based on an association of HO-1 promoter polymorphisms and disease severity, we propose an evaluation of the status of these polymorphisms in COVID-19 patients who become severely ill. If an association is established, it might be helpful in identifying patients at high risk. Hence, we hypothesize that HO-1 pathway activation could be a therapeutic strategy against COVID-19 and associated complications.

AB  - The U.S. tourism and hospitality workforce is disproportionately represented by immigrants and minorities, particularly in low-wage jobs with adverse work conditions. Immigrant hotel and foodservice workers face excess chronic stress and related syndemic risks, exacerbated by social, political, and economic inequities. COVID-19 has suddenly intensified the stressful and already difficult circumstances of immigrant service sector workers. The travel and tourism sector is one of the hardest hit due to widespread travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders designed to curb infection spread. Restrictions and lockdowns have devastated tourism-dependent destinations and displaced millions of vulnerable workers, causing them to lose their livelihoods. Compared to the general workforce, a sizeable increase in occupational stress has already been observed in the hospitality/tourism sector over the past 15–20 years. COVID-19 and related fears add further strains on immigrant hotel and foodservice workers, potentially exerting a significant toll on mental and physical health and safety.

AB  - Objectives
Data on the economic burden of long COVID are scarce. We aimed to examine the prevalence and medical costs of treating long COVID.
Methods
We conducted this historical cohort study using data from patients with COVID-19 among members of a large health provider in Israel. Cases were defined according to physician diagnosis (definite long COVID) or suggestive symptoms given ≥ 4 weeks from infection (probable cases). Healthcare resource utilization and direct healthcare costs (HCCs) in the period before infection and afterward were compared across study groups.
Results
Between March 2020, and March 2021, a total of 180,759 COVID-19 patients (mean [SD] age = 32.9 years [19.0 years]; 89,665 [49.6%] females) were identified. Overall, 14,088 (7.8%) individuals developed long COVID (mean [SD] age = 40.0 years [19.0 years]; 52.4% females). Among them, 1477(10.5%) were definite long COVID and 12,611(89.5%) were defined as probable long COVID. Long COVID was associated with age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.058 per year, 95% CI: 1.053-1.063), female sex (AOR = 1.138; 95% CI: 1.098-1.180), smoking (AOR = 1.532; 95% CI: 1.358-1.727), and symptomatic acute phase (AOR = 1.178; 95% CI: 1.133-1.224), primarily muscle pain and cough. Hypertension was an important risk factor for long COVID among younger adults. Compared with patients with non-long COVID, definite and probable cases were associated with AORs of 2.47 (2.22-2.75) and 1.76 (1.68-1.84) for post-COVID hospitalization, respectively. Although among patients with non-long COVID HCCs decreased from $1400 during 4 months before the infection to $1021 and among patients with long COVID, HCCs increased from $2435 to $2810.
Conclusion
Long COVID is associated with a substantial increase in the utilization of healthcare services and direct medical costs. Our findings underline the need for timely planning and allocating resources for patient-centered care for patients with long COVID as well as for its secondary prevention in high-risk patients.

AB  - Summary
Background
Concomitant seasonal influenza vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine booster could help to minimise potential disruption to the seasonal influenza vaccination campaign and maximise protection against both diseases among individuals at risk of severe disease and hospitalisation. This study aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of concomitant administration of high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV-HD) and a mRNA-1273 vaccine booster dose in older adults.
Methods
This study is an ongoing, phase 2, multicentre, open-label, descriptive trial at six clinical research sites in the USA. We describe the interim results up to 21 days after vaccination (July–August, 2021). Community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older, who were previously vaccinated with a two-dose primary schedule of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, were eligible for inclusion. The second dose of the primary mRNA-1273 vaccination series was required to have been received at least 5 months before enrolment in the study. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using a permuted block method stratified by site and by age group (<75 years vs ≥75 years), to receive concomitant administration of QIV-HD and mRNA-1273 vaccine, QIV-HD alone, or mRNA-1273 vaccine alone. Randomisation lists, generated by Sanofi Pasteur biostatistics platform, were provided to study investigators for study group allocation. Unsolicited adverse events occurring immediately, solicited local and systemic reactions up to day 8, and unsolicited adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and medically attended adverse events up to day 22 were reported. Haemagglutination inhibition antibody responses to influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria strains and SARS CoV-2 binding antibody responses (SARS-CoV-2 pre-spike IgG ELISA) were assessed at day 1 and day 22. All analyses were descriptive. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04969276.
Findings
Between July 16 and Aug 31, 2021, 306 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned, of whom 296 received at least one vaccine dose (100 in the coadministration group, 92 in the QIV-HD, and 104 in the mRNA-1273 group). Reactogenicity profiles were similar between the coadministration and mRNA-1273 groups, with lower reactogenicity rates in the QIV-HD group (frequency of solicited injection site reactions 86·0% [95% CI 77·6–92·1], 91·3% [84·2–96·0], and 61·8% [50·9–71·9]; frequency of solicited systemic reactions 80·0%, [70·8–87·3], 83·7% [75·1–90·2], and 49·4% [38·7–60·2], respectively). Up to day 22, unsolicited adverse events were reported for 17·0% (95% CI 10·2–25·8) of participants in the coadministration group and 14·4% (8·3–22·7) of participants in the mRNA-1273 group, and tended to be reported at a slightly lower rate (10·9% [5·3–19·1]) in participants in the QIV-HD group. Seven participants each reported one medically attended adverse event (three in the coadministration group, one in the QIV-HD group, and three in the mRNA-1273 group). There were no serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, or deaths. Haemagglutination inhibition antibody geometric mean titres increased from day 1 to day 22 to similar levels in the coadministration and QIV-HD groups, for each influenza strain (A/H1N1: 363 [95% CI 276–476] vs 366 [272–491]; A/H3N2: 286 [233–352] vs 315 [257–386]; B/Yamagata: 429 [350–525] vs 471 [378–588]; B/Victoria: 377 [325–438] vs 390 [327–465] for the coadministration and QIV-HD groups, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 binding antibody geometric mean concentrations also increased to similar levels in the coadministration and mRNA-1273 groups at day 22 (7634 [95% CI 6445–9042] and 7904 [6883–9077], respectively).
Interpretation
No safety concerns or immune interference were observed for concomitant administration of QIV-HD with mRNA-1273 booster in adults aged 65 years and older, supporting co-administration recommendations.

AB  - Background
The impact of a postoperative diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA) remains unknown. The objective of this study is to characterize the effect of COVID-19 infection following TJA on perioperative complication rates.
Methods
The Mariner database was queried for patients undergoing total hip and total knee arthroplasty from January 2018 to April 2020. TJA patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 within 90 days postoperatively were matched in a 1:3 fashion based on age, gender, iron deficiency anemia, payer status, and Charlson Comorbidity Index with patients who were not diagnosed with COVID-19. Preoperative comorbidity profiles and complications within 3 months of surgery were compared. Statistical analysis included chi-squared tests and multivariate logistic regression with outcomes considered significant at P < .05.
Results
Of the 239 COVID-19 positive patients, 132 (55.2%) underwent total hip arthroplasty. On multivariate analysis, COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with increased odds of deep vein thrombosis (odds ratio [OR] 4.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.10-11.81, P < .001), pulmonary embolism (OR 6.27, 95% CI 2.57-16.71, P < .001), and all complications (OR 3.36, 95% CI 2.47-4.59, P < .001). Incidence of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism was greater the closer in time the COVID-19 diagnosis was to the surgical procedure (10.24 times at 1 month, 7.87 times at 2 months, and 1.42 times at 3 months; P < .001). A similar relationship was observed with all complications.
Conclusion
Postoperative COVID-19 infection is associated with higher rates of cardiopulmonary complications, thromboembolic disease, renal injury, and urinary tract infections in patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty. COVID-19 infection earlier in the postoperative period is associated with a higher risk of complications.

AB  - Background
Many nutrients have powerful immunomodulatory actions with the potential to alter susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, progression to symptoms, likelihood of severe disease, and survival.
Objective
The aim was to review the latest evidence on how malnutrition across all its forms (under- and overnutrition and micronutrient status) may influence both susceptibility to, and progression of, COVID-19.
Methods
We synthesized information on 13 nutrition-related components and their potential interactions with COVID-19: overweight, obesity, and diabetes; protein-energy malnutrition; anemia; vitamins A, C, D, and E; PUFAs; iron; selenium; zinc; antioxidants; and nutritional support. For each section we provide: 1) a landscape review of pertinent material; 2) a systematic search of the literature in PubMed and EMBASE databases, including a wide range of preprint servers; and 3) a screen of 6 clinical trial registries. All original research was considered, without restriction to study design, and included if it covered: 1) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), or SARS-CoV viruses and 2) disease susceptibility or 3) disease progression, and 4) the nutritional component of interest. Searches took place between 16 May and 11 August 2020.
Results
Across the 13 searches, 2732 articles from PubMed and EMBASE, 4164 articles from the preprint servers, and 433 trials were returned. In the final narrative synthesis, we include 22 published articles, 38 preprint articles, and 79 trials.
Conclusions
Currently there is limited evidence that high-dose supplements of micronutrients will either prevent severe disease or speed up recovery. However, results of clinical trials are eagerly awaited. Given the known impacts of all forms of malnutrition on the immune system, public health strategies to reduce micronutrient deficiencies and undernutrition remain of critical importance. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes will reduce the risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes. This review is registered at PROSPERO as CRD42020186194.

We summarized the reports of simultaneous familial KD cases to better understand the etiopathogenesis of both KD and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) related to COVID-19. Here we discuss the etiology of these syndromes from the point of view of infection and genetic susceptibility.

AB  - COVID-19 spreads via aerosols, droplets, fomites and faeces. The built environment that facilitates crowding increases exposure and hence transmission of COVID-19 as evidenced by outbreaks in both cool-dry and hot-humid climates, such as in the US prison system and dormitories in Singapore, respectively. This paper explores how the built environment influences crowding and COVID-19 transmission, focusing on informal urban settlements (slums). We propose policy and practice changes that could reduce COVID-19 transmission. There are several issues on how COVID-19 affects informal urban settlements. Slum populations tend to be younger than the overall population. Lower numbers of older people lessen the morbidity and mortality of the pandemic in slum areas. Second, many slum populations are highly mobile. By returning to their ancestral villages residents can avoid the risks of overcrowding and reduce the population density in a given area but may spread COVID-19 to other areas. Third, detection and registration of COVID-19 cases depends on patients presenting to health care providers. If the risk of visiting a health care centre outweighs the potential benefits patients may prefer not to seek treatment. The control and prevention of COVID-19 in informal urban settlements starts with organizing community infrastructure for diagnosis and treatment and assuring that basic needs (food, water, sanitation, health care and public transport) are met during quarantine. Next, community members at highest risk need to be identified and protected. Low-income, informal settlements need to be recognized as a reservoir and source for persistent transmission. Solutions to overcrowding must be developed for this and future pandemics. In view of the constant risk that slums present to the entire population decisive steps need to be taken to rehabilitate and improve informal settlements, while avoiding stigmatization.

AB  - The outbreak of SARS-COV-2 has led to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 and caused over 4.5 million deaths worldwide by September 2021. Besides the public health crisis, COVID-19 affectedthe globaleconomy and development significantly. It also led to changes in people’s mobility and lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to short-term changes, the drastic transformation of the world may account for the potentially disruptive long-term impacts. Recognizing the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial in mitigating the negative behavioral changes that directly relate to people’s psychological and social well-being. It is important to stress that citizens and governments face an uncertain situation since nobody knows exactly how the viruses and cures will develop. Better understanding of uncertainties and evaluating behavioral changes contribute to addressing the future of urban development, public transportation, and behavioral strategies to tackle COVID-19 negative consequences. The major sources of impacts on short-term (route, departure time, mode, teleshopping, and teleworking) and medium and long-term (car ownership, work location, choice of job, and residential location) mobility decisions are mostly reviewed and discussed in this paper.

AB  - Background
The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has disrupted the delivery of safe surgical care worldwide. One specific aspect of global surgical care that has been severely limited is the ability for physicians and trainees to participate in global surgical outreach programs in low- and middle-income countries.
Methods
A narrative review of the literature regarding global surgical outreach programs during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic was performed. Factors that must be considered in the reinstatement of global surgical outreach programs were identified, and suggestions to address them were provided based on the available literature and the experiences of the senior authors.
Results
As global surgical outreach programs were canceled at the start of the pandemic, many academic surgeons turned to digital solutions to continue to engage with low- and middle-income country partners. With the advent of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines and improved access to testing and treatment worldwide, the recommencement of global surgical outreach programs may begin to be considered. Important considerations before initiation include vaccine and testing availability for visiting providers, local staff, and patients, local hospital capacity, staff and equipment shortages, and the characteristics of the patient population and visiting providers. Region- and country-specific factors, including local infection rates and concomitant health crises, must also be taken into account. Expansion of digital collaborative efforts may further deepen international connections and promote sustainable models of care.
Conclusion
With careful consideration, global surgical outreach programs may begin to be safely restarted in the near future. The current article evaluates individual factors that must be considered to safely restart global surgical outreach programs as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is better controlled.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 causes coronavirus disease 2019, a pandemic which was originated from Wuhan city of China. The pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a cytokine storm in the blood (cytokinemia) and tissues, especially the lungs. One of the major repercussions of this inflammatory process is the endothelial injury-causing intestinal bleeding, coagulopathy, and thromboembolism which result in various sudden and unexpected post-COVID complications including kidney failure, myocardial infarction, or multiorgan failure. In this review, we have summarized the immune responses, biochemical changes, and inflammatory responses in the human body after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The increased amount of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and involvement of complement proteins in inflammatory reaction increase the risk of occurrence of disease.

AB  - Propolis, a resinous material produced by honey bees from plant exudates, has long been used in traditional herbal medicine and is widely consumed as a health aid and immune system booster. The COVID-19 pandemic has renewed interest in propolis products worldwide; fortunately, various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism are potential targets for propolis compounds. SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is characterized by viral spike protein interaction with cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serine protease TMPRSS2. This mechanism involves PAK1 overexpression, which is a kinase that mediates coronavirus-induced lung inflammation, fibrosis, and immune system suppression. Propolis components have inhibitory effects on the ACE2, TMPRSS2 and PAK1 signaling pathways; in addition, antiviral activity has been proven in vitro and in vivo. In pre-clinical studies, propolis promoted immunoregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including reduction in IL-6, IL-1 beta and TNF-α. This immunoregulation involves monocytes and macrophages, as well as Jak2/STAT3, NF-kB, and inflammasome pathways, reducing the risk of cytokine storm syndrome, a major mortality factor in advanced COVID-19 disease. Propolis has also shown promise as an aid in the treatment of various of the comorbidities that are particularly dangerous in COVID-19 patients, including respiratory diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. Standardized propolis products with consistent bioactive properties are now available. Given the current emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and limited therapeutic options, propolis is presented as a promising and relevant therapeutic option that is safe, easy to administrate orally and is readily available as a natural supplement and functional food.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 reached Latin-American countries slightly later than European countries, around February/March, allowing some emergency preparedness response in countries characterized by low health system capacities and socioeconomic disparities.
Objective
This paper focuses on the first months of the pandemic in five Latin American countries: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. It analyses how the pre-pandemic context, and the government's responses to contain and mitigate the spread together with economic measures have affected the COVID-19 health outcomes.
Methods
Extensive qualitative document analysis was conducted focused on publicly-available epidemiological data and federal and state/regional policy documents since the beginning of the pandemic.
Results
The countries were quick to implement stringent COVID-19 measures and incrementally scaled up their health systems capacity, although tracing and tracking have been poor. All five countries have experienced a large number of cases and deaths due to COVID-19. The analysis on the excess deaths also shows that the impact in deaths is far higher than the official numbers reported to date for some countries.
Conclusion
Despite the introduction of stringent measures of containment and mitigation, and the scale up of health system capacities, pre-pandemic conditions that characterize these countries (high informal employment, and social inequalities) have undermined the effectiveness of the countries’ responses to the pandemic. The economic support measures put in place were found to be too timid for some countries and introduced too late in most of them. Additionally, the lack of a comprehensive strategy for testing and tracking has also contributed to the failure to contain the spread of the virus.

AB  - Summary
Background
In line with movement restrictions and physical distancing essential for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO recommended postponement of all neglected tropical disease (NTD) control activities that involve community-based surveys, active case finding, and mass drug administration in April, 2020. Following revised guidance later in 2020, and after interruptions to NTD programmes of varying lengths, NTD programmes gradually restarted in the context of an ongoing pandemic. However, ongoing challenges and service gaps have been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the potential effect of the programmatic interruptions and strategies to mitigate this effect.
Methods
For seven NTDs, namely soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, trachoma, visceral leishmaniasis, and human African trypanosomiasis, we used mathematical transmission models to simulate the effect of programme interruptions on the dynamics of each of these diseases in different endemic settings. We also explored the potential benefit of implementing mitigation strategies, primarily in terms of minimising the delays to control targets.
Findings
We show that the effect of the COVID-19-induced interruption in terms of delay to achieving elimination goals might in some cases be much longer than the duration of the interruption. For schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, trachoma, and visceral leishmaniasis, a mean delay of 2–3 years for a 1-year interruption is predicted in areas of highest prevalence. We also show that these delays can largely be mitigated by measures such as additional mass drug administration or enhanced case-finding.
Interpretation
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought infectious disease control to the forefront of global consciousness. It is essential that the NTDs, so long neglected in terms of research and financial support, are not overlooked, and remain a priority in health service planning and funding.

No proven effective therapies currently exist for this virus, and efforts to develop antiviral strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 are underway. The rapidly increasing understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a notable number of possible immunological procedures and drug targets. However, gaps remain in our understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In this review, we describe the latest information in the context of immunological approaches and emerging current antiviral strategies for COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - Former studies have revealed intersex variability in immune response to infectious diseases, including Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological surveillance of the ongoing pandemic has demonstrated a male vulnerability to morbidity and mortality, despite similar infection rates between the two sexes. Divergence in the frequency of comorbidities between males and females, differences in hormonal profile, chromosomal composition and gender behavior have all been proposed as potential causative factors. Data deriving from the immunization process indirectly support the existence of a sex-specific response to SARS-CoV-2, since females apparently produce higher numbers of antibodies while simultaneously exhibiting higher rates of side effects, indicating a stronger immune reactivity to the vaccine's elements. Interpreting intersex differences in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 could lead to a deeper understanding of the COVID-19 pathophysiology and enable healthcare professionals to conduct a more accurate patient risk assessment and better predict the clinical outcome of the disease. This narrative review aims to discuss the pathophysiological and behavioral basis of the disproportionate male morbidity and mortality observed in COVID-19, in the context of most research findings in the field.

AB  - Summary
Disruptions to cancer screening services have been experienced in most settings as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ideally, programmes would resolve backlogs by temporarily expanding capacity; however, in practice, this is often not possible. We aim to inform the deliberations of decision makers in high-income settings regarding their cervical cancer screening policy response. We caution against performance measures that rely solely on restoring testing volumes to pre-pandemic levels because they will be less effective at mitigating excess cancer diagnoses than will targeted measures. These measures might exacerbate pre-existing inequalities in accessing cervical screening by disregarding the risk profile of the individuals attending. Modelling of cervical screening outcomes before and during the pandemic supports risk-based strategies as the most effective way for screening services to recover. The degree to which screening is organised will determine the feasibility of deploying some risk-based strategies, but implementation of age-based risk stratification should be universally feasible.

AB  - Severely ill COVID–19 (Corona Virus Disease of 2019) patients have a hyperinflammatory condition with a high concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines termed the cytokine storm. This milieu is reported to cause acute lung injury, oxygen deprivation, multiorgan damage, critical illness, and often death. Post SARS–CoV–2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection, the fight between the invading virus and the host's immune system would either terminate in recovery, with eradication of the infection and regulation of the immune system; or there would be a continuation of immune attacks even after the virus has been cleared, leading to immune dysregulation and disease. This outcome is chiefly dependent on two factors: (1) the patient's immune response, and (2) sufficiency plus efficiency of the regulator(s). Concerning the first, the present research introduces a framework based on different types of immune responses to SARS–CoV–2 along with known disease examples, and how this relates to varying clinical outcomes and treatment needs for COVID–19 patients. About the second factor of ‘regulator(s)’, part 1 of the manuscript described in depth the regulatory role of progesterone in COVID–19. The present study investigates five immunity patterns and the status of the regulatory hormone progesterone with respect to the two established demographic risk factors for COVID–19 high-severity: male sex, and old age. The study evaluates the status of progesterone as a credible determinant of immune regulation and dysregulation. It duly relates the immunity patterns to clinical outcomes and evinces indications for clinical use of progesterone in COVID–19. It proposes a clear answer to the question: "why are males and old patients most likely to have critical illness due to COVID–19?" The study highlights clinical domains for the use of progesterone in COVID–19. Part 2 of this research introduces the concept of immunity patterns and immunity grading. These concepts herewith provided for the clinical course of COVID–19 also apply to other hyperinflammatory conditions. Possible clinical applications of progesterone to treat critically ill COVID–19 patients will open an avenue for hormonal treatments of infections and other immune-related diseases.

AB  - The SARS-2 pandemic which has moved with frightening speed over the last 5 months has several synergies with another older, and far more neglected airborne disease, tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis are not only more likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 but also likely to have adverse outcomes once infected. The sequelae of more severe forms of COVID-19 in patients who have recovered from TB but have residual compromised lung function, are also likely to be devastating. These diseases share almost identical bio-social determinants like poverty, overcrowding, diabetes and pollution and some clinical similarities. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our global response to it with lockdowns, are likely to leave a profound and long-lasting impact on TB diagnosis and control, potentially leading to an additional 6.3 million cases of TB between 2020 and 2025, and an additional 1.4 million TB deaths during this time. Novel solutions will need to be urgently devised or else TB control targets will never be met and indeed may be set back by 5–8 years.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a respiratory tract virus that causes Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The virus originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has spread across the globe to-date. The disease ranges from asymptomatic carriers to symptoms such as fever, sore throat, cough, lung infections, and in severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and death. As many as 50% of patients reported having at least one comorbidities with COVID-19 upon hospital admission. Hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases are among the most commonly reported. Comorbidities are contributing to acute disease prognosis and increased risk of severe symptoms. Around 70% of patients who require ICU care have been observed to have comorbidities. This review intends to understand how some of these comorbidities affect the disease’s prognosis and how severe the outcome can be expected.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the death of over half a million Americans, leaving in its wake widespread grief and despair. Using national survey data (n ​= ​1998) and a treatment-weighting strategy, this study examines how COVID-19 bereavement associates with depressive symptoms and binge drinking. After adjustment for non-random exposure to COVID-19 bereavement, I find that respondents who have lost someone close to them to the virus report greater depressive symptomology and more frequent binge drinking. Among essential workers, the loss of a close tie to COVID-19 exacerbates these associations, with bereavement posing stronger effects for depressive symptoms and binge drinking for members of this group. The implications of these findings for the long-term mental health of the bereaved and those most vulnerable to the virus are discussed.

AB  - Caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) evolves with clinical symptoms that vary widely in severity, from mild symptoms to critical conditions, which can even result in the patient's death. A critical aspect related to an individual response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is the competence of the immune system, and it is well known that several trace elements are essential for an adequate immune response and have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that are of particular importance in fighting infection. Thus, it is widely accepted that adequate trace element status can reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity. In this study, we evaluated the serum levels of Cu, Zn, Se, Fe, I and Mg in patients (n = 210) with clinical conditions of different severity (“mild”, “moderate”, “severe” and “exitus letalis”, i.e., patients who eventually died). The results showed significant differences between the four groups for Cu, Zn, Se and Fe, in particular a significant trend of Zn and Se serum levels to be decreased and Cu to be increased with the severity of symptoms. For Mg and I, no differences were observed, but I levels were shown to be increased in all groups.

AB  - ABSTRACT
The outbreak of the pandemic associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led researchers to find new potential treatments, including nonpharmacological molecules such as zinc (Zn2+). Specifically, the use of Zn2+ as a therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on several findings: 1) the possible role of the anti-inflammatory activity of Zn2+ on the aberrant inflammatory response triggered by COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19), 2) properties of Zn2+ in modulating the competitive balance between the host and the invading pathogens, and 3) the antiviral activity of Zn2+ on a number of pathogens, including coronaviruses. Furthermore, Zn2+ has been found to play a central role in regulating brain functioning and many disorders have been associated with Zn2+ deficiency, including neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, and brain injuries. Within this context, we carried out a narrative review to provide an overview of the evidence relating to the effects of Zn2+ on the immune and nervous systems, and the therapeutic use of such micronutrients in both neurological and infective disorders, with the final goal of elucidating the possible use of Zn2+ as a preventive or therapeutic intervention in COVID-19. Overall, the results from the available evidence showed that, owing to its neuroprotective properties, Zn2+ supplementation could be effective not only on COVID‐19–related symptoms but also on virus replication, as well as on COVID-19–related inflammation and neurological damage. However, further clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of Zn2+ as a nonpharmacological treatment of COVID-19 are required to achieve an overall improvement in outcome and prognosis.

AB  - The devastating pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused thousands of deaths and left millions of restless patients suffering from its complications. Increasing data indicate that the disease presents in a severe form in patients with pre-existing chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory system diseases, and renal diseases. This denotes that these patients are more susceptible to COVID-19 and have higher mortality rates compared to patients with no comorbid conditions. Several factors can explain the heightened susceptibility and fatal presentation of COVID-19 in these patients, for example, the enhanced expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in specific organs, cytokine storm, and drug interactions contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality. Adding to the findings that individuals with pre-existing conditions may be more susceptible to COVID-19, it has also been shown that COVID-19 can induce chronic diseases in previously healthy patients. Therefore, understanding the interlinked relationship between COVID-19 and chronic diseases helps in optimizing the management of susceptible patients. This review comprehensively described the molecular mechanisms that contribute to worse COVID-19 prognosis in patients with pre-existing comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal and renal diseases, blood disorders, autoimmune diseases, and finally, obesity. It also focused on how COVID-19 could, in some cases, lead to chronic conditions as a result of long-term multi-organ damage. Lastly, this work carefully discussed the tailored management plans for each specific patient population, aiming to achieve the best therapeutic outcome with minimum complications.

AB  - To slow the COVID-19 virus, many countries shut down parts of the economy. Older individuals have the most to gain from slowing virus diffusion. Younger workers in shuttered sectors have most to lose. We build a model in which economic activity and disease progression are jointly determined. Individuals differ by age, sector and health status. Disease transmission occurs at work, at home, through consumption, and in hospitals. Optimal economic shutdowns in 2020 are milder when taxes are distortionary, and when the government does not have access to debt. A harder, shorter shutdown is preferred when vaccines become available in early 2021.

AB  - Rationale & Objective
Recent studies showed that antibody titers after vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the dialysis population are diminished as compared with the general population, suggesting the possible value of a third booster dose. We characterized the humoral response after 3 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients treated with either maintenance hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD).
Study Design
Case series.
Setting & Participants
69 French patients (38 HD and 31 PD) treated at a single center who received 3 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine.
Findings
Humoral response was evaluated using plasma levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 immunoglobulin measured after the second dose and at least 3 weeks after the third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Patients (median age 68 years [interquartile range (IQR), 53-76 years], 65% men) had a median anti-S1 antibody level of 284 [IQR, 83-1190] AU/mL after the second dose, and 7,554 [IQR, 2,268-11,736] AU/mL after the third dose. Three patients were nonresponders (anti-S1 antibody level < 0.8 AU/mL), and 12 were weak responders (anti-S1 antibody level 0.8-50 AU/mL) after the second vaccine dose. After the third dose, 1 of the 3 initial nonresponders produced anti-spike antibody, and all the 12 initial weak responders increased their antibody levels. Patients with a greater increase in anti-S1 antibody levels after a third dose had lower antibody levels after the second dose, and a longer time interval between the second and the third dose. Adverse events did not seem to be more common or severe after a third vaccine dose.
Limitations
Observational study, small sample size. Relationship between antibody levels and clinical outcomes is not well understood.
Conclusions
A third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine substantially increased antibody levels in patients receiving maintenance dialysis and appeared to be as well tolerated as a second dose.

AB  - One of the most significant threats to global health since the Second World War is the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to COVID-19 widespread social, environmental, economic, and health concerns. Other unfavourable factors also emerged, including increased trash brought on by high consumption of packaged foods, takeout meals, packaging from online shopping, and the one-time use of plastic products. Due to labour shortages and residents staying at home during mandatory lockdowns, city municipal administrations' collection and recycling capacities have decreased, frequently damaging the environment (air, water, and soil) and ecological and human systems. The COVID-19 challenges are more pronounced in unofficial settlements of developing nations, particularly for developing nations of the world, as their fundamental necessities, such as air quality, water quality, trash collection, sanitation, and home security, are either non-existent or difficult to obtain. According to reports, during the pandemic's peak days (20 August 2021 (741 K cases), 8 million tonnes of plastic garbage were created globally, and 25 thousand tonnes of this waste found its way into the ocean. This thorough analysis attempts to assess the indirect effects of COVID-19 on the environment, human systems, and water quality that pose dangers to people and potential remedies. Strong national initiatives could facilitate international efforts to attain environmental sustainability goals. Significant policies should be formulated like good quality air, pollution reduction, waste management, better sanitation system, and personal hygiene. This review paper also elaborated that further investigations are needed to investigate the magnitude of impact and other related factors for enhancement of human understanding of ecosystem to manage the water, environment and human encounter problems during epidemics/pandemics in near future.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia worldwide, is associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. Previous studies suggest only a portion of vaccinated CLL patients develop severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike antibodies. Whether the elicited antibodies are functional and/or accompanied by functional T-cell responses is unknown. This prospective cohort study included patients with CLL who received SARS-CoV-2 and PCV13 vaccines (not concurrently). The primary cohort included adults with CLL off therapy. Coprimary outcomes were serologic response to SARS-CoV-2 (receptor binding domain [RBD] immunoassay) and PCV13 vaccines (23-serotype IgG assay). Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and their functional activity and assessment of functional T-cell responses was performed. Sixty percent (18/30) of patients demonstrated serologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, appearing more frequent among treatment-naïve patients (72%). Among treatment-naïve patients, an absolute lymphocyte count ≤24 000/µL was associated with serologic response (94% vs 14%; P < .001). On interferon-γ release assays, 80% (16/20) of patients had functional spike-specific T-cell responses, including 78% (7/9) with a negative RBD immunoassay, a group enriched for prior B-cell–depleting therapies. A bead-based multiplex immunoassay identified antibodies against wild-type and variant SARS-CoV-2 (α, β, γ, and δ) in all tested patients and confirmed Fc-receptor binding and effector functions of these antibodies. Of 11 patients with negative RBD immunoassay after vaccination, 6 (55%) responded to an additional mRNA-based vaccine dose. The PCV13 serologic response rate was 29% (8/28). Our data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination induces functional T-cell and antibody responses in patients with CLL and provides the framework for investigating the molecular mechanisms and clinical benefit of these responses. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT05007860.

AB  - Aims
We aimed to briefly review the general characteristics of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and provide a better understanding of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in people with diabetes, and its management.
Methods
We searched for articles in PubMed and Google Scholar databases till 02 April 2020, with the following keywords: “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “infection”, “pathogenesis”, “incubation period”, “transmission”, “clinical features”, “diagnosis”, “treatment”, “diabetes”, with interposition of the Boolean operator “AND”.
Results
The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death. Older age, diabetes and other comorbidities are reported as significant predictors of morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation, increased coagulation activity, immune response impairment, and potential direct pancreatic damage by SARS-CoV-2 might be among the underlying mechanisms of the association between diabetes and COVID-19. No conclusive evidence exists to support the discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers or thiazolidinediones because of COVID-19 in people with diabetes. Caution should be taken to potential hypoglycemic events with the use of chloroquine in these subjects. Patient tailored therapeutic strategies, rigorous glucose monitoring and careful consideration of drug interactions might reduce adverse outcomes.
Conclusions
Suggestions are made on the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19, and its management. No definite conclusions can be made based on current limited evidence. Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted.

AB  - Objectives
The COVID-19 pandemic put into question the organizational skills of LTCF. The containment measures implemented in several Asian countries avoided heavy death tolls in LTCF in contrast to other countries across the globe. The aim of this review is therefore to investigate and illustrate the measures that were undertaken in Asia to contain and prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in LTCF.
Design
Narrative review.
Setting and Participants
Asian older subjects institutionalized in LTCF.
Methods
Broad literature research from July 2020–April 2021. The following search terms were used: “COVID-19 Nursing homes” AND the country of interest or “contact tracing.” Eligible categories for inclusion comprise editorials, reviews, government guidelines, letters to the editor, and perspectives. The COVID-19 measures were then subdivided into different sections and compiled into an evidence table.
Results
Prompt measures were put into action since the beginning of the pandemic that avoided the spread of COVID-19 in LTCF. Examples range from simple acts of proper hand hygiene and environmental disinfection, swab testing, social distancing, preventive measures on health care workers, organizational measures such as quarantine, outbreak control, visitor restrictions, relationship with acute hospitals, and admission policy. Technology also played a fundamental role in promoting social distancing by using specific robots and in managing contact tracing.
Conclusions and Implications
The Asian preventive control guidelines are similar to those recommended elsewhere. Difference in timing and past experience with prior outbreaks such as SARS and MERS might have favored the Asian response. Furthermore, sociocultural values toward older persons by protecting and making sure that LTCF are part of the health care system could have also played a role.

AB  - Interferons are the best antiviral agents in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 so far and genetic defects in their signaling cascade or neutralization of alfa-interferons by autoantibodies come with more severe COVID-19. However, there is more, as the SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates not only innate immune mechanisms but also T and B cell repertoires. Most genetic, hematological and immunological studies in COVID-19 are at present phenomenological. However, these and antecedent studies contain the seed grains to resolve many unanswered questions and a whole range of testable hypotheses. What are the links, if existing, between genetics and the occurrence of interferon-neutralizing antibodies? Are NAGGED (neutralizing and generated by gene defect) antibodies involved or not? Is the autoimmune process cause or consequence of virus infection? What are the roles played by cytokine posttranslational modifications, such as proteolysis, glycosylation, citrullination and others? How is systemic autoimmunity linked with type 1 interferons? These questions place cytokines and growth factors at pole positions as keys to unlock basic mechanisms of infection and (auto)immunity. Related to cytokine research, (1) COVID-19 patients develop neutralizing autoantibodies, mainly against alpha interferons and it is not yet established whether this is the consequence or cause of virus replication. (2) The glycosylation of recombinant interferon-beta protects against breaking tolerance and the development of neutralizing antibodies. (3) SARS-CoV-2 induces severe inflammation and release of extracellular proteases leading to remnant epitopes, e.g. of cytokines. (4) In the rare event of homozygous cytokine gene segment deletions, observed neutralizing antibodies may be named NAGGED antibodies. (5) Severe cytolysis releases intracellular content into the extracellular milieu and leads to regulated degradation of intracellular proteins and selection of antibody repertoires, similar to those observed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. (6) Systematic studies of novel autoimmune diseases on single cytokines will complement the present picture about interferons. (7) Interferon neutralization in COVID-19 constitutes a preamble of more studies about cytokine-regulated proteolysis in the control of autoimmunity. Here we reformulate these seven conjectures into testable questions for future research.

AB  - Background
Breast Cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic affected healthcare delivery throughout North America. Breast cancer diagnosis and management was similarly affected.
Methods
We conducted a scoping review to determine the impact of COVID-19 on BC care and the impact on patients’ well-being.
Results
Our review found that the pandemic led to changes in screenings, biopsies, medical therapy, and surgery. Constraints of the pandemic left patients without resources to navigate the emotional toll from social distancing. There was a disparity in patients’ perceptions of the impact of the pandemic on BC care.
Conclusion
Although the pandemic altered medical care in general, we found that the impact on breast cancer care was counterintuitively not as significant as predicted. However, the pandemic did impact breast cancer patients’ mental well-being. This highlights the importance of properly communicating, in real-time, guidelines on breast cancer management to allay the fears of the general public.

AB  - ABSTRACT
During the first year of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, many drugs and drug candidates have been evaluated as treatment options. None yet has proved to be an effective cure, but progress in controlling the disease has been made. In June 2020 we published an article that described the mechanistic rationale behind the repurposing of seven licensed drugs in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 and reviewed synthetic routes to these drugs. Several developments have occurred since then. Remdesivir (trade name Veklury) has been approved for use in the U.S. and Europe. Dexamethasone, a steroid drug first approved in 1959, has shown mortality reduction in severe COVID patients. Molnupiravir, a new and promising oral antiviral drug, is being studied in late-stage clinical trials. In this review, we update synthetic work that has been recently published on remdesivir, provide an overview of several routes to molnupiravir, and review classical routes to dexamethasone as well as some of those more recently developed.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first reported in Wuhan, China, has rapidly spread worldwide. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used to prevent and treat viral epidemics and plagues for over 2,500 years. In the guidelines on fighting against COVID-19, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China has recommended certain TCM formulas, namely Jinhua Qinggan granule (JHQGG), Lianhua Qingwen granule (LHQWG), Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPDD), Xuanfei Baidu granule (XFBD), Xuebijing injection (XBJ), and Huashi Baidu granule (HSBD) for treating COVID-19 infected individuals. Among these six TCM formulas, JHQGG and LHQWG effectively treated mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 infections. XFBD therapy is recommended for mild COVID-19 infections, while XBJ and HSBD effectively treat severe COVID-19 infections. The internationalization of TCM faces many challenges due to the absence of a clinical efficacy evaluation system, insufficient research evidence, and a lack of customer trust across the globe. Therefore, evidence-based research is crucial in battling this infectious disease. This review summarizes SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the history of TCM used to treat various viral epidemics, with a focus on six TCM formulas. Based on the evidence, we also discuss the composition of various TCM formulas, their underlying therapeutic mechanisms, and their role in curing COVID-19 infections. In addition, we evaluated the roles of six TCM formulas in the treatment and prevention of other influenza diseases, such as influenza A (H1N1), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Furthermore, we highlighted the efficacy and side effects of single prescriptions used in TCM formulas.

We will likely look back on 2020 as a turning point. The pandemic put a spotlight on existing societal issues, accelerated the pace of change in others, and created some new ones too. For example, concerns about inequalities in health by income and race are not new, but they became more apparent to a larger number of people during 2020. The speed and starkness of broadening societal conversation, including beyond the direct effects of COVID-19, create an opportunity and motivation to reassess our understanding of health. Perhaps more importantly, it is an opportunity to reduce inequities in who has access to, who uses, and who benefits from the resources that promote health and well-being. To this end, we offer three questions to guide thinking about health and health inequities after 2020: (1) what do we mean by “health” and “health inequality and inequity”? (2) what are the structures and policies we put in place to support or promote health, and how effective are they? And (3) who has the power to shape structures and policies, and whose interests do those structures and policies serve?

KW  - Contamination fear
AB  - The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has broadly increased anxiety and changed individual behavior. However, there is limited research examining predictors of pandemic-related changes, and the majority of existing research is cross-sectional in nature, which limits causal inference. Given functional links with disease avoidance processes, individual differences in contamination fear may be especially relevant in predicting responses to COVID-19. Accordingly, the present study prospectively examines contamination fear and obsessive-compulsive washing symptoms as predictors of anxiety and safety behaviors in response to COVID-19 in a student sample (N = 108). To examine specificity, anxiety and safety behaviors in response to seasonal influenza are also examined. In the early stages of the pandemic (March 2020), coronavirus-related anxiety was higher than flu-related anxiety (d = 1.38). Obsessive-compulsive washing symptoms also increased from before the pandemic (d = 0.4). Although baseline contamination fear and obsessive-compulsive washing symptoms did not significantly predict coronavirus-related anxiety, contamination fear did significantly predict safety behavior usage in response to both COVID-19 and influenza. The specificity of the prospective association between contamination fear and the use of safety behaviors are discussed in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the broader literature on the role of safety behaviors in anxiety.

AB  - Summary
SARS-CoV-2 infection has emerged as a serious global pandemic. Because of the high transmissibility of the virus and the high rate of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, developing effective and safe vaccines is a top research priority. Here, we provide a detailed evaluation of the immunogenicity of lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA (mRNA-LNP) vaccines encoding the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or the spike receptor binding domain in mice. We demonstrate that a single dose of these vaccines induces strong type 1 CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, as well as long-lived plasma and memory B cell responses. Additionally, we detect robust and sustained neutralizing antibody responses and the antibodies elicited by nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines do not show antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in vitro. Our findings suggest that the nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccine platform can induce robust immune responses and is a promising candidate to combat COVID-19.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is more serious in people with underlying diseases, but the cause of healthy people with progressive disease is largely unknown. Host genetic factors such as ACE2 variants, IFITM-3, HLA, TMRSS2, and furin polymorphisms appear to be one of the agents involved in the progression of the COVID-19 and outcome of the disease. This review discusses the general characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including viral features, receptors, cell entry, clinical findings, and the main human genetic factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and get the patients’ situation more complex. Further knowledge in this context may help to find a way to prevent and treat this viral pneumonia.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 has quickly spread throughout the world, necessitating assessment of effective containment methods. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of government mandated school closures, stay at home orders and mask requirements
Methods
Cumulative incidence rates were calculated at 14-day intervals until the day of the first vaccine administration in the country. Rate ratios were calculated using negative binomial regression while investigating the effects of adjusting for several sociodemographic and medical factors
Results
Faster implementation of mask mandates was consistently shown to be protective. States with mask mandates made at three to six months had a 1.61 times higher rate than those who implemented within one month (adjusted rate ratio = 1.61, 95% confidence interval: 1.23-2.10, P = .001). States with mask mandates made after 6 months or with no mandate had a 2.16 times higher rate than those who implemented within 1 month (adjusted rate ratio = 2.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.64-2.88, P < .0001). In contrast, both stay at home orders and school closures had no significant influence on disease trajectory.
Discussion
The benefits of mask mandates are apparent, especially when mandates were issued within a month. The impact of school closing and stay at home orders were less clear.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that of the different physical distancing measures implemented by the government, mask mandates are the most important.

AB  - The clinical course of COVID-19 presents a broad spectrum, being asymptomatic in some individuals while following a severe course and resulting in mortality in others. It is known that such factors as age and chronic diseases can result in a different clinical courses in individuals, however, variable clinical courses among the similar individuals in terms of age and chronic diseases are also seen. Other possible factors affecting the course of the disease that are mostly speculative or under investigation are genetic factors and the origin of transmission or possible subtype of novel coronavirus. Whether the source of transmission is important in the clinical course of the disease is unknown. A case series composed of seven individuals in a similar age group, with different lines of descent and different genetic structures, but who were infected from the same source is presented here. The similar and different clinical, laboratory and radiological findings of the cases residing in the same nursing home, who presented to the hospital altogether, were evaluated. The aim of the study was to analyze whether the source of transmission is influential in the clinical course of the disease.

AB  - A large proportion of Americans have at least one disability and yet people with disabilities face inequities in health and health care access. Factors associated with underlying disability and health, how they perceive and interact with the world, and where they live, or work may increase the risk people with disabilities face for illness or severe outcomes from seasonal influenza. Given the need to reduce the burden of respiratory illness on a healthcare system already overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic, maximizing seasonal influenza vaccination coverage is particularly important in 2020–2021. It is critical this season to ensure equitable access to influenza vaccination for people with disabilities. Providing influenza vaccination services in the unique places where people with disabilities are living, working, or receiving care during the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial, as well as communicating effectively to people with different types of disabilities.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has taken the world by surprise into a major crisis of overwhelming morbidity and mortality. This highly infectious disease is associated with respiratory failure unusual in other coronavirus infections. Mounting evidence link the accelerated progression of the disease in COVID-19 patients to the hyper-inflammatory state termed as the “cytokine storm” involving major systemic perturbations. These include iron dysregulation manifested as hyperferritinemia associated with disease severity. Iron dysregulation induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and promotes oxidative stress. The mitochondria are the hub of cellular oxidative homeostasis. In addition, the mitochondria may circulate “cell-free” in non-nucleated platelets, in extracellular vesicles and mitochondrial DNA is found in the extracellular space. The heightened inflammatory/oxidative state may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction leading to platelet damage and apoptosis. The interaction of dysfunctional platelets with coagulation cascades aggravates clotting events and thrombus formation. Furthermore, mitochondrial oxidative stress may contribute to microbiota dysbiosis, altering coagulation pathways and fueling the inflammatory/oxidative response leading to the vicious cycle of events. Here, we discuss various cellular and systemic incidents caused by SARS-CoV-2 that may critically impact intra and extracellular mitochondrial function, and contribute to the progression and severity of the disease. It is crucial to understand how these key modulators impact COVID-19 pathogenesis in the quest to identify novel therapeutic targets that may reduce fatal outcomes of the disease.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) has caused major public health crises. There have been more than 4,400,000 reported cases of COVID-2019 and more than 300,000 reported deaths to date (16/05/2020). SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have attracted widespread global attention due to their high infectivity and pathogenicity. To date, there is no specific treatment proven effective against these viral infectious diseases. Vaccination is considered one of the most effective strategies to prevent viral infections. Therefore, the development of effective vaccines against highly pathogenic coronaviruses is essential. In this review, we will briefly describe coronavirus vaccine design targets, summarize recent advances in the development of coronavirus vaccines, and highlight current adjuvants for improving the efficacy of coronavirus vaccines.

AB  - Summary
Background
Non-clinical evidence and a few human studies with short follow-ups suggest increased risk of dyslipidaemia in the post-acute phase of COVID-19 (ie, >30 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection). However, detailed large-scale controlled studies with longer follow-ups and in-depth assessment of the risks and burdens of incident dyslipidaemia in the post-acute phase of COVID-19 are not yet available. We, therefore, aimed to examine the risks and 1-year burdens of incident dyslipidaemia in the post-acute phase of COVID-19 among people who survive the first 30 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods
In this cohort study, we used the national health-care databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to build a cohort of 51 919 participants who had a positive COVID-19 test and survived the first 30 days of infection between March 1, 2020, and Jan 15, 2021; a non-infected contemporary control group (n=2 647 654) that enrolled patients between March 1, 2020, and Jan 15, 2021; and a historical control group (n=2 539 941) that enrolled patients between March 1, 2018, and Jan 15, 2019. Control groups had no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and participants in all three cohorts were free of dyslipidaemia before cohort enrolment. We then used inverse probability weighting using predefined and algorithmically-selected high dimensional variables to estimate the risks and 1-year burdens of incident dyslipidaemia, lipid-lowering medications use, and a composite of these outcomes. We reported two measures of risk: hazard ratios (HRs) and burden per 1000 people at 12 months. Additionally, we estimated the risks and burdens of incident dyslipidaemia outcomes in mutually exclusive groups based on the care setting of the acute infection (ie, participants who were non-hospitalised, hospitalised, or admitted to intensive care during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection).
Findings
In the post-acute phase of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared with the non-infected contemporary control group, those in the COVID-19 group had higher risks and burdens of incident dyslipidaemia, including total cholesterol greater than 200 mg/dL (hazard ratio [HR] 1·26, 95% CI 1·22–1·29; burden 22·46, 95% CI 19·14–25·87 per 1000 people at 1 year), triglycerides greater than 150 mg/dL (1·27, 1·23–1·31; 22·03, 18·85–25·30), LDL cholesterol greater than 130 mg/dL (1·24, 1·20–1·29; 18·00, 14·98–21·11), and HDL cholesterol lower than 40 mg/dL (1·20, 1·16–1·25; 15·58, 12·52–18·73). The risk and burden of a composite of these abnormal lipid laboratory outcomes were 1·24 (95% CI 1·21–1·27) and 39·19 (95% CI 34·71–43·73), respectively. There was also increased risk and burden of incident lipid-lowering medications use (HR 1·54, 95% CI 1·48–1·61; burden 25·50, 95% CI 22·61–28·50). A composite of any dyslipidaemia outcome (laboratory abnormality or lipid-lowering medications use) yielded an HR of 1·31 (95% CI 1·28–1·34) and a burden of 54·03 (95% CI 49·21–58·92). The risks and burdens of these post-acute outcomes increased in a graded fashion corresponding to the severity of the acute phase of COVID-19 infection (ie, whether patients were non-hospitalised, hospitalised, or admitted to intensive care). The results were consistent in analyses comparing the COVID-19 group to the non-infected historical control group.
Interpretation
Our findings suggest increased risks and 1-year burdens of incident dyslipidaemia and incident lipid-lowering medications use in the post-acute phase of COVID-19 infection. Post-acute care for those with COVID-19 should involve attention to dyslipidaemia as a potential post-acute sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Background
A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has taken the world by storm. The disease has spread very swiftly worldwide. A timely clue which includes the estimation of the incubation period among COVID-19 patients can allow governments and healthcare authorities to act accordingly.
Objectives
to undertake a review and critical appraisal of all published/preprint reports that offer an estimation of incubation periods for COVID-19.
Eligibility criteria
This research looked for all relevant published articles between the dates of December 1, 2019, and April 25, 2020, i.e. those that were related to the COVID-19 incubation period. Papers were included if they were written in English, and involved human participants. Papers were excluded if they were not original (e.g. reviews, editorials, letters, commentaries, or duplications).
Sources of evidence
COVID-19 Open Research Dataset supplied by Georgetown’s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology as well as PubMed and Embase via Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv.
Charting methods
A data-charting form was jointly developed by the two reviewers (NZ and EA), to determine which variables to extract. The two reviewers independently charted the data, discussed the results, and updated the data-charting form.
Results and conclusions
Screening was undertaken 44,000 articles with a final selection of 25 studies referring to 18 different experimental projects related to the estimation of the incubation period of COVID-19. The majority of extant published estimates offer empirical evidence showing that the incubation period for the virus is a mean of 7.8 days, with a median of 5.01 days, which falls into the ranges proposed by the WHO (0–14 days) and the ECDC (2–12 days). Nevertheless, a number of authors proposed that quarantine time should be a minimum of 14 days and that for estimates of mortality risks a median time delay of 13 days between illness and mortality should be under consideration. It is unclear as to whether any correlation exists between the age of patients and the length of time they incubate the virus.

AB  - Summary
Clinical research is necessary for an effective response to an emerging infectious disease outbreak. However, research efforts are often hastily organised and done using various research tools, with the result that pooling data across studies is challenging. In response to the needs of the rapidly evolving COVID-19 outbreak, the Clinical Characterisation and Management Working Group of the WHO Research and Development Blueprint programme, the International Forum for Acute Care Trialists, and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium have developed a minimum set of common outcome measures for studies of COVID-19. This set includes three elements: a measure of viral burden (quantitative PCR or cycle threshold), a measure of patient survival (mortality at hospital discharge or at 60 days), and a measure of patient progression through the health-care system by use of the WHO Clinical Progression Scale, which reflects patient trajectory and resource use over the course of clinical illness. We urge investigators to include these key data elements in ongoing and future studies to expedite the pooling of data during this immediate threat, and to hone a tool for future needs.

AB  - Do partisan preferences, the electoral system, checks on government, political fragmentation, civil liberties and trust contribute to explaining the stringency of containment policies in European countries? Empirical studies suggest that political science theories have helped very little in understanding European democracies' political response to the pandemic's first wave. We argue in this article that the negligible effect of politics, broadly defined, is confined to the first wave and that during subsequent waves over the autumn 2020 to spring 2021 season some of the above political factors contribute to our understanding of variation in countries' response. Employing a sample of 26 European democracies analyzing daily data on the stringency of adopted containment policies we provide evidence that politics does not matter during the first wave but is substantively important during later waves.

AB  - Summary
Background
ZyCoV-D, a DNA-based vaccine, showed promising safety and immunogenicity in a phase 1/2 trial. We now report the interim efficacy results of phase 3 clinical trial with ZyCoV-D vaccine in India.
Methods
We conducted an interim analysis of a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial at 49 centres in India. Healthy participants aged at least 12 years were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either ZyCov-D vaccine (Cadila Healthcare; 2 mg per dose) or placebo. An interactive web response system was used for randomisation (blocks of four) of participants as well as to enrol those aged 60 years and older with or without comorbid conditions, and those aged 12–17 years. It was also used to identify 600 participants for immunogenicity (blocks of six). Participants, investigators, and outcome assessors were masked to treatment assignment. Three doses of vaccine or placebo were administered intradermally via a needle-free injection system 28 days apart. The primary outcome was the number of participants with first occurrence of symptomatic RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 28 days after the third dose, until the targeted number of cases (interim analysis n=79, full analysis n=158) have been achieved. The analysis was done in the per-protocol population, which consisted of all participants with negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status who received three doses of vaccine or placebo. Assessment of safety and tolerability was based on the safety population, which consisted of all enrolled participants who were known to have received at least one dose of study vaccine or placebo. This trial is registered with Clinical Trial Registry India, CTRI/2021/01/030416, and is ongoing.
Findings
Between Jan 16, and June 23, 2021 (data cutoff), 33 194 individuals were screened, of whom 5241 did not meet screening criteria and 27 703 were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive ZyCoV-D (n=13 851) or placebo (n=13 852). Per-protocol, 81 cases were eligible and included in efficacy analysis (20 of 12 350 in the ZyCoV-D group and 61 of 12 320 in placebo group). The ZyCoV-D vaccine efficacy was found to be 66·6% (95% CI 47·6–80·7). The occurrence of solicited adverse events was similar between the treatment groups (623 [4·49%] in the ZyCoV-D group vs 620 [4·47%] in the placebo group). There were two deaths (one in each group) reported at the data cutoff, neither of which was considered related to the study treatments.
Interpretation
In this interim analysis, ZyCoV-D vaccine was found to be efficacious, safe, and immunogenic in a phase 3 trial.

AB  - The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic heightened the pace of vaccine development with various vaccines being approved for human use in a span of 24 months. The SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike (S) surface glycoprotein, which mediates viral entry by binding to ACE2, is a key target for vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. Plant biopharming is recognized for its scalability, speed, versatility, and low production costs and is an increasingly promising molecular pharming vaccine platform for human health. We developed Nicotiana benthamiana-produced SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidates displaying the S-protein of the Beta (B.1.351) variant of concern (VOC), which triggered cross-reactive neutralising antibodies against Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529) VOCs. In this study, immunogenicity of the VLPs (5 µg per dose) adjuvanted with three independent adjuvants i.e. oil-in-water based adjuvants SEPIVAC SWETM (Seppic, France) and “AS IS” (Afrigen, South Africa) as well as a slow-release synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) adjuvant designated NADA (Disease Control Africa, South Africa) were evaluated in New Zealand white rabbits and resulted in robust neutralising antibody responses after booster vaccination, ranging from 1:5341 to as high as 1:18204. Serum neutralising antibodies elicited by the Beta variant VLP vaccine also showed cross-neutralisation against the Delta and Omicron variants with neutralising titres ranging from 1:1702 and 1:971, respectively. Collectively, these data provide support for the development of a plant-produced VLP based candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 based on circulating variants of concern.

AB  - Seasonal influenza vaccination rates remain low, and contribute to preventable influenza cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US. While numerous interventions have been implemented to increase vaccine uptake, there is a need to determine which interventions contribute most to vaccine willingness, particularly among age groups with vaccination rates that have plateaued at suboptimal levels. This study aimed to quantify the relative effect of multiple interventions on vaccine willingness to receive influenza vaccine in three age groups using a series of hypothetical situations with different behavioral interventions. We assessed the relative impact of four categories of interventions: source of vaccine messages, type of vaccination messages, vaccination incentives, and ease of vaccine access using a discrete choice experiment. Within each category, we investigated the role of four different attributes to measure their relative contribution to willingness to be vaccinated by removing one option from each of the intervention categories. Among the 1,763 Minnesota residents who volunteered for our study, participants expressed vaccine willingness in over 80% of the scenarios presented. Easy access to drop-in vaccination sites had the greatest impact on vaccine willingness in all age groups. Among the younger age group, small financial incentives also contributed to high vaccine willingness. Our results suggest that public health programs and vaccination campaigns may improve their chances of successfully increasing vaccine willingness if they offer interventions preferred by adults, including facilitating convenient access to vaccination and offering small monetary incentives, particularly for young adults.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for acute respiratory disease affected other organs leading to co-existence symptoms or complications. Thyroid gland was one of them due to expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the protein facilitating viral binding to the host cells. Moreover, thyroid gland, important for regulation of hormonal network, is extremely sensitive to any changes in homeostasis and metabolism. It was shown, that COVID-19 was associated with induction of thyroid disease or increasing existing functional disturbances or autoimmune process. Thyroid diseases are mainly based on immunological pathomechanism although the relation between immune system and thyroid function is bidirectional e.g. thyroid hormones modulate specific immune responses, including cell-mediated immunity, NK cell activity, the production of antiviral interferon (IFN) and proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes. The effects of COVID-19 and mRNA vaccine on thyroid function and diseases are discussed.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and previous pandemics have been viewed almost exclusively as virology problems, with toxicology problems mostly being ignored. This perspective is not supported by the evolution of COVID-19, where the impact of real-life exposures to multiple toxic stressors degrading the immune system is followed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus exploiting the degraded immune system to trigger a chain of events ultimately leading to COVID-19. This immune system degradation from multiple toxic stressors (chemical, physical, biological, psychosocial stressors) means that attribution of serious consequences from COVID-19 should be made to the virus-toxic stressors nexus, not to any of the nexus constituents in isolation. The leading toxic stressors (identified in this study as contributing to COVID-19) are pervasive, contributing to myriad chronic diseases as well as immune system degradation. They increase the likelihood for comorbidities and mortality associated with COVID-19. For the short-term, tactical/reactive virology-focused treatments are of higher priority than strategic/proactive toxicology-focused treatments, although both could be implemented in parallel to reinforce each other. However, for long-term pandemic prevention, toxicology-based approaches should be given higher priority than virology-based approaches. Since current COVID-19 treatments globally ignore the toxicology component almost completely, only limited benefits can be expected from these treatments.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic imposed two lockdowns of eight and six weeks in France. While access to care was reduced during lockdown periods, these stressful situations with the pandemic and lockdown periods may have a negative impact on mental health, especially in vulnerable subgroups. Monitoring of psychotropic drugs consumption in France is a comprehensive and reliable tool for indirectly analyzing the mental health of French people. This historical cohort study (n = 767 147) investigated the short-term and long-term evolution of the weekly trend of psychotropic drugs users in 2020 by performing a Seasonal Trend decomposition time series analysis. Rate of progression of consumers per week increased from 186 in the last week of 2019 to 261 per week in the last week of 2020 (+40.3%). Our results did not show a significant break in psychotropic drugs consumption trends during the year 2020 and its two lockdowns. The increase in trend regarding psychotropic drugs consumptions was greatest in young people (<15 years) and patients not being socially deprived. Despite the increase in consumers with restrictive health measures, the French drugs delivery system has been able to adapt with the support of government and pharmacy network. This point should be kept in mind as the necessary reforms to the health care system are undertaken. The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on mental health and two lockdowns occurred in France with reduced access to care. In this context, monitoring of psychotropic drugs consumption is a comprehensive and reliable tool for analyzing the mental health of French people. We hypothesized that the psychotropic drugs consumption has increased during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, testifying to French people mental health deterioration, with psychotropic drugs consumption breaks during lockdowns, especially during the first “grand national lockdown”, due to the closure or difficulties for accessing to health care structures. By carrying out a historical cohort study among Pays de la Loire residents (n = 767 147), we investigated evolution of the weekly trend of psychotropic drugs users in 2020 compared to 2019 by performing a Seasonal Trend decomposition time series analysis. Between 2019 to 2020, we found a + 40.3% rate of progression of consumers per week. During the year 2020, changes in trend regarding psychotropic drugs consumptions was observed in various sub-groups, e.g. greater in the youngest (< 15 years), which may indicate a vulnerable group strongly impacted by COVID-19 negative consequences, and patients not being socially deprived, which may indicate a group with probably an easier access to care. Lockdown periods were not associated with a significant change in psychotropic drug use, suggesting a form of resilience in the French health care system to maintain its capacity to deliver psychotropic treatments. We mainly discussed that despite the increase in consumers and the policies of restricting access to care during lockdown periods, the French drugs delivery system has been able to adapt thanks to supportive policy actions (extension of the prescriptions validity without the need for a renewal by a physician during periods of lockdowns), an efficient pharmacy network with a collaborative practice of health actors that need to be developed and/or conserved to face potential future health crises.

AB  - The epidemic of pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been listed as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO), and its harm degree is defined as a global “pandemic”. At present, the efforts of various countries focus on the rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients, as well as to find a treatment that can combat the most serious impact of the disease. The number of reported COVID-19 virus infections is still increasing. Unfortunately, no drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of human coronaviruses, but there is an urgent need for in-depth research on emerging human infectious coronaviruses. Clarification transmission routes and pathogenic mechanisms, and identification of potential drug treatment targets will promote the development of effective prevention and treatment measures. In the absence of confirmed effective treatments, due to public health emergencies, it is essential to study the possible effects of existing approved antivirals drugs or Chinese herbal medicines for SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, pathogenesis, virus structure and targeting strategies of COVID-19. Meanwhile, this review also focus on the re-purposing of clinically approved drugs and Chinese herbal medicines that may be used to treat COVID-19 and provide new ideas for the discovery of small molecular compounds with potential therapeutic effects on novel COVID-19.

AB  - This paper conducts a comparative review of the (curative) health systems’ response taken by Cyprus, Greece, Israel, Italy, Malta, Portugal, and Spain during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, these Mediterranean countries shared similarities in terms of health system resources, which were low compared to the EU/OECD average. We distill key policy insights regarding the governance tools adopted to manage the pandemic, the means to secure sufficient physical infrastructure and workforce capacity and some financing and coverage aspects. We performed a qualitative analysis of the evidence reported to the ‘Health System Response Monitor’ platform of the European Observatory by country experts. We found that governance in the early stages of the pandemic was undertaken centrally in all the Mediterranean countries, even in Italy and Spain where regional authorities usually have autonomy over health matters. Stretched public resources prompted countries to deploy “flexible” intensive care unit capacity and health workforce resources as agile solutions. The private sector was also utilized to expand resources and health workforce capacity, through special public-private partnerships. Countries ensured universal coverage for COVID-19-related services, even for groups not usually entitled to free publicly financed health care, such as undocumented migrants. We conclude that flexibility, speed and adaptive management in health policy responses were key to responding to immediate needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial barriers to accessing care as well as potentially higher mortality rates were avoided in most of the countries during the first wave. Yet it is still early to assess to what extent countries were able to maintain essential services without undermining equitable access to high quality care.

AB  - Despite tremendous global efforts since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, still only a limited number of prophylactic and therapeutic options are available. Although vaccination is the most effective measure in preventing morbidity and mortality, there is a need for safe and effective post-infection treatment medication. In this study, we explored a pipeline of 21 potential candidates, examined in the Calu-3 cell line for their antiviral efficacy, for drug repurposing. Ralimetinib and nafamostat, clinically used drugs, have emerged as attractive candidates. Due to the inherent limitations of the selected drugs, we formulated targeted liposomes suitable for both systemic and intranasal administration. Non-targeted and targeted nafamostat liposomes (LipNaf) decorated with an Apolipoprotein B peptide (ApoB-P) as a specific lung-targeting ligand were successfully developed. The developed liposomal formulations of nafamostat were found to possess favorable physicochemical properties including nano size (119–147 nm), long-term stability of the normally rapidly degrading compound in aqueous solution, negligible leakage from the liposomes upon storage, and a neutral surface charge with low polydispersity index (PDI). Both nafamostat and ralimetinib liposomes showed good cellular uptake and lack of cytotoxicity, and non-targeted LipNaf demonstrated enhanced accumulation in the lungs following intranasal (IN) administration in non-infected mice. LipNaf retained its anti-SARS-CoV 2 activity in Calu 3 cells with only a modest decrease, exhibiting complete inhibition at concentrations >100 nM. IN, but not intraperitoneal (IP) treatment with targeted LipNaf resulted in a trend to reduced viral load in the lungs of K18-hACE2 mice compared to targeted empty Lip. Nevertheless, upon removal of outlier data, a statistically significant 1.9-fold reduction in viral load was achieved. This observation further highlights the importance of a targeted delivery into the respiratory tract. In summary, we were able to demonstrate a proof-of-concept of drug repurposing by liposomal formulations with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The biodistribution and bioactivity studies with LipNaf suggest an IN or inhalation route of administration for optimal therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - Summary
Background
Workplaces are an important potential source of SARS-CoV-2 exposure; however, investigation into workplace contact patterns is lacking. This study aimed to investigate how workplace attendance and features of contact varied between occupations across the COVID-19 pandemic in England.
Methods
Data were obtained from electronic contact diaries (November 2020-November 2021) submitted by employed/self-employed prospective cohort study participants (n=4,616). We used mixed models to investigate the effects of occupation and time for: workplace attendance, number of people sharing workspace, time spent sharing workspace, number of close contacts, and usage of face coverings.
Findings
Workplace attendance and contact patterns varied across occupations and time. The predicted probability of intense space sharing during the day was highest for healthcare (78% [95% CI: 75–81%]) and education workers (64% [59%–69%]), who also had the highest probabilities for larger numbers of close contacts (36% [32%–40%] and 38% [33%–43%] respectively). Education workers also demonstrated relatively low predicted probability (51% [44%–57%]) of wearing a face covering during close contact. Across all occupational groups, workspace sharing and close contact increased and usage of face coverings decreased during phases of less stringent restrictions.
Interpretation
Major variations in workplace contact patterns and mask use likely contribute to differential COVID-19 risk. Patterns of variation by occupation and restriction phase may inform interventions for future waves of COVID-19 or other respiratory epidemics. Across occupations, increasing workplace contact and reduced face covering usage is concerning given ongoing high levels of community transmission and emergence of variants.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Background
The worldwide corona virus disease outbreak, generally known as COVID-19 pandemic outbreak resulted in a major health crisis globally. The morbidity and transmission modality of COVID-19 appear more severe and uncontrollable. The respiratory failure and following cardiovascular complications are the main pathophysiology of this deadly disease. Several therapeutic strategies are put forward for the development of safe and effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2 virus from the pharmacological view point but till date there are no specific treatment regimen developed for this viral infection.
Purpose
The present review emphasizes the role of herbs and herbs-derived secondary metabolites in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 virus and also for the management of post-COVID-19 related complications. This approach will foster and ensure the safeguards of using medicinal plant resources to support the healthcare system. Plant-derived phytochemicals have already been reported to prevent the viral infection and to overcome the post-COVID complications like parkinsonism, kidney and heart failure, liver and lungs injury and mental problems. In this review, we explored mechanistic approaches of herbal medicines and their phytocomponenets as antiviral and post-COVID complications by modulating the immunological and inflammatory states.
Study design
Studies related to diagnosis and treatment guidelines issued for COVID-19 by different traditional system of medicine were included. The information was gathered from pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions approaches. The gathered information sorted based on therapeutic application of herbs and their components against SARSCoV-2 and COVID-19 related complications.
Methods
A systemic search of published literature was conducted from 2003 to 2021 using different literature database like Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science to emphasize relevant articles on medicinal plants against SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and Post-COVID related complications.
Results
Collected published literature from 2003 onwards yielded with total 625 articles, from more than 18 countries. Among these 625 articles, more than 95 medicinal plants and 25 active phytomolecules belong to 48 plant families. Reports on the therapeutic activity of the medicinal plants belong to the Lamiaceae family (11 reports), which was found to be maximum reported from 4 different countries including India, China, Australia, and Morocco. Other reports on the medicinal plant of Asteraceae (7 reports), Fabaceae (8 reports), Piperaceae (3 reports), Zingiberaceae (3 reports), Ranunculaceae (3 reports), Meliaceae (4 reports) were found, which can be explored for the development of safe and efficacious products targeting COVID-19.
Conclusion
Keeping in mind that the natural alternatives are in the priority for the management and prevention of the COVID-19, the present review may help to develop an alternative approach for the management of COVID-19 viral infection and post-COVID complications from a mechanistic point of view.

AB  - Vaccine‐induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) has caused global concern. VITT is characterized by thrombosis and thrombocytopenia following COVID‐19 vaccinations with the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCov‐19 and the Janssen Ad26.COV2.S vaccines. Patients present with thrombosis, severe thrombocytopenia developing 5–24 days following first dose of vaccine, with elevated D‐dimer, and PF4 antibodies, signifying platelet activation. As of June 1, 2021, more than 1.93 billion COVID‐19 vaccine doses had been administered worldwide. Currently, 467 VITT cases (0.000024%) have been reported across the UK, Europe, Canada, and Australia. Guidance on diagnosis and management of VITT has been reported but the pathogenic mechanism is yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we propose and discuss potential mechanisms in relation to adenovirus induction of VITT. We provide insights and clues into areas warranting investigation into the mechanistic basis of VITT, highlighting the unanswered questions. Further research is required to help solidify a pathogenic model for this condition.
