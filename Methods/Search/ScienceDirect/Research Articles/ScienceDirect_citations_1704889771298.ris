AB  - COVID-19 vaccinations have been shown to be safe, efficacious, and life-saving. They, like other vaccines, do not entirely protect everyone who receives them, and no one knows how effectively they can prevent people from spreading the virus to others or whether the booster dosage is dangerous to some vulnerable people. So, in addition to getting vaccinated, we must continue with additional efforts to combat the pandemic. Quantitatively, the pragmatic, appropriate, and phenomenal mechanism of the complex spherical fuzzy set enhances the decision-making efficacy and the ordering quality of the ELECTRE I method to include a profitable and optimal approach for MAGDM. In the CSF environment, critically ill patients are investigated systematically using a pairwise comparison based ELECTRE-I technique. In this paper, we improve the precision of the CSF-based ELECTRE-I approach to an unique score function. The suggested approach’s comparability is examined with techniques that should provide equal importance to the alternatives, and the presented score function’s reliability is validated using the existing score function with the two cases.

AB  - Background
The availability of a COVID-19 vaccine has been heralded as key to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 vaccination programme success will rely on public willingness to be vaccinated.
Methods
We used a multi-methods approach - involving an online cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews - to investigate parents’ and guardians’ views on the acceptability of a future COVID-19 vaccine. 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16 + years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey participants were interviewed.
Findings
Most survey participants reported they would likely accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (Definitely 55.8%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 34.3%) and their child/children (Definitely 48.2%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 40.9%). Less than 4% of survey participants reported that they would definitely not accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Survey participants were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves than their child/children. Participants that self-reported as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity were almost 3 times more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children than White British, White Irish and White Other participants. Survey participants from lower-income households were also more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine. In open-text survey responses and interviews, self-protection from COVID-19 was reported as the main reason for vaccine acceptance. Common concerns identified in open-text responses and interviews were around COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, mostly prompted by the newness and rapid development of the vaccine.
Conclusion
Information on how COVID-19 vaccines are developed and tested, including their safety and efficacy, must be communicated clearly to the public. To prevent inequalities in uptake, it is crucial to understand and address factors that may affect COVID-19 vaccine acceptability in ethnic minority and lower-income groups who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

AB  - People who inject drugs (PWID) may have diminished access to essential preventive services like COVID-19 vaccination given structural and substance use barriers. We aimed to assess the role of HIV on COVID-19 vaccination uptake among adult PWID participating in the ALIVE cohort study in Baltimore, Maryland who were alive as of April 2021. We abstracted COVID-19 vaccination data from electronic medical records via the regional health information exchange. We used Kaplan-Meier method to estimate time from universal vaccine eligibility (April 6, 2021) to completion of the COVID-19 vaccination primary series (1 dose J&J or 2 doses mRNA) by HIV viral load status (uninfected, PWH [HIV-RNA < 400 copies/mL], PWH [HIV-RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL]) and Cox Proportional Hazards regression to adjust for potential confounders. Our sample (N = 960) was primarily black (77%) and male (65%) with 31% reporting recent injection drug use. Among 265 (27%) people living with HIV (PWH) in our sample, 84% were virally suppressed. As of February 22, 2022, 539 (56%) completed the primary series, 131 (14%) received a single dose of mRNA vaccine and 290 (30%) remained unvaccinated. Compared to PWID without HIV, virally suppressed PWH were more likely to complete the primary series (Adjusted Hazard Ratio [aHR]:1.23,95% Confidence Interval [95 %CI]:1.07,1.50), while PWH who were not virally suppressed were less likely (aHR:0.72,95 %CI:0.45,1.16), although this was not statistically significant. We conclude that among PWID, HIV infection and viral suppression is associated with quicker vaccination uptake, likely due to HIV care engagement. Targeted improvements along the HIV care continuum may bolster vaccine uptake.

AB  - Official statistics on deaths from COVID undercount deaths due to lack of testing. In developed countries, death registries are used to estimate excess deaths due to COVID during the pandemic. However, few developing countries had complete death registries even before the pandemic and the pandemic further stressed administrative capacities. As a substitute, we estimate all-cause excess deaths in India using the member rosters of a large, representative household panel survey. We estimate roughly 4.2 million excess deaths during the pandemic through February 2022. We cannot demonstrate causality between COVID and deaths, but the timing and age structure of deaths is consistent with the COVID pandemic and excess deaths are positively correlated with reported infections. Finally, we find that excess deaths were higher among higher-income persons and were negatively associated with mobility. The methods in this paper can be used in countries with a household panel to measure health-related demographic indicators.

AB  - Summary
Background
The impact of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections has changed significantly since 2020. However, there is a lack of up-to-date evidence of the epidemiology of these infections which is essential in order to appropriately guide infection control policy.
Aims
To identify the secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated mortality across different variants of concern.
Methods
A single-centre retrospective study of all nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 exposure events was conducted between 31st December 2020 and 31st December 2021. A secondary attack rate was calculated for nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection and time to positivity. Positive contacts were assessed for all-cause 30-day mortality.
Results
A total of 346 sequential index exposure events were examined, and 1378 susceptible contacts identified. Two hundred susceptible contacts developed SARS-CoV-2 infection (secondary attack rate of 15.5%). The majority of index cases (59%) did not result in any secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Where close contacts developed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 80% were detected within the first five days since last contact with the index case. The overall associated mortality among positive contacts across 2021 was 9%, with an estimated reduction of 68% when comparing periods of high Omicron versus Alpha transmission.
Conclusion
Our findings describe that most SARS-CoV-2 infections are detected within five days of contact with an index case; we have also demonstrated a considerably lower mortality rate with the Omicron variant in comparison to previous variants. These findings have important implications for informing and supporting infection control protocols to allow movement through the hospital, and ensure patients access care safely.

AB  - Rates of COVID deaths, hospitalizations, and cases differ markedly across U.S. states, as do rates of vaccination. This study uses cross-state regressions to assess impacts of vaccinations on COVID outcomes. A number of familiar issues arise concerning cross-sectional regressions, including omitted variables, behavioral responses to vaccination, and reverse causation. The benefits from a field context and from the broad range of observed variations suggest the value from dealing with these issues. Results reveal sizable negative effects of vaccination on deaths, hospitalizations, and cases up to early December 2021, although vaccine efficacy seems to wane over time. The findings for deaths apply to all-cause excess mortality as well as COVID-related mortality. The estimates imply that one expected life saved requires 248 additional doses, with a marginal cost around $55000, far below typical estimates of the value of a statistical life. Results since December 2021 suggest smaller effects of vaccinations on deaths and, especially, hospitalizations and cases, possibly because of diminished effectiveness of vaccines against new forms of the virus, notably the omicron variant. A further possibility is that confidence engendered by vaccinations motivated individuals and governments to lessen non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as masking and social distancing.

AB  - The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic influenced the management of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. A paucity of data exists on outcome of patients with vasculitis following COVID-19, but mortality is higher than in the general population and comparable to patients undergoing haemodialysis or kidney transplant recipients (reported mortality rates of 20–25%). Delays in diagnosis have been reported, which are associated with sequelae such as dialysis-dependency. Management of ANCA-associated vasculitis has not changed with the aim to suppress disease activity and reduce burden of disease. The use of rituximab, an important and widely used agent, is associated with a more severe hospital course of COVID-19 and absence of antibodies following severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 infections, which prone patients to re-infection. Reports on vaccine antibody response are scarce at the moment, but preliminary findings point towards an impaired immune response, especially when patients receive rituximab as part of their treatment. Seropositivity was reported in less than 20% of patients when rituximab was administered within the prior six months, and the antibody response correlated with CD19+ B-cell repopulation. A delay in maintenance doses, if disease activity allows, has been suggested using a CD19+ B-cell guided strategy. Other immunosuppressive measures, which are used in ANCA-associated vasculitis, also impair humoral and cellular vaccine responses. Regular measurements of vaccine response or a healthcare-policy time-based strategy are indicated to provide additional doses (“booster”) of COVID-19 vaccines. This review summarizes a recent educational forum and a recent virtual meeting of the European Vasculitis Society (EUVAS) focusing on COVID-19.

We analyze the county COVID-19 mortality rate between February 1 and December 31, 2020 and employ the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method. We estimate the extent to which differences in county characteristics - demographic, socioeconomic, employment, health status, healthcare access, area geography, and Republican vote share, explain the difference in COVID-19 mortality rates in counties governed by Republican vs Democrat governors. Among 3,114 counties, Republican-governed counties had significantly higher COVID-19 mortality than did Democrat-governed counties (127 ± 86 vs 97 ± 80 per 100,000 population, p < 0.001). Results are sensitive to which weights are used: of the total gap of 30.3 deaths per 100,000 population, 12.8 to 20.5 deaths, or 42.2–67.7 %, are explained by differences in observable characteristics of Republican- and Democratic-governed counties. Difference in support for President Trump between Republican- and Democrat-governed counties explains 25 % of the additional deaths in Republican counties. Policies aimed at improving population health and lowering racial disparity in COVID-19 outcomes may also be correlated with reducing the partisan gap in COVID-19 mortality.

AB  - Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality increased during the initial years of the COVID-19 pandemic, but whether these trends endured in 2022 is unknown. This analysis describes temporal trends in CVD death rates from 2010 to 2022 and estimates excess CVD deaths from 2020 to 2022.
Methods
Using national mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System, deaths among adults aged ≥35 years were classified by underlying cause of death International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision codes for CVD (I00–I99), heart disease (I00–I09, I11, I13, I20–I51), and stroke (I60–I69). Analyses in Joinpoint software identified trends in CVD age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) per 100,000 and estimated the number of excess CVD deaths from 2020 to 2022.
Results
During 2010–2022, 10,951,403 CVD deaths occurred (75.6% heart disease, 16.9% stroke). The national CVD AAMR declined by 8.9% from 2010 to 2019 (456.6–416.0 per 100,000) and then increased by 9.3% from 2019 to 2022 to 454.5 per 100,000, which approximated the 2010 rate (456.7 per 100,000). From 2020 to 2022, 228,524 excess CVD deaths occurred, which was 9% more CVD deaths than expected based on trends from 2010 to 2019. Results varied by CVD subtype and population subgroup.
Conclusions
Despite stabilization of the public health emergency, declines in CVD mortality rates reversed in 2020 and remained high in 2022, representing almost a decade of lost progress and over 228,000 excess CVD deaths. Findings underscore the importance of prioritizing prevention and management of CVD to improve outcomes.

AB  - This study proposes a decision support system (DSS) that integrates GIS, analytics, and simulation methods to help develop a priority-based distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in a large urban setting. The methodology applies novel hierarchical heuristic-simulation procedures to create a holistic algorithm for prioritising the process of demand allocation and optimising vaccine distribution. The Melbourne metropolitan area in Australia with a population of over five million is used as a case study. Three vaccine supply scenarios, namely limited, excessive, and disruption, were formulated to operationalise a two-dose vaccination program. Vaccine distribution with hard constraints were simulated and then further validated with sensitivity analyses. The results show that vaccines can be prioritised to society’s most vulnerable segments and distributed using the current logistics network with 10 vehicles. Compared with other vaccine distribution plans with no prioritisation, such as equal allocation of vaccines to local government areas based on population size or one on a first-come-first-serve basis, the plans generated by the proposed DSS ensure prioritised vaccination of the most needed and vulnerable population. The aim is to curb the spread of the infection and reduce mortality rate more effectively. They also achieve vaccination of the entire population with less logistical resources required. As such, this study contributes to knowledge and practice in pandemic vaccine distribution and enables governments to make real-time decisions and adjustments in daily distribution plans. In this way any unforeseen disruptions in the vaccine supply chain can be coped with.

AB  - Post COVID-19 vaccine development, nations are now getting ready to face another challenge: how to effectively distribute vaccines amongst the masses to quickly achieve herd immunity against the infection. According to some experts, herd immunity for COVID-19 can be achieved by inoculating 67% of the population. India may find it difficult to achieve this service level target, owing to several infrastructural deficiencies in its vaccine supply chain. Effect of these deficiencies is to cause frequent lead time disruptions. In this context, we develop a novel modelling approach to identify few nodes, which require additional inventory allocations (strategic inventory reserves) to ensure minimum service level (67%) under the possibility of lead time disruptions. Later, through an illustrative case study on distribution of Japanese Encephalitis vaccine, we identify conditions under which strategic inventory reserve policy cannot be practically implemented to meet service level targets. Nodes fulfilling these conditions are termed as critical nodes and must be overhauled structurally to make the implementation of strategic inventory policy practically viable again. Structural overhauling may entail installation of better cold storage facilities, purchasing more quality transport vans, improving reliability of transport network, and skills of cold storage manager by training. Ideally, conditions for identifying critical nodes for COVID-19 vaccine distribution must be derived separately by substituting COVID-19 specific parametric values in our model. In the absence of the required data for COVID-19 scenario, JE specific criteria can be used heuristically to identify critical nodes and structurally overhaul them later for efficiently achieving service level targets.

AB  - The Delta-Omicron wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (Wave 4) in the United States occurred in Fall of 2021 through Spring of 2022. Although vaccinations were widely available, this was the deadliest period to date in the U.S., and the toll was especially high in rural areas, exacerbating an existing rural mortality penalty. This paper uses county-level multilevel regression models and publicly available data for 47 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. We describe differences in COVID-19 case and mortality rates across the rural-urban continuum during Wave 4 of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a progressive modeling approach, we evaluate the relative contribution of a range of explanatory factors for the rural disadvantage we observe, including: pre-pandemic population health composition, vaccination rates, political partisanship, socioeconomic composition, access to broadband internet rate, and primary care physicians per capita. Results show that rural counties had higher observed burdens of cases and deaths in Wave 4 compared to more urban counties. The most remote rural counties had Wave 4 COVID-19 mortality rates 52% higher than the most urban counties. Older age composition, worse pre-pandemic population health, lower vaccination rates, higher share of votes cast for Donald Trump in the 2020 Presidential election, and lower socioeconomic composition completely explained the rural disadvantage in reported COVID-19 case rates in Wave 4, and accounting for these factors reversed the observed rural disadvantage in COVID-19 mortality. In models of mortality rate, Trump vote share had the largest effect size, followed by the percentage of the population age 50 or older, the poverty rate, the pre-pandemic mortality rate, the share of residents with a 4-year college degree, and the vaccination rate. These findings add to a growing literature describing the disproportionate toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural America, highlighting the combined effect of multiple sources of rural disadvantage.

AB  - Summary
Background
COVID-19 has worse mortality than influenza in American and European studies, but evidence from the Western Pacific region is scarce.
Methods
Using a large-scale multicenter inpatient claims data in Japan, we identified individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 in 2020 or influenza in 2017–2020. We compared patient characteristics, supportive care, and in-hospital mortality, with multivariable logistic regression analyses for in-hospital mortality overall, by age group, and among patients with mechanical ventilation.
Findings
We identified 16,790 COVID-19 patients and 27,870 influenza patients, with the different age distribution (peak at 70–89 years in COVID-19 vs. bimodal peaks at 0–9 and 80–89 years in influenza). On admission, the use of mechanical ventilation was similar in both groups (1·4% vs. 1·4%) but higher in the COVID-19 group (3·3% vs. 2·5%; p<0·0001) during the entire hospitalisation. The crude in-hospital mortality was 5·1% (856/16,790) for COVID-19 and 2·8% (791/27,870) for influenza. Adjusted for potential confounders, the in-hospital mortality was higher for COVID-19 than for influenza (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1·64–2·04). In age-stratified analyses, the aOR (95%CI) were 0·78 (0·56–1·08) and 2·05 (1·83–2·30) in patients aged 20–69 years and ≥70 years, respectively (p-for-interaction<0·0001). Among patients with mechanical ventilation, the aOR was 0·79 (0·59–1·05).
Interpretation
Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Japan were more likely to die than those with influenza. However, this was mainly driven by findings in older people, and there was no difference once mechanical ventilation was started.

AB  - Background
There are few studies demonstrating how the effectiveness of various extents of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) before and after vaccination periods. The study aimed to demonstrate such an effectiveness in the alteration of the epidemic curves from theory to practice.
Methods
The empirical data on the daily reported COVID-19 cases were extracted from open source. A computer simulation design in conjunction with the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) type model was applied to evaluating confinement measures in Italy with adjustment for underreported cases; isolation and quarantine in Taiwan; and NPIs and vaccination in Israel.
Results
In Italy scenario, the extents of confinement measures were 34% before the end of March and then scaled up to 70% after then. Both figures were reduced to 22–69% after adjusting for underreported cases. Approximately 44% of confinement measures were implemented in the second surge of pandemic in Italy. Fitting the observational data on Taiwan assuming the initial outbreak similar to Wuhan, China, 44% of isolation and quarantine were estimated before March 23rd, 2020. Isolation and quarantine were scaled up to 90% and at least 60% to contain community-acquired outbreaks from March 24th, 2020 onwards. Given 15% monthly vaccination rate from December 2020 in Israel, the effectiveness estimates of reducing the infected toll were 36%, 56%, and 85% for NPIs alone, vaccination alone, and both combined, respectively.
Conclusion
We demonstrated how various NPIs stamp out and delay the epidemic curve of COVID-19. The optimal implementation of these NPIs has to be planned before wide vaccine uptake worldwide.

KW  - Cross-sectional study
AB  - Background
Equity in vaccination against COVID-19 is a public health concern. The objective of this study was to analyze socioeconomic inequalities related to vaccination for the first and second doses from primary series against COVID-19 in Ecuador.
Methods
Secondary database study in 12,743,507 respondents from 15 years and over. The COVID-19 section of the National Survey of Employment, Unemployment and Underemployment (ENEMDU) was analyzed. Socioeconomic characteristics and vaccination against COVID-19 were associated with the at least one dose and second dose. Poisson regressions for complex samples were obtained.
Results
As of the date of the survey, 87.3% of the sample (95% CI 86.7%-87.8%) had received at least one vaccine against COVID-19. A lower probability of having received at least one vaccine against COVID-19 was found in rural areas (PR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74–0.91), indigenous population (PR 0.43, 95% CI 0.29–0.64), no level of education (PR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14–0.43), and the lowest economic income (PR 0.42, 95% CI 0.35–0.52). A significantly lower probability of vaccination with two or more doses was found in rural vs urban area (PR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80–0.96), women vs men (PR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77–0.91), indigenous population vs white (PR 0.44, 95% CI 0.33–0.59) and individuals in the lowest income quartile vs highest income quartile (PR 0.48, 95% CI 0.42–0.55). Underemployment, population economically inactive (PR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67–0.88 and PR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61–0.83) and individuals with no level of education (PR 0.39, 95% CI 0.27–0.58) also were less likely to complete the primary phase of vaccination compared with individuals in the highest income quartile, employment and postgraduate level of education.
Conclusions
There were socioeconomic inequalities with the primary series of vaccine against COVID-19, with a greater disadvantage for rural residents, women, indigenous populations, lower economic income and lower levels of education.

AB  - The unprecedented coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has wreaked havoc across the globe. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected all countries, including government intervention programs, thus becoming a significant threat. This study aims to develop a hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (F-MCDM) model in a constrained ecosystem in response to specific government strategies and the effectiveness of interventions used in different countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. An empirical case study is conducted in India with five prospective criteria: “high acceptance among the populace”, “effectiveness in halting the COVID-19 epidemic”, “compatibility by any other standard”, “estimated total cost”, and “simple to implement”. Regarding the ranking of strategies, “vaccinations”, “social isolation”, and “development of an emergence” are the top three strategies. As a result, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have reduced COVID-19-related hospitalizations in the elderly, which has reduced post-CoVID morbidity and mortality. Many countries have different recommendations for selecting possible government initiatives and implementing those decisions. India’s strategies for developing public health policies, preventing misinformation, and managing behavior and response were ranked as the top three priorities among the listed strategies. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the validity of these results. In this work, the implications of these findings are discussed in terms of a developing nation.

AB  - This communication provides a compilation on aspects of COVID-19 infection control measures, describes the potential role of therapeutic plasma exchange to reduce fatality rates, addresses precautions concerning dexamethasone pharmacotherapy and updates the current status on the availability of vaccines. As part of passive immunotherapy, it focuses on various blood derivatives. These include coronavirus neutralising antibodies extracted from different sources to be administered as a pure hyper concentrate intramuscularly or for upgrading and standardising the specific potency of high affinity antibodies. These processes are intended to compose standardised pooled bioproducts of corona convalescent plasma/cryosupernatant that are pathogen inactivated for additional safety by well-established UV technologies. For the best practice of optimising plasma exchange, hyper concentrate NAb should be added to the cryosupernatant, which contains some of the active principles of corona convalescent plasma. The cryosupernatant apart from the high molecular weight viscous part of cold insoluble proteins that are removed, is equivalent to CCP, but makes it safer for general application. Such a bioproduct is often used routinely for substitution therapy of thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura. Alternative resources of large-scale specific coronavirus antibodies warrant further exploration such as cadaveric donations. The early uses of therapeutic plasma exchange and low molecular weight heparin, for any clinical trial in development is warranted, in order to interdict the intense inflammatory/kinin driven cascade. Because coronavirus positive patients are highly prone to thrombosis, thromboprophylaxis is necessary, even some time after recovery guided by the laboratory data.

AB  - Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented global challenges in the health, economy, society, and political sector for the past three years. For the Netherlands, the dynamic nature of the pandemic can be divided into three phases. The initial phase exclusively relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The second phase was characterized by the introduction of vaccines alongside the continuation of stringent NPIs. Finally, the third phase marks the post-vaccine and booster stage, characterized by minimal or absent NPIs. This paper examines the interplay between the mitigation policies, the vaccination rollout, health outcomes, and economic indicators in the Netherlands in these three phases.
Methods
This analysis used national real-time data on COVID-19-related health outcomes, health service utilization, vaccination rollout, and economic indicators. Our descriptive analysis applied the “Categorising Policy & Technology Interventions (CPTI)” framework.
Results
The number of daily deaths, hospital admission and ICU admission experienced the highest peak in the first phase, while the number of daily cases first spiked in the third phase. The containment measures reached a very significant level twice, resulting in a full lockdown twice. In the first two phases, the peak in stringency of the CPTI containment category was parallel with the peaks in health outcomes. Conversely, in the third phase, the containment measures were scaled down prior to the peak in daily cases.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that the Dutch three-phased COVID-19 mitigation strategy managed to fulfil its aim and protect vulnerable individuals, prevent healthcare institutions from overload, and move from the pandemic to the endemic phase.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus was identified in China in 2019 as the causative agent of COVID-19, and quickly spread throughout the world, causing over 7 million deaths, of which 2 million occurred prior to the introduction of the first vaccine. In the following discussion, while recognising that complement is just one of many players in COVID-19, we focus on the relationship between complement and COVID-19 disease, with limited digression into directly-related areas such as the relationship between complement, kinin release, and coagulation. Prior to the 2019 COVID-19 outbreak, an important role for complement in coronavirus diseases had been established. Subsequently, multiple investigations of patients with COVID-19 confirmed that complement dysregulation is likely to be a major driver of disease pathology, in some, if not all, patients. These data fuelled evaluation of many complement-directed therapeutic agents in small patient cohorts, with claims of significant beneficial effect. As yet, these early results have not been reflected in larger clinical trials, posing questions such as who to treat, appropriate time to treat, duration of treatment, and optimal target for treatment. While significant control of the pandemic has been achieved through a global scientific and medical effort to comprehend the etiology of the disease, through extensive SARS-CoV-2 testing and quarantine measures, through vaccine development, and through improved therapy, possibly aided by attenuation of the dominant strains, it is not yet over. In this review, we summarise complement-relevant literature, emphasise its main conclusions, and formulate a hypothesis for complement involvement in COVID-19. Based on this we make suggestions as to how any future outbreak might be better managed in order to minimise impact on patients.

AB  - Summary
Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections of vaccinated individuals are being reported globally, resulting in an increased risk of hospitalization and death among such patients. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the modifiable risk factors that may affect the protective efficacy of vaccine use against the development of severe COVID-19 and thus to initiate early medical interventions. Here, in population-based studies using the UK Biobank database and the 2021 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), we analyzed 20,362 participants aged 50 years or older and 2,588 aged 18 years or older from both databases who tested positive for SARS-COV-2, of whom 33.1% and 67.7% received one or more doses of vaccine, respectively. In the UK Biobank, participants are followed from the vaccination date until October 18, 2021. We found that obesity and metabolic abnormalities (namely, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension) were modifiable factors for severe COVID-19 in vaccinated patients (all p < 0.05). When metabolic abnormalities were present, regardless of obesity, the risk of severe COVID-19 was higher than that of metabolically normal individuals (all p < 0.05). Moreover, pharmacological interventions targeting such abnormalities (namely, antihypertensive [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.48–0.86; p = 0.003], glucose-lowering [aHR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36–0.83; p = 0.004], and lipid-lowering treatments [aHR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37–0.68; p < 0.001]) were significantly associated with a reduced risk for this outcome. These results show that more proactive health management of patients with obesity and metabolic abnormalities is critical to reduce the incidence of severe COVID-19 after vaccination.

AB  - COVID-19 has had a calamitous effect on the global community. Despite intense study, the immunologic response to the infection is only partially understood. In addition to older age and ethnicity, patients with comorbidities including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, malignancy, renal, and pulmonary disease may experience severe outcomes. Some patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) and secondary immunodeficiency also appear to be at increased risk from COVID-19. In addition to vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2, patients with PIDs often have chronic pulmonary disease and may not respond to vaccines, which exacerbates their long-term risk. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders, the most frequent symptomatic PID in adults and children, have a spectrum of B- and T-cell defects. It may be possible to stratify their risk for severe COVID-19 based on age, ethnicity, the severity of the T-cell defect, and the presence of other comorbidities. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders and other immunodeficiencies are at risk for Chronic COVID-19, a dangerous stalemate between a suboptimal immune response and SARS-CoV-2. Intra-host viral evolution could result in the rapid emergence of vaccine-resistant mutants and variants of high consequence; it is a public health emergency. Vaccination and prevention of Chronic COVID-19 in immunodeficient patients is therefore of the utmost priority. Having a reliable diagnostic assay for T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for evaluating responses to vaccines in these patients. New treatments for SARS-CoV-2 such as NZACE2-Pātari are likely to be particularly beneficial for immunodeficient patients, especially those who fail to mount a robust T-cell response to COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - Abstract
Objectives
SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic, with little prevention or treatment options. More than 600 million mortalities have been documented from SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the majority of fatalities occurring among elderly patients (aged >65 years). A number of vaccines have been developed in an effort to restrain the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the widespread administration of these vaccines, substantial side or undesired effects in multiple organ systems have emerged, necessitating essential critical care. Herein, we tabulate the adverse cardiovascular responses resulting from COVID-19 vaccines.
Design or Methods
We searched PubMed for articles published through April, 2022, with the terms “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “cardiovascular”, “SARS-CoV-2 vaccines”, “COVID-19 vaccines”, “myocarditis”, “pericarditis”, “thrombosis”, “thrombocytopenia”, “vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia”, “acute coronary syndrome”, “myocardial infarction”, “hypertension”, “arrythmia”, “postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome”, “Takotsubo cardiomyopathy”, “cardiac arrest” and “death”. We mainly selected publications from the past 3 years, but did not exclude widely referenced and highly regarded older publications. Besides, we searched the reference lists of articles identified by above search method and chose those we considered relevant.
Results
COVID-19 vaccines evoke rare but fatal thrombotic events, whereas messenger RNA\055based vaccines appear to be associated with risks of pericarditis/myocarditis, with the latter being more predominant in young adults following the second dose. Reports of other cardiovascular responses, including hypertension, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, and cardiac arrest, have also been indicated.
Conclusion
The undesired cardiovascular complications remain infrequent, giveng the large number of vaccinations inoculated to general population. And lower mortality takes precedence over the undesired cardiovascular complications.

AB  - Summary
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted health systems globally. We estimated the effect of the pandemic on the coverage and timeliness of routine childhood immunization in India through April 2021.
Methods
We used data from India's National Family Health Survey 2019–2021 (NFHS-5), a cross-sectional survey which collected immunization information of under-five children from a nationally representative sample of households between June 2019 and April 2021. We used a mother fixed-effects regression model – accounting for secular trends and confounding factors – to compare COVID-affected children with their COVID-unaffected siblings (n = 59,144). Children who were eligible for a vaccine after January 30, 2020 (date of the first COVID case in India) were considered as the COVID-affected group and those eligible for a vaccine before this date were included in the COVID-unaffected group. Coverage of the following vaccine doses was considered—Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), hepatitis B birth dose (hepB0), DPT1 (diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, first dose), DPT2, DPT3, polio1, polio2, polio3, and measles first dose (MCV1). Indicators of vaccine coverage and vaccine timeliness (defined as receiving a dose within 45 days of minimum eligibility age) were separately examined.
Findings
Immunization coverage was lower in COVID-affected children as compared with unaffected children, ranging from 2% lower for BCG and hepB0 to 9% for DPT3 and 10% for polio3. There was no significant difference in MCV1 coverage. Coverage reduction was greater for vaccines doses given in later age groups. The rate of timely receipt of polio and DPT vaccine doses was 3%–5% lower among COVID-affected children relative to unaffected children. Among population subgroups, COVID-affected male children and those from rural areas experienced the highest reduction in vaccine coverage.
Interpretation
Children in India experienced lower routine immunization coverage and greater delays in immunization during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Objectives
This study analysed the association between social and ideological determinants with COVID-19 vaccine accessibility and hesitancy in the Spanish adult population.
Study design
This was a repeated cross-sectional study.
Methods
The data analysed are based on monthly surveys conducted by the Centre for Sociological Research between May 2021 and February 2022. Individuals were classified according to their COVID-19 vaccination status into (1) vaccinated (reference group); (2) willing to vaccinate but not vaccinated, proxy of lack of vaccine accessibility; and (3) hesitant, proxy of vaccine hesitancy. Independent variables included social (educational attainment, gender) and ideological determinants (voting in the last elections, importance attached to the health vs the economic impact of the pandemic, and political self-placement). We estimated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) conducting one age-adjusted multinomial logistic regression model for each determinant and then stratified them by gender.
Results
Both social and ideological determinants had a weak association with the lack of vaccine accessibility. Individuals with medium educational attainment had higher odds of vaccine hesitancy (OR = 1.44, CI 1.08–1.93) compared with those with high educational attainment. People self-identified as conservative (OR = 2.90; CI 2.02–4.15) and those who prioritised the economic impact (OR = 3.80; CI 2.62–5.49) and voted for parties opposed to the Government (OR = 2.00; CI 1.54–2.60) showed higher vaccine hesitancy. The stratified analysis showed a similar pattern for both men and women.
Conclusions
Considering the determinants of vaccine uptake and hesitancy could help to design strategies that increase immunisation at the population level and minimise health inequities.

AB  - Background
Persons with COVID-19 infection have an increased risk of pregnancy-related complications. However, data on acute cardiovascular (CV) complications during delivery admissions remain limited.
Objectives
The purpose of this study was to determine whether pregnant individuals with COVID-19 have an increased risk of acute peripartum CV complications during their delivery admission.
Methods
This population-based retrospective cohort study used the 2020 National Inpatient Sample database. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes were used to identify delivery admissions with a diagnosis of COVID-19. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to determine the association between COVID-19 and acute peripartum CV complications at delivery.
Results
A total of 3,458,691 weighted delivery admissions were identified, of which 1.3% were among persons with COVID-19 (n = 46,375). Persons with COVID-19 were younger (median 28 vs 29 years, P < 0.01) and had a higher prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm births, and Cesarean delivery (P < 0.01). After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, insurance, and income, COVID-19 remained independently associated with peripartum CV complications including preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.33 [95% CI, 1.29-1.37]), peripartum cardiomyopathy (aOR: 2.09 [1.54-2.84]), acute coronary syndrome (aOR: 12.94 [8.85-18.90]), and arrhythmias (aOR: 1.55 [1.45-1.67]), compared with no COVID-19. Likewise, the risks of in-hospital mortality, acute kidney injury, stroke, pulmonary edema, and venous thromboembolism were higher with COVID-19. For resource utilization, the cost of hospitalization ($5,374 vs $4,837, P < 0.01) was higher for deliveries among persons with COVID-19.
Conclusions
In the year 2020, pregnant persons with COVID-19 had a higher risk of preeclampsia, in-hospital mortality, and other serious CV complication during delivery hospitalizations compared to pregnant individuals without COVID-19.

AB  - There is a marked variation in mortality risk associated with COVID-19 infection in the general population. Low socioeconomic status and other social determinants have been discussed as possible causes for the higher burden in African American communities compared with white communities. Beyond the social determinants, the biochemical mechanism that predisposes individual subjects or communities to the development of excess and serious complications associated with COVID-19 infection is not clear. Virus infection triggers massive ROS production and oxidative damage. Glutathione (GSH) is essential and protects the body from the harmful effects of oxidative damage from excess reactive oxygen radicals. GSH is also required to maintain the VD-metabolism genes and circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)VD). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is necessary to prevent the exhaustion and depletion of cellular GSH. X-linked genetic G6PD deficiency is common in the AA population and predominantly in males. Acquired deficiency of G6PD has been widely reported in subjects with conditions of obesity and diabetes. This suggests that individuals with G6PD deficiency are vulnerable to excess oxidative stress and at a higher risk for inadequacy or deficiency of 25(OH)VD, leaving the body unable to protect its ‘oxidative immune-metabolic’ physiological functions from the insults of COVID-19. An association between subclinical interstitial lung disease with 25(OH)VD deficiencies and GSH deficiencies has been previously reported. We hypothesize that the overproduction of ROS and excess oxidative damage is responsible for the impaired immunity, secretion of the cytokine storm, and onset of pulmonary dysfunction in response to the COVID-19 infection. The co-optimization of impaired glutathione redox status and excess 25(OH)VD deficiencies has the potential to reduce oxidative stress, boost immunity, and reduce the adverse clinical effects of COVID-19 infection in the AA population.

AB  - This paper investigated the spatiotemporal pattern of COVID-19 mortality and its socioeconomic and environmental determinants in the first and second wave of the pandemic in England. The COVID-19 mortality rates for middle super output areas from March 2020 to April 2021 were used in the analysis. SaTScan was used in the analysis of spatiotemporal pattern of COVID-19 mortality and geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) was used to investigate the association with socioeconomic and environmental factors. The results show that there was significant spatiotemporal variation in hotspots of COVID-19 deaths with the hotspots moving from regions where the COVID-19 outbreak initiated and then spread to other parts of the country. The GWPR analysis revealed that age composition, ethnic composition, deprivation, care home and pollution were all related to COVID-19 mortality. Althoughthe relationship varied over space the association with these factors was fairly consistent over the first and second wave.

AB  - Purpose
Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) are considered particularly susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV2 on the basis of the immunodeficiency associated with advanced age, comorbidity burden, medication use, and need for frequent visits to dialysis clinics. In prior studies, thymalfasin (thymosin alpha 1, Ta1) has been shown to enhance antibody response to influenza vaccine and reduce influenza infection in geriatric populations, including hemodialysis patients, when used as an adjunct to influenza vaccine. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic we speculated that administration of Ta1 to HD patients would result in reduced rate and severity of COVID-19 infection. We also hypothesized that HD patients treated with Ta1 who did become infected with COVID-19 would have a milder course of infection in terms of hospitalization rates, requirement for and length of ICU stays, requirement for mechanical ventilation, and survival. Further, we proposed that patients who avoided COVID-19 infection during the study would have decreased non-COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations compared to controls.
Procedures
The study launched in January 2021 and, as of July 1, 2022, 254 ESRD/ HD patients from five dialysis centers in Kansas City, MO have been screened. Of these, 194 patients have been randomized 1:1 to either Group A (1.6 mg Ta1 given subcutaneously twice weekly for 8 weeks), or Group B (control group not receiving Ta1). After the 8-week treatment period, subjects were followed for an additional 4 months and monitored for safety and efficacy. A data safely monitoring board reviewed all reported adverse effects and commented on study progress.
Results
To date, only 3 deaths have occurred in subjects treated with Ta1 (Group A), compared to 7 in the control (Group B). There have been 12 COVID-19 related serious adverse effects (SAEs; 5 in Group A, and 7 in Group B). The majority of patients have received a COVID-19 vaccine (91 patients in group A, and 76 patients in Group B) at various times throughout the study. Nearing completion of the study, blood samples have been collected and antibody responses to COVID-19 will be analyzed along with safety and efficacy endpoints when all subjects have completed the study.

AB  - Summary
Objective
Prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, influenza was the most frequent cause of viral respiratory pneumonia requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Few studies have compared the characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and influenza.
Methods
This was a French nationwide study comparing COVID-19 (March 1, 2020–June 30, 2021) and influenza patients (January 1, 2014–December 31, 2019) admitted to an ICU during pre-vaccination era. Primary outcome was in-hospital death. Secondary outcome was need for mechanical ventilation.
Results
105,979 COVID-19 patients were compared to 18,763 influenza patients. Critically ill patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be men with more comorbidities. Patients with influenza required more invasive mechanical ventilation (47 vs. 34%, p < 0·001), vasopressors (40% vs. 27, p < 0·001) and renal-replacement therapy (22 vs. 7%, p < 0·001). Hospital mortality was 25% and 21% (p < 0·001) in patients with COVID-19 and influenza, respectively. In the subgroup of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay was significantly longer in patients with COVID-19 (18 [10–32] vs. 15 [8–26] days, p < 0·001). Adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, and modified SAPS II score, in-hospital death was higher in COVID-19 patients (adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio [aSHR]=1.69; 95%CI=1.63–1.75) compared with influenza patients. COVID-19 was also associated with less invasive mechanical ventilation (aSHR=0.87; 95%CI=0.85–0.89) and a higher likelihood of death without invasive mechanical ventilation (aSHR=2.40; 95%CI=2.24–2.57).
Conclusion
Despite younger age and lower SAPS II score, critically ill COVID-19 patients had a longer hospital stay and higher mortality than patients with influenza.

AB  - Public experiences of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown differed dramatically between countries and socio-economic groups. Low-income countries raise unique empirical and ethical concerns about (1) the balance between benefits and social harms and (2) how explanatory disease models and everyday life realities influenced the experience and interpretation of lockdown itself. In this paper, we present qualitative data on community perceptions and experiences of the pandemic from a remote area of Haiti, with a focus on the 2020 lockdown. We conducted in-depth interviews with 30 community leaders in Grand’Anse Department, southwest Haiti, at two time periods: May 2020 and October–December 2021. We divide our results into five sections. First, our analysis showed that lockdown was widely considered ineffective at controlling COVID-19. Despite the lack of testing, community leaders believed most of the local population had caught COVID-19 in the first half of 2020, with limited reported mortality. Public concern about the pandemic largely ended at this time, overtaken by other socio-economic and political crises. Second, we found that popular explanations for the low fatality rate were related to various coping strategies: the strength of people's immune systems, use of natural prophylactic folk teas, beliefs about the virus, spiritual protections and the tropical weather. Third, we found that lockdown was widely seen to have not been appropriate for the Haitian context due to various challenges with compliance in the face of socio-economic vulnerability. Fourth, we found strong negative feelings about the social consequences of lockdown measures, which lasted from March–August 2020, including adverse effects on: food security, household income, education, health, and psychosocial well-being. Finally, these perceptions and experiences reinforced popular ideas that lockdown had been imposed by elites for financial and/or political gain, something that was also reflected in the discourse about the low vaccine acceptance rate. Our study showed that pandemic respiratory virus response in Haiti should better balance restrictive non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) with existing socio-economic vulnerability. Local socio-behavioral dynamics and risk perceptions decrease the overall effectiveness of NPIs in fragile states and alternatives to lockdown, such as shielding the most vulnerable, are likely to be a more appropriate strategy.

AB  - Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has a great impact on solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients due to their comorbidities and their maintenance immunosuppression. So far, studies about the different aspects of the impact of the pandemic on SOT recipients are limited.
Objectives
This systematic review summarizes the risk factors that make SOT patients more vulnerable for severe COVID-19 disease or mortality and the impact of immunosuppressive therapy. Furthermore, their clinical outcomes, mortality risk, immunosuppression, immunity and COVID-19 vaccination efficacy are discussed.
Methods
A systematic search on PubMed was performed to select original articles on SOT recipients concerning the following four topics: (1) mortality and clinical course; (2) risk factors for mortality and composite outcomes; (3) maintenance immunosuppression; (4) immunity to COVID-19 infection and (5) vaccine immunogenicity. Relevant data were extracted, analyzed and summarized in tables.
Results
This systematic review includes 77 articles. Mortality was associated with advanced age. Post-transplantation time or comorbidities were variably identified as independent risk factors for mortality or severe disease. However, generally, no comorbidity was reported as a major risk factor. SOT recipients have a higher risk of acute kidney injury, but no higher rate of mortality compared to non-transplanted patients was found. Immunosuppression was individually adjusted, without leading to high rates of graft dysfunction. Generally, no association between type of immunosuppression and mortality was found. SOT patients established humoral and cellular immune responses after COVID-19 disease comparable to immunocompetent people. At last, SOT patients experience a diminished immune response after two-dose vaccination with SARS-COV-2-mRNA-vaccines.
Conclusion
More research is needed to address the direct effect of COVID-19 disease on the graft in lung transplant recipients, as well as the factors ameliorating the immune response in SOT recipients.

AB  - Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines might have increased the incidence of giant-cell arteritis (GCA) and the risk of associated stroke in Spain.
Methods
Retrospective nation-wide observational analysis of all adults hospitalized with GCA in Spain during 5 years (Jan-2016 and Dec-2021). The incidence and proportion of admissions with or because of GCA and GCA-associated stroke were compared between pre-pandemic (2016–2019) and pandemic (2020 and 2021) years. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the different COVID-19 waves and vaccine timing schedules.
Results
A total of 17,268 hospital admissions in patients diagnosed with GCA were identified. During 2020 there were 79.3 and 8.1 per 100,000 admissions of GCA and GCA-associated stroke, respectively. During 2021 these figures were 80.8 and 7.7 per 100,00 admissions, respectively. As comparison, yearly admissions due to GCA and GCA-associated stroke were 72.4 and 5.7 per 100,00, respectively, during the pre-pandemic period (p < 0.05). Coincident with the third wave of COVID-19 (and first vaccine dosing), the rate of GCA-associated stroke admissions increased significantly (from 6.7 to 12%; p < 0.001). Likewise, there was an increase in GCA-associated stroke (6.6% vs 4.1%, p = 0.016) coincident with the third dose vaccination (booster) in patients older than 70 at the end of 2021. In multivariate analysis, only patients admitted during the third COVID-19 wave (and first vaccine dosing) (OR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.22–2.93), and during the third vaccination dosing in patients older than 70 (booster) (OR = 1.66, CI 1.11–2.49), presented a higher GCA-associated stroke risk than the same months of previous years after adjustment by age, sex, classical cardiovascular risk factors and COVID-19 diagnosis.
Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increased incidence of GCA during 2020 and 2021. Moreover, the risk of associated stroke significantly risen accompanying times of COVID-19 vaccine dosing, hypothetically linked to an increased thrombotic risk of mRNA-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Hence, forthcoming vaccine policies and indications must weigh the risk of severe COVID-19 with the risk of flare or stroke in patients with GCA.

AB  - Older adults in nursing homes are at greatest risk of morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nursing home residents constituted one-third to more than half of all deaths during the early waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following this, widespread adaptation of infection prevention and control measures and the supply and use of personal protective equipment resulted in a significant decrease in nursing home infections and deaths. For nursing homes, the most important determinant of experiencing a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the first instance appears to be community-transmission levels (particularly with variants of concern), although nursing home size and quality, for-profit status, and sociodemographic characteristics are also important. Use of visitation bans, imposed to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on residents, must be delicately balanced against their impact on resident, friend or family, and staff well-being. The successful rollout of primary vaccination has resulted in a sharp decrease in morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes. However, emerging evidence suggests that vaccine efficacy may wane over time, and the use of a third or additional vaccine “booster” doses in nursing home residents restores protection afforded by primary vaccination. Ongoing monitoring of vaccine efficacy in terms of infection, morbidity, and mortality is crucial in this vulnerable group in informing ongoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine boosting strategies. Here, we detail the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on nursing home residents and discuss important considerations in the management of nursing home SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. We additionally examine the use of testing strategies, nonpharmacologic outbreak control measures and vaccination strategies in this cohort. Finally, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the sector is reflected on as we emphasize the need for adoption of universal standards of medical care and integration with wider public health infrastructure in nursing homes in order to provide a safe and effective long-term care sector.

AB  - Objective
To compare the mortality risk due to covid-19 with death due to overdose in British Columbia, Canada. The opioid epidemic was declared a public health emergency in 2016.
Methods
Mortality risk was calculated in micromorts with covid-19 data for January–October 2020, derived from the BC center for Disease Control, and illicit drug toxicity deaths for January 2010–September 2020, derived from the BC Coroners Service. Age-stratified covid-19 incidence and deaths per 100,000 population and age-stratified illicit drug toxicity death rates per 100,000 population were calculated. A micromort is a unit of risk equivalent to a one-in-a-million chance of death.
Results
During the covid-19 pandemic, illicit drug toxicity deaths reached 1.0 micromorts per day, representing an increase of 0.5 micromorts per day relative to 2019 rates. In comparison, covid-19 mortality risk was 0.05 micromorts per day among individuals from the general population living in British Columbia and 21.1 micromorts per day among those infected with covid-19. Covid-related mortality risk was significantly lower among individuals aged <60 years, relative to older adults, whereas drug toxicity-related mortality was highest for individuals aged 30–59 years.
Conclusions
The mortality associated with covid-19 is apparent and distributed unevenly across subpopulations. The mortality due to overdose has increased during covid-19 and exceeds mortality due to covid-19. Our results instantiate the triple threat caused by covid-19 (i.e., public health crisis, economic crisis and mental health crisis) and quantitatively highlight the externality of increased mortality due to deaths of despair in response to public health efforts to reduce covid-related mortality.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has now killed 1 of every 303 Americans. Whereas 4 vaccines are approved in the United States and masks are widely available, too few are fully immunized and most of the population has stopped wearing protective masks. The ongoing consequences of this include continued excess morbidity and mortality and the generation of immune-evading variants and subvariants, which in toto are injurious and ultimately self-defeating. Herein we briefly update and review COVID-19 vaccines, waning immunity, and new variants.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Objectives
Underlying immunodeficiency has been associated with worse clinical presentation and increased mortality in patients with COVID-19. We evaluated the mortality of solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients (SOTR) hospitalized in Spain due to COVID-19.
Methods
Nationwide, retrospective, observational analysis of all adults hospitalized because of COVID-19 in Spain during 2020. Stratification was made according to SOT status. The National Registry of Hospital Discharges was used, using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision coding list.
Results
Of the 117,694 adults hospitalized during this period, 491 were SOTR: kidney 390 (79.4%), liver 59 (12%), lung 27 (5.5%), and heart 19 (3.9%). Overall, the mortality of SOTR was 13.8%. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, SOTR was not associated with higher mortality risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60-1.03). However, lung transplantation was an independent factor related to mortality (OR = 3.26, 95% CI 1.33-7.43), while kidney, liver, and heart transplantation were not. Being a lung transplant recipient was the strongest prognostic factor in SOT patients (OR = 5.12, 95% CI 1.88-13.98).
Conclusion
This nationwide study supports that the COVID-19 mortality rate in SOTR in Spain during 2020 did not differ from the general population, except for lung transplant recipients, who presented worse outcomes. Efforts should be focused on the optimal management of lung transplant recipients with COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
The emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) threaten the effectiveness of current COVID-19 vaccines administered intramuscularly and designed to only target the spike protein. There is a pressing need to develop next-generation vaccine strategies for broader and long-lasting protection. Using adenoviral vectors (Ad) of human and chimpanzee origin, we evaluated Ad-vectored trivalent COVID-19 vaccines expressing spike-1, nucleocapsid, and RdRp antigens in murine models. We show that single-dose intranasal immunization, particularly with chimpanzee Ad-vectored vaccine, is superior to intramuscular immunization in induction of the tripartite protective immunity consisting of local and systemic antibody responses, mucosal tissue-resident memory T cells and mucosal trained innate immunity. We further show that intranasal immunization provides protection against both the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and two VOC, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Our findings indicate that respiratory mucosal delivery of Ad-vectored multivalent vaccine represents an effective next-generation COVID-19 vaccine strategy to induce all-around mucosal immunity against current and future VOC.

AB  - Complement is integral to a healthy functioning immune system and orchestrates various innate and adaptive responses against viruses and other pathogens. Despite its importance, the potential beneficial role of complement in immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been overshadowed by reports of extensive complement activation in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Here, we hypothesize that complement may also have a protective role and could function to enhance virus neutralization by antibodies, promote virus phagocytosis by immune cells, and lysis of virus. These functions might be exploited in the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, the news of clinical trials for vaccines and mass vaccinations have brought renewed optimism for stabilizing the economy and financial markets. However, the mental stress of investors or doubt about the effectiveness of government policies to cope with economic disruptions has caused stock market volatility. We investigate the significance of the vaccination rate in alleviating the global stock market volatility which is measured by the GJR–GARCH model. We discover that a higher vaccine initiation rate has a positive effect on global stock markets, especially in developed countries and areas with higher rates than their average. Our findings remain reliable even when using different projected volatility models and other estimates of the main independent variables. Mass immunization also implies that governments will not have to take extreme measures to handle the pandemic, which alleviates investor worries about compliance and the prolonged effects of COVID-19. Our research indicates that global stock markets are providing insight into the economic value of the development of COVID-19 vaccines, even before public vaccinations start.

AB  - Several vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are expected to be available in Australia in 2021. Initial supply is limited and will require a judicious vaccination strategy until supply is unrestricted. If vaccines have efficacy as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in contacts, this provides more policy options. We used a deterministic mathematical model of epidemic response with limited supply (age-targeted or ring vaccination) and mass vaccination for the State of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia. For targeted vaccination, the effectiveness of vaccinating health workers, young people and older adults was compared. For mass vaccination, we tested varying vaccine efficacy (VE) and distribution capacities. With a limited vaccine stockpile enough for 1 million people in NSW, if there is efficacy as PEP, the most efficient way to control COVID-19 will be ring vaccination, however at least 90% of contacts per case needs to be traced and vaccinated. Health worker vaccination is required for health system resilience. Age based strategies with restricted doses make minimal impact on the epidemic, but vaccinating older people prevents more deaths. Herd immunity can only be achieved with mass vaccination. With 90% VE against all infection, herd immunity can be achieved by vaccinating 66% of the population. A vaccine with less than 70% VE cannot achieve herd immunity and will result in ongoing risk of outbreaks. For mass vaccination, distributing at least 60,000 doses per day is required to achieve control. Slower rates of vaccination will result in the population living with COVID-19 longer, and higher cases and deaths.

AB  - Abstracts
Developing and distributing a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccine has garnered immense global interest. Less than a year after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, several vaccine candidates had received emergency use authorization across a range of countries. Despite this scientific breakthrough, the journey from vaccine discovery to global herd immunity against COVID-19 continues to present significant policy challenges that require a collaborative, global response. We offer a framework for understanding remaining and new policy challenges for successful global vaccine campaigns against COVID-19 as well as potential solutions to address them. Decision-makers must be aware of these challenges and strategize solutions that can be implemented at scale. These include challenges around maintaining R&D incentives, running clinical trials, authorizations, post-market surveillance, manufacturing and supply, global dissemination, allocation, uptake, and clinical system adaption. Alongside these challenges, financial and ethical concerns must also be addressed.

AB  - The novel corona virus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread throughout the globe at a formidable speed, causing tens of millions of cases and more than one million deaths in less than a year of its report in December 2019. Since then, companies and research institutions have raced to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, ranging from conventional viral and protein-based vaccines to those that are more cutting edge, including DNA- and mRNA-based vaccines. Each vaccine exhibits a different potency and duration of efficacy, as determined by the antigen design, adjuvant molecules, vaccine delivery platforms, and immunization method. In this review, we will introduce a few of the leading non-viral vaccines that are under clinical stage development and discuss delivery strategies to improve vaccine efficacy, duration of protection, safety, and mass vaccination.

AB  - Summary
Background
India has been severely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to shortcomings in disease surveillance, the burden of mortality associated with COVID-19 remains poorly understood. We aimed to assess changes in mortality during the pandemic in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, using data on all-cause mortality within the district.
Methods
For this observational study, we analysed comprehensive death registrations in Chennai, from Jan 1, 2016, to June 30, 2021. We estimated expected mortality without the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by fitting models to observed mortality time series during the pre-pandemic period, with stratification by age and sex. Additionally, we considered three periods of interest: the first 4 weeks of India's first lockdown (March 24 to April 20, 2020), the 4-month period including the first wave of the pandemic in Chennai (May 1 to Aug 31, 2020), and the 4-month period including the second wave of the pandemic in Chennai (March 1 to June 30, 2021). We computed the difference between observed and expected mortality from March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021, and compared pandemic-associated mortality across socioeconomically distinct communities (measured with use of 2011 census of India data) with regression analyses.
Findings
Between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, 87 870 deaths were registered in areas of Chennai district represented by the 2011 census, exceeding expected deaths by 25 990 (95% uncertainty interval 25 640–26 360) or 5·18 (5·11–5·25) excess deaths per 1000 people. Stratified by age, excess deaths numbered 21·02 (20·54–21·49) excess deaths per 1000 people for individuals aged 60–69 years, 39·74 (38·73–40·69) for those aged 70–79 years, and 96·90 (93·35–100·16) for those aged 80 years or older. Neighbourhoods with lower socioeconomic status had 0·7% to 2·8% increases in pandemic-associated mortality per 1 SD increase in each measure of community disadvantage, due largely to a disproportionate increase in mortality within these neighbourhoods during the second wave. Conversely, differences in excess mortality across communities were not clearly associated with socioeconomic status measures during the first wave. For each increase by 1 SD in measures of community disadvantage, neighbourhoods had 3·6% to 8·6% lower pandemic-associated mortality during the first 4 weeks of India's country-wide lockdown, before widespread SARS-CoV-2 circulation was underway in Chennai. The greatest reductions in mortality during this early lockdown period were observed among men aged 20–29 years, with 58% (54–62) fewer deaths than expected from pre-pandemic trends.
Interpretation
Mortality in Chennai increased substantially but heterogeneously during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the greatest burden concentrated in disadvantaged communities. Reported COVID-19 deaths greatly underestimated pandemic-associated mortality.

AB  - The vigorous spread of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in the rapid infection of millions of people worldwide and devastation of not only public healthcare, but also social, educational, and economic infrastructures. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over time is due to the mutations that occurred in the genome during each replication. These mutated forms of SARS-CoV-2, otherwise known as variants, were categorized as variants of interest (VOI) or variants of concern (VOC) based on the increased risk of transmissibility, disease severity, immune escape, decreased effectiveness of current social measures, and available vaccines and therapeutics. The swift development of COVID-19 vaccines has been a great success for biomedical research, and billions of vaccine doses, including boosters, have been administered worldwide. BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer–BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) are the four major COVID-19 vaccines that received early regulatory authorization based on their efficacy. However, some SARS-CoV-2 variants resulted in higher resistance to available vaccines or treatments. It has been four years since the first reported infection of SARS-CoV-2, yet the Omicron variant and its subvariants are still infecting people worldwide. Despite this, COVID-19 vaccines are still expected to be effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death from COVID. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 pandemic focused on evolution of VOC and vaccination strategies against them.

AB  - Background
During 2021, Peru started the vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 using the BBIBP-CorV inactivated virus vaccine for health care workers (HCW). We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and deaths among HCWs.
Methods
Retrospective cohort study, from February 9 to June 30, 2021, using national registries of health care workers, laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 and deaths. We calculated the vaccine effectiveness for preventing laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-mortality, and all-cause mortality among partially immunized and fully immunized HCWs. An extension of Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the mortality results, and Poisson regression was used to model SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Results
The study included 606,772 eligible HCWs, the mean age was 40 (IQR: 33.0, 51.0). In fully immunized HCW, the effectiveness for preventing all-cause mortality was 83.6 (95% CI: 80.2 to 86.4), 88.7 (95% CI: 85.1 to 91.4) for preventing COVID-19 mortality, and 40.3 (95% CI 38.9 to 41.6) for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Conclusion
The BBIBP-CorV vaccine showed high levels of effectiveness for preventing all-cause and COVID-19 deaths among fully immunized HCW. These results were consistent within different subgroups and sensitivity analyses. However, the effectiveness for preventing infection was suboptimal in this particular setting.

AB  - Since its appearance in Wuhan (China) in late December 2019, the geographical spread of COVID-19 and its constituent waves varied in pace and intensity around the world. Responses to the pandemic also varied across the world with high variation in case rates, death rates, and estimated excess mortality rates. This article addresses the political factors that may have shaped this variation. We test the proposition that the observed variation in case rates, death rates, and estimated excess mortality can be partly explained by differences across levels of democracy and autocracy, while controlling for additional possible confounding factors using a cross-section time-series data set for 155 countries between January 2020 and December 2021. The analysis begins with a theoretical consideration of the different ways in which democratic and authoritarian governments can respond to national emergencies such as a global pandemic and the expected effect of regime features on that response. For reported case rates and death rates, our analysis shows that democracies have a far worse record of pandemic response and control than autocracies. For estimated excess mortality rates and the ratio of these rates to reported death rates, however, our analysis shows that variation is more tightly captured by clusters of poor democracies and poor autocracies in particular geographies in the world. The difference in results for recorded COVID data and estimated excess mortality suggest that transparency in reporting within democracies may explain an otherwise spurious relationship between regime type and COVID response. Our findings suggest that future pandemics and other public health threats require much better coordination, control, and transparent reporting protocols that are less encumbered by politics than has been observable during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - ‘Deprivation amplification’ is used to understand the relationship between deprivation, scale and COVID-19 mortality rates. We found that more deprived Middle Super Output Areas (MSOAs) in the more deprived northern regions suffered greater COVID-19 mortality rates. Across England, the most deprived 20% of MSOAs had higher mortality than the least deprived (44.1% more COVID-19 deaths/10,000). However, the most deprived MSOAs in the north fared worse than equally deprived areas in the rest of England (14.5% more deaths/10,000, beta = 0.136, p < 0.01). There was also strong evidence of spatial clustering and spill-overs. We discuss these findings in relation to ‘deprivation amplification’, the ‘syndemic pandemic’, and the health and place literature.

Using Joinpoint regression analysis, we estimated the expected suicide mortality in 2020 based on suicide mortality from 2011 to 2019, and compared results to the actual suicide mortality in Japan. We found that actual suicide mortality was significantly higher than the expected mortality among both men (excess mortality rate: 107.0%) and women (120.1%). This higher excess suicide mortality rate was particularly notable in women aged in their 20 s (154.0%) and 30s-40 s (130.7%).

AB  - Objective
This study examines the factors influencing vaccination rollout and its effectiveness in reducing infectious disease outbreaks in African countries. It aims to understand why some countries performed better in vaccination coverage than others and explores the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations in conjunction with the stringency index in Africa.
Methods
Two data sources were utilized. Firstly, a scoping review of relevant studies and gray literature was conducted using the Arksey H & O'Malley L methodological framework. Additionally, data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT dataset) were analysed to explore the effect of COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. Regression discontinuity in time was employed to assess the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on new COVID-19 cases, deaths, and reproduction rate.
Results
The study found that the number of vaccinated individuals increased from March 2021, while the stringency index steadily declined since January 2021. Despite higher vaccination coverage, new COVID-19 cases and deaths peaked in late 2021 and early 2022, indicating the continued need for non-pharmaceutical interventions. After considering country fixed effects and other covariates, the number of new cases and deaths were negatively associated with the stringency index and vaccine introduction.
Conclusion
COVID-19 vaccination was shown to be crucial in reducing new cases and deaths in Africa. However, vaccination progress in the region remains low and is influenced by factors at both structural and micro levels. Further research is required to disentangle the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions and other measures from vaccination campaigns in the context of Africa while accounting for other contributing factors.
Lay summary
This study aimed to understand why some African countries did better than others in their COVID-19 vaccination efforts and how these vaccinations affected the spread of the virus. Researchers reviewed existing studies and government data along with the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. While vaccinations increased from March 2021 and strict measures eased from January 2021, new cases and deaths remained high in late 2021 and early 2022, indicating the need for additional measures. Stricter government actions and higher vaccination rates were linked to fewer cases and deaths. In Africa, COVID-19 vaccinations are crucial, but progress is slow due to various factors at both macro and individual levels. Further research is required to understand the interplay between vaccinations, other measures, and controlling the virus.

AB  - Summary
COVID-19 has exacerbated endemic health inequalities resulting in a syndemic pandemic of higher mortality and morbidity rates among the most socially disadvantaged. We did a scoping review to identify and synthesise published evidence on geographical inequalities in COVID-19 mortality rates globally. We included peer-reviewed studies, from any country, written in English that showed any area-level (eg, neighbourhood, town, city, municipality, or region) inequalities in mortality by socioeconomic deprivation (ie, measured via indices of multiple deprivation: the percentage of people living in poverty or proxy factors including the Gini coefficient, employment rates, or housing tenure). 95 papers from five WHO global regions were included in the final synthesis. A large majority of the studies (n=86) found that COVID-19 mortality rates were higher in areas of socioeconomic disadvantage than in affluent areas. The subsequent discussion reflects on how the unequal nature of the pandemic has resulted from a syndemic of COVID-19 and endemic inequalities in chronic disease burden.

AB  - Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two other coronaviruses that caused disease epidemic breakouts in humans in the last 2 decades, namely, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The similarities have enabled the scientists to apply the basic scientific discoveries garnered from studying the structure and modus operandi of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to develop therapies that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 and to develop vaccines to prevent COVID-19. Targeted therapies including the use of antibodies to prevent virus entry, nucleotide analogues to prevent viral replication, and inhibitors of proteases to prevent virion formation, among others, are being tested for their clinical efficacy. Likewise, complete sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 and identification of its structural and nonstructural proteins have enabled development of RNA-, DNA-, and peptide-based vaccines as well attenuated viral vaccines to instigate the host-immune responses. The clinical impacts of the basic science discoveries are amply evident on the rapid pace of progress in developing specific antiviral therapies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The progress emphasizes the merit of discovering the fundamental scientific elements, regardless of whether or not they have apparent or immediate clinical applications.

AB  - Summary
Background
Disparities in COVID-19 mortality by race/ethnicity or neighborhood have been documented using surveillance data. We aimed to describe disparities by race/ethnicity and neighbourhood social vulnerability in COVID-19 positivity, hospitalization, and mortality.
Methods
We obtained data from the electronic health records of all individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 in the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) or were hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection in five UPHS hospitals from March 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021. The main predictors were race/ethnicity and neighbourhood-level social vulnerability. The main outcomes were COVID-19 test positivity, hospitalization with COVID-19, and 30-day in-hospital mortality following hospitalization with COVID-19.
Findings
A total of 225,129 unique individuals received COVID-19 testing and 18,995 had a positive test result. A total of 5,794 unique patients were hospitalized with COVID-19 and 511 died in-hospital within 30 days. Racial/ethnic minority groups and residents of higher social vulnerability neighbourhoods had higher test positivity and risk of hospitalization. We did not see in-hospital mortality disparities during the first wave but observed 75% and 68% higher odds of death among Hispanic and Asians compared to Whites during subsequent waves.
Interpretation
We observed significant racial/ethnic and neighbourhood disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, especially test positivity and odds of hospitalization, highlighting the importance of equitably improving access to preventive measures to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection, including reducing exposure to the virus and ensuring equity in vaccination.

AB  - During the pandemic period, health care systems were substantially reorganized for managing COVID-19 cases. Corresponding consequences on persons with chronic diseases remain insufficiently documented. This observational cohort study investigated the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic period on the survival of kidney transplant recipients (KTR). Using the French National Health Data System, incident persons with end-stage kidney disease between 2015 and 2020, and who received a kidney transplant during this period were included and followed up from their transplantation date to December 31, 2021. The survival of KTR during the prepandemic and pandemic periods was investigated using Cox models with time-dependent covariates. There were 10 637 KTR included in the study, with 324 and 430 deaths observed during the prepandemic and pandemic periods, respectively. The adjusted risk of death during the pandemic period was similar to that observed during the prepandemic period (hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval]: 0.92 [0.77-1.11]), COVID-19–related hospitalization was associated with an increased risk of death (HR: 10.62 [8.46-13.33]), and a third vaccine dose was associated with a lower risk of death (HR: 0.42 [0.30-0.57]). The pandemic period was not associated with an indirect higher risk of death in KTR with no COVID-19–related hospitalization.

AB  - Background
Countries have adopted different COVID-19 policies to contain the transmission of the disease and to prepare for vaccination rollout. Countries’ political context, vaccine policy history, and health systems’ responses impacted COVID-19 health outcomes.
Objective
This study focused on synthesizing and examining COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions in Brazil and Portugal, understanding the enablers and barriers to COVID-19 vaccination access and distribution, and health and non-health outcomes across three time-points: before vaccination, during mass vaccination, and after the declaration of endemicity.
Methods
Extensive qualitative document analysis of secondary sources published in Portuguese and English over the past three years, and examination of primary publicly available epidemiological data since the beginning of the pandemic.
Results
In the first year of the pandemic, the COVID-19 government response between the two countries was dissimilar; effective coordination, trust in the government response and political alignment in Portugal contrasted the political denial of the pandemic, lack of coordination between the various levels of government, at the same time the Brazilian population engaged in protective behaviours and distrusted the government. The COVID-19 vaccination had a good response from the public, associated with a primary care level network of distribution, low vaccine hesitancy, and strong childhood immunization programs before the pandemic in both countries. Vaccine manufacturing in Brazil and the strong support from the European Union to Portugal on vaccine acquisition have also aided these countries in achieving high COVID-19 vaccination coverage.
Conclusion
Future policies to promote a well-functioning and resilient health system should consider medical and nursing workforce sustainability, equity in all policies, building public trust, strengthening health system governance, and improving preparedness and surveillance.

AB  - Excess inflammation and oxidative stress are common themes in many pathologies of pregnancy including preeclampsia and more recently severe COVID-19. The risk of preeclampsia increases following maternal infection with COVID-19, potentially relating to significant overlap in pathophysiology with endothelial, vascular and immunological dysfunction common to both. Identifying a therapy which addresses these injurious processes and stabilises the endothelial and vascular maternal system would help address the significant global burden of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality they cause. Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring phytonutrient found most densely within cruciferous vegetables. It has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immune modulating properties via upregulation of phase-II detoxification enzymes. This review will cover the common pathways shared by COVID-19 and preeclampsia and offer a potential therapeutic target via nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor upregulation in the form of sulforaphane.

AB  - Summary
Background
Before widespread vaccination, the United States was disproportionately affected by COVID-19 with a mortality rate several times that of other affluent societies. Comparing regions with different rates of health insurance, we assess how much of this excess mortality may be due to the relatively large population without health insurance.
Methods
We use daily surveillance data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stratified by region, age group, gender, and race in regression analysis of daily COVID-19 cases, hospitalization, and mortality. COVID-19 data have been matched with structural characteristics of the region including average proportion with health insurance. As checks, we have estimated regressions for different time periods, different groups of states, and by comparing adjacent counties between states with and without Medicaid expansion.
Findings
Groups with lower health insurance coverage had significantly higher mortality as well as greater case counts and hospitalization. Early in the pandemic, they were also less likely to be tested for COVID-19. Applying our regression estimates, we estimate that had there been full health insurance coverage of the population, there would have been 60,000 fewer deaths, 26% of the total death toll in the period of this analysis.
Interpretation
Our study demonstrates that a significant share of COVID-19 mortality in the United States, and much of the excess mortality in the United States compared with other countries, is due to our reliance on a system of market-driven healthcare. Providing universal insurance coverage should be part of our campaign to reduce COVID-19 mortality. It also suggests that these concerns should not be restricted to COVID-19 but apply across all diseases, contributing to many unnecessary deaths in the United States each year even apart from the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Objectives
Indigenous populations have been disproportionately affected during pandemics. We investigated COVID-19 mortality estimates among indigenous and non-indigenous populations at national and sub-national levels in Mexico.
Methods
We obtained data from the Ministry of Health, Mexico, on 2,173,036 laboratory-confirmed RT-PCR positive COVID-19 cases and 238,803 deaths. We estimated mortality per 1000 person-weeks, mortality rate ratio (RR) among indigenous vs. non-indigenous groups, and hazard ratio (HR) for COVID-19 deaths across four waves of the pandemic, from February 2020 to March 2022. We also assessed differences in the reproduction number (Rt).
Results
The mortality rate among indigenous populations of Mexico was 68% higher than that of non-indigenous groups. Out of 32 federal entities, 23 exhibited higher mortality rates among indigenous groups (P < 0.05 in 13 entities). The fourth wave showed the highest RR (2.40). The crude HR was 1.67 (95% CI: 1.62, 1.72), which decreased to 1.08 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.11) after controlling for other covariates. During the intense fourth wave, the Rt among the two groups was comparable.
Conclusion
Indigenous status is a significant risk factor for COVID-19 mortality in Mexico. Our findings may reflect disparities in non-pharmaceutical (e.g., handwashing and using facemasks), and COVID-19 vaccination interventions among indigenous and non-indigenous populations in Mexico.

AB  - Summary
Background
To date, influenza epidemics have been considered suitable for use as a model for the COVID-19 epidemic, given that they are respiratory diseases with similar modes of transmission. However, data directly comparing the two diseases are scarce.
Methods
We did a nationwide retrospective cohort study using the French national administrative database (PMSI), which includes discharge summaries for all hospital admissions in France. All patients hospitalised for COVID-19 from March 1 to April 30, 2020, and all patients hospitalised for influenza between Dec 1, 2018, and Feb 28, 2019, were included. The diagnosis of COVID-19 (International Classification of Diseases [10th edition] codes U07.10, U07.11, U07.12, U07.14, or U07.15) or influenza (J09, J10, or J11) comprised primary, related, or associated diagnosis. Comparisons of risk factors, clinical characteristics, and outcomes between patients hospitalised for COVID-19 and influenza were done, with data also stratified by age group.
Findings
89 530 patients with COVID-19 and 45 819 patients with influenza were hospitalised in France during the respective study periods. The median age of patients was 68 years (IQR 52–82) for COVID-19 and 71 years (34–84) for influenza. Patients with COVID-19 were more frequently obese or overweight, and more frequently had diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia than patients with influenza, whereas those with influenza more frequently had heart failure, chronic respiratory disease, cirrhosis, and deficiency anaemia. Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 more frequently developed acute respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, septic shock, or haemorrhagic stroke than patients with influenza, but less frequently developed myocardial infarction or atrial fibrillation. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with influenza (15 104 [16·9%] of 89 530 vs 2640 [5·8%] of 45 819), with a relative risk of death of 2·9 (95% CI 2·8–3·0) and an age-standardised mortality ratio of 2·82. Of the patients hospitalised, the proportion of paediatric patients (<18 years) was smaller for COVID-19 than for influenza (1227 [1·4%] vs 8942 [19·5%]), but a larger proportion of patients younger than 5 years needed intensive care support for COVID-19 than for influenza (14 [2·3%] of 613 vs 65 [0·9%] of 6973). In adolescents (11–17 years), the in-hospital mortality was ten-times higher for COVID-19 than for influenza (five [1·1% of 458 vs one [0·1%] of 804), and patients with COVID-19 were more frequently obese or overweight.
Interpretation
The presentation of patients with COVID-19 and seasonal influenza requiring hospitalisation differs considerably. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is likely to have a higher potential for respiratory pathogenicity, leading to more respiratory complications and to higher mortality. In children, although the rate of hospitalisation for COVID-19 appears to be lower than for influenza, in-hospital mortality is higher; however, low patient numbers limit this finding. These findings highlight the importance of appropriate preventive measures for COVID-19, as well as the need for a specific vaccine and treatment.

AB  - With the recent approval and widespread administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen vaccines worldwide, incidence of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has significantly decreased. In spite of their undisputed role in reducing the severity of the disease and reduction of the disease burden in the community, there have been case reports of serious side effects with these vaccines. We aim to describe a case report of myocarditis following administration of the Janssen vaccine in a healthy, young male and review the available literature on COVID-19 vaccine related myocarditis and its possible pathogenesis. This case and literature review notes a temporal association between COVID-19 vaccination and myocarditis. Despite these observations, the benefits of the vaccines far outweigh the risks of possible myocarditis.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has profound adverse effects on the population on dialysis. Patients requiring dialysis are at an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality, and many have experienced psychological distress as well as delayed or suboptimal care. COVID-19 survivors have prolonged viral shedding, but generally develop a robust and long-lasting humoral immune response that correlates with initial disease severity. However, protection against reinfection is incomplete. A growing body of evidence reveals delayed and blunted immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Administration of a third dose within 1 to 2 months of prime-boost vaccination significantly increases antibody levels, in particular in patients with poor initial responses. Patients on dialysis have inferior immune responses to adenoviral vector vaccines than to mRNA vaccines. The immunogenicity of the mRNA-1273 vaccine is markedly better than that of the BNT162b2 vaccine, most likely by virtue of its higher mRNA content. Despite suboptimal immune responses in patients on dialysis, preliminary data suggest that vaccination partially protects against infection and severe disease requiring hospitalization. However, progressive waning of immunity and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with a high potential of immune escape call for a booster dose in all patients on dialysis 4 to 6 months after prime-boost vaccination. Patients with persistent poor vaccine responses may be candidates for primary prophylaxis strategies. In the absence of specific data in patients on dialysis, therapeutic strategies in the event of established COVID-19 must be extrapolated from evidence obtained in the population not on dialysis. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies may be an attractive option after a high-risk exposure or during the early course of infection.

AB  - Introduction
The COVID19 pandemic had a strong impact on the healthcare system, particularly in oncology. Brain tumor are usually revealed by acute and life threatening symptoms. We wanted to evaluate the possible consequences of the COVID19 pandemic in 2020 on the activity of neuro-oncology multidisciplinary tumor board in a Normandy region (France).
Methods
A descriptive, retrospective, multicenter study was conducted in the four referent centers (two universitary hospitals and two cancer centers). The main objective was to compare the average number of neuro-oncology patients presented per multidisciplinary tumor board per week between a pre-COVID19 reference period (period 1 from December 2018 to December 2019) and the pre-vaccination period (period 2 from December 2019 to November 2020).
Results
Across Normandy, 1540 cases were presented in neuro-oncology multidisciplinary tumor board in 2019 and 2020. No difference was observed between period 1 and 2: respectively 9.8 per week versus 10.7, P=0.36. The number of cases per week also did not significantly differ during the lockdown periods: 9.1/week versus 10.4 during the non-lockdown periods, P=0.26. The only difference observed was a higher proportion of tumor resection during the lockdown periods: 81.4% (n=79/174) versus 64.5% (n=408/1366), P=0.001.
Conclusion
The pre-vaccination era of the COVID19 pandemic did not impact the activity of neuro-oncology multidisciplinary tumor board in the Normandy region. The possible consequences in terms of public health (excess mortality) due to this tumor location should now be investigated.

AB  - Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic is unlikely to end until there is global roll-out of vaccines that protect against severe disease and preferably drive herd immunity. Regulators in numerous countries have authorised or approved COVID-19 vaccines for human use, with more expected to be licensed in 2021. Yet having licensed vaccines is not enough to achieve global control of COVID-19: they also need to be produced at scale, priced affordably, allocated globally so that they are available where needed, and widely deployed in local communities. In this Health Policy paper, we review potential challenges to success in each of these dimensions and discuss policy implications. To guide our review, we developed a dashboard to highlight key characteristics of 26 leading vaccine candidates, including efficacy levels, dosing regimens, storage requirements, prices, production capacities in 2021, and stocks reserved for low-income and middle-income countries. We use a traffic-light system to signal the potential contributions of each candidate to achieving global vaccine immunity, highlighting important trade-offs that policy makers need to consider when developing and implementing vaccination programmes. Although specific datapoints are subject to change as the pandemic response progresses, the dashboard will continue to provide a useful lens through which to analyse the key issues affecting the use of COVID-19 vaccines. We also present original data from a 32-country survey (n=26 758) on potential acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, conducted from October to December, 2020. Vaccine acceptance was highest in Vietnam (98%), India (91%), China (91%), Denmark (87%), and South Korea (87%), and lowest in Serbia (38%), Croatia (41%), France (44%), Lebanon (44%), and Paraguay (51%).

AB  - Background
In 2020, the American West faced two competing challenges: the COVID-19 pandemic and the worst wildfire season on record. Several studies have investigated the impact of wildfire smoke (WFS) on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, but little is known about how these two public health challenges impact mortality risk for other causes.
Objectives
Using a time-series design, we evaluated how daily risk of mortality due to WFS exposure differed for periods before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
Our study included daily data for 11 counties in the Front Range region of Colorado (2010–2020). We assessed WFS exposure using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and used mortality counts from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. We estimated the interaction between WFS and the pandemic (an indicator variable) on mortality risk using generalized additive models adjusted for year, day of week, fine particulate matter, ozone, temperature, and a smoothed term for day of year.
Results
WFS impacted the study area on 10% of county-days. We observed a positive association between the presence of WFS and all-cause mortality risk (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.03, 95%CI: 1.01–1.04 for same-day exposures) during the period before the pandemic; however, WFS exposure during the pandemic resulted in decreased risk of all-cause mortality (IRR = 0.90, 95%CI: 0.87–0.93 for same-day exposures).
Discussion
We hypothesize that mitigation efforts during the first year of the pandemic, e.g., mask mandates, along with high ambient WFS levels encouraged health behaviors that reduced exposure to WFS and reduced risk of all-cause mortality. Our results suggest a need to examine how associations between WFS and mortality are impacted by pandemic-related factors and that there may be lessons from the pandemic that could be translated into health-protective policies during future wildfire events.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized in December 2019 in China and as of October5th, the pandemic was swept through 216 countries and infected around 34,824,108 individuals, thus posing an unprecedented threat to world's health and economy. Several researchers reported that, a significant mutation in membrane proteins and receptor binding sites of preceding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to turned as novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and disease was named as COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019). Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19 patients. The lessons learned from the past management of SARS-CoV and other pandemics, have provided some insights to treat COVID-19. Currently, therapies like anti-viral treatment, immunomodulatory agents, plasma transfusion and supportive intervention etc., are using to treat the COVID-19. Few of these were proven to provide significant therapeutic benefits in treating the COVID-19, however no drug is approved by the regulatory agencies. As the fatality rate is high in patients with comorbid conditions, we have also enlightened the current in-line treatment therapies and specific treatment strategies in comorbid conditions to combat the emergence of COVID-19. In addition, pharmaceutical, biological companies and research institutions across the globe have begun to develop thesafe and effective vaccine for COVID-19. Globally around 170 teams of researchers are racing to develop the COVID-19 vaccine and here we have discussed about their current status of development. Furthermore, recent patents filed in association with COVID-19 was elaborated. This can help many individuals, researchers or health workers, in applying these principles for diagnosis/prevention/management/treatment of the current pandemic.

AB  - Summary
Background
The safety and immunogenicity profile of COVID-19 vaccines when administered concomitantly with seasonal influenza vaccines have not yet been reported. We therefore aimed to report the results of a substudy within a phase 3 UK trial, by evaluating the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 when co-administered with licensed seasonal influenza vaccines.
Methods
We did a planned exploratory substudy as part of the randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) by co-administrating the influenza vaccine at four study hospitals in the UK. Approximately, the first 400 participants meeting the main study entry criteria—with no contraindications to influenza vaccination—were invited to join the substudy. Participants of the main study were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive two intramuscular injections of either NVX-CoV2373 (5 μg) or placebo (normal saline) 21 days apart; participants enrolled into the substudy were co-vaccinated with a single (0·5 mL) intramuscular, age-appropriate (quadrivalent influenza cell-based vaccine [Flucelvax Quadrivalent; Seqirus UK, Maidenhead] for those aged 18–64 years and adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine [Fluad; Seqirus UK, Maidenhead] for those ≥65 years), licensed, influenza vaccine on the opposite deltoid to that of the first study vaccine dose or placebo. The influenza vaccine was administered in an open-label manner and at the same time as the first study injection. Reactogenicity was evaluated via an electronic diary for 7 days after vaccination in addition to monitoring for unsolicited adverse events, medically attended adverse events, and serious adverse events. Immunogenicity was assessed with influenza haemagglutination inhibition and SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike protein IgG assays. Vaccine efficacy against PCR-confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19 was assessed in participants who were seronegative at baseline, received both doses of study vaccine or placebo, had no major protocol deviations affecting the primary endpoint, and had no confirmed cases of symptomatic COVID-19 from the first dose until 6 days after the second dose (per-protocol efficacy population). Immunogenicity was assessed in participants who received scheduled two doses of study vaccine, had a baseline sample and at least one post-vaccination sample, and had no major protocol violations before unmasking (per-protocol immunogenicity population). Reactogenicity was analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo and had data collected for reactogenicity events. Safety was analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo. Comparisons were made between participants of the substudy and the main study (who were not co-vaccinated for influenza). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04583995.
Findings
Between Sept 28, 2020, and Nov 28, 2020, a total of 15 187 participants were randomised into the main phase 3 trial, of whom 15 139 received treatment (7569 received dose one of NVX-CoV2373 and 7570 received dose one of placebo). 431 participants were co-vaccinated with a seasonal influenza vaccine in the substudy (217 received NVX-CoV2373 plus the influenza vaccine and 214 received placebo plus the influenza vaccine). In general, the substudy participants were younger, more racially diverse, and had fewer comorbid conditions than those in the main study. Reactogenicity events were more common in the co-administration group than in the NVX-CoV2373 alone group: tenderness (113 [64·9%] of 174 vs 592 [53·3%] of 1111) or pain (69 [39·7%] vs 325 [29·3%]) at injection site, fatigue (48 [27·7%] vs 215 [19·4%]), and muscle pain (49 [28·3%] vs 237 [21·4%]). Incidences of unsolicited adverse events, treatment-related medically attended adverse events, and serious adverse events were low and balanced between the co-administration group and the NVX-CoV2373 alone group. No episodes of anaphylaxis or deaths were reported within the substudy. Co-administration resulted in no change to influenza vaccine immune response although a reduction in antibody responses to the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was noted. NVX-CoV2373 vaccine efficacy in the substudy (ie, participants aged 18 to <65 years) was 87·5% (95% CI −0·2 to 98·4) and in the main study was 89·8% (95% CI 79·7–95·5).
Interpretation
To our knowledge, this substudy is the first to show the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy profile of a COVID-19 vaccine when co-administered with seasonal influenza vaccines. Our results suggest concomitant vaccination might be a viable immunisation strategy.

AB  - Introduction
Optimized allocation of medical resources to patients with COVID-19 has been a critical concern since the onset of the pandemic.
Methods
In this retrospective cohort study, the authors used data from a Brazilian tertiary university hospital to explore predictors of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and hospital mortality in patients admitted for COVID-19. Our primary aim was to create and validate prediction scores for use in hospitals and emergency departments to aid clinical decisions and resource allocation.
Results
The study cohort included 3,022 participants, of whom 2,485 were admitted to the ICU; 1968 survived, and 1054 died in the hospital. From the complete cohort, 1,496 patients were randomly assigned to the derivation sample and 1,526 to the validation sample. The final scores included age, comorbidities, and baseline laboratory data. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were very similar for the derivation and validation samples. Scores for ICU admission had a 75% accuracy in the validation sample, whereas scores for death had a 77% accuracy in the validation sample. The authors found that including baseline flu-like symptoms in the scores added no significant benefit to their accuracy. Furthermore, our scores were more accurate than the previously published NEWS-2 and 4C Mortality Scores.
Discussion and conclusions
The authors developed and validated prognostic scores that use readily available clinical and laboratory information to predict ICU admission and mortality in COVID-19. These scores can become valuable tools to support clinical decisions and improve the allocation of limited health resources.

AB  - Previous research on commercial determinants of health has primarily focused on their impact on non-communicable diseases. However, they also impact on infectious diseases and on the broader preconditions for health. We describe, through case studies in 16 countries, how commercial determinants of health were visible during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how they may have influenced national responses and health outcomes. We use a comparative qualitative case study design in selected low- middle- and high-income countries that performed differently in COVID-19 health outcomes, and for which we had country experts to lead local analysis. We created a data collection framework and developed detailed case studies, including extensive grey and peer-reviewed literature. Themes were identified and explored using iterative rapid literature reviews. We found evidence of the influence of commercial determinants of health in the spread of COVID-19. This occurred through working conditions that exacerbated spread, including precarious, low-paid employment, use of migrant workers, procurement practices that limited the availability of protective goods and services such as personal protective equipment, and commercial actors lobbying against public health measures. Commercial determinants also influenced health outcomes by influencing vaccine availability and the health system response to COVID-19. Our findings contribute to determining the appropriate role of governments in governing for health, wellbeing, and equity, and regulating and addressing negative commercial determinants of health.

AB  - Objective
Persons with serious mental illness (SMI: schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder) experience increased risk of mortality after contracting COVID-19 based on the results of several international evaluations. However, information about COVID-19 mortality risk among patients with SMI in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has been limited, precluding identification of protective factors. The current evaluation was conducted to assess COVID-19 mortality risk among VHA patients with SMI and to evaluate potential protective factors in mitigating mortality risk following a positive COVID-19 diagnosis.
Methods
National VHA administrative data was used to identify all patients (N = 52,916) who received a positive COVID-19 test result between March 1, 2020, and September 30, 2020. Mortality risk was assessed by SMI status via bivariate comparisons and multivariate regression analyses.
Results
In unadjusted analyses, VHA patients with SMI overall and patients with bipolar disorder in particular did not experience increased mortality risk in the 30 days following a positive COVID test, although patients with schizophrenia had increased risk. Within adjusted analyses, patients with schizophrenia remained at increased mortality risk (OR = 1.38), but at reduced levels relative to previous evaluations in other healthcare settings.
Conclusions
Within VHA, patients with schizophrenia, but not those with bipolar disorder, experience increased mortality risk in the 30 days following a positive COVID-19 test. Large integrated healthcare settings such as VHA may offer services which may protect against COVID-19 mortality for vulnerable groups such as persons with SMI. Additional work is needed to identify practices which may reduce the risk of COVID-19 mortality among persons with SMI.

AB  - This paper discusses the findings of an empirical analysis of the Kuznets, or reverse U-shaped relationship, between the COVID-19 mortality rate and economic performance. In the early stages of economic development, the COVID-19 mortality rate is anticipated to rise with rising economic activity and urbanization. Eventually, the mortality rate decreases at higher economic development levels as people and the government are more capable of investing in disease abatement measures. The quality of political institutions, wealth distribution, urbanization, vaccination rate, and improvements in healthcare systems are hypothesized to affect the COVID-19 mortality rate. Examining this relationship can be effective in understanding the change in the COVID-19 mortality rate at different economic performance stages and in identifying appropriate preventive measures. This study employed the negative binomial regression to model a cross-sectional dataset of 137 countries. Results indicated that the relationship between the per-head gross domestic product (GDP) level and the COVID-19 mortality rate appeared to follow a pattern like the Kuznets curve, implying that changes in institutional quality, healthcare advancements, wealth distribution, urbanization, vaccination rate, and the percentage of the elderly population were significant in explaining the relationship. Improvement of the healthcare system has a notable effect on lowering the COVID-19 mortality rate under more effective government conditions. Additionally, the results suggested that a higher per-head GDP is required to reverse the rising trend of the mortality rate under higher income inequality. Based on these results, preventive measures, and policies to reduce COVID-19 mortalities were recommended in the conclusion section.

AB  - Scientists across the world are diligently seeking vaccines and cures for the novel SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) virus, which causes severe respiratory disease. Traditional medicine was found to have a significant therapeutic effect on recovering Covid-19 patients when combined with the infusion of corticosteroids, antivirals, and convalescent plasma. Here, we cover the contribution and effects of traditional medicine on Covid-19 patients. Early detection of Covid-19 and common safety precautions are among the infection prevention and control (IPC) techniques. The Covid-19 prevention methods include facemasks, social distancing, and vaccinations and are discussed. In addition, the survey of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, telemedicine, exposure detection via mobile apps, and electronic corona passport are also addressed. Although the vaccination pipeline looks promising in ending the Covid-19 infections, this review also provides awareness in the possibility of Covid-19 transmission within the community and the environmental impact of the pandemic.

AB  - This review shows that relatively simple changes to diet and lifestyle can significantly, and rapidly, reduce the risks associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in terms of infection risk, severity of disease, and even disease-related mortality. A wide range of interventions including regular exercise, adequate sleep, plant-based diets, maintenance of healthy weight, dietary supplementation, and time in nature have each been shown to have beneficial effects for supporting more positive health outcomes with COVID-19, in addition to promoting better overall health. This paper brings together literature from these areas and presents the argument that non-pharmaceutical approaches should not be overlooked in our response to COVID-19. It is noted that, in several cases, interventions discussed result in risk reductions equivalent to, or even greater than, those associated with currently available vaccines. Where the balance of evidence suggests benefits, and the risk is minimal to none, it is suggested that communicating the power of individual actions to the public becomes morally imperative. Further, many lives could be saved, and many harms from the vaccine mandates avoided, if we were willing to embrace this lifestyle-centred approach in our efforts to deal with COVID-19.

AB  - Analyzing the COVID-19 pandemic is a critical factor in developing effective policies to deal with similar challenges in the future. However, many parameters (e.g., the actual number of infected people, the effectiveness of vaccination) are still subject to considerable debate because they are unobservable. To model a pandemic and estimate unobserved parameters, researchers use compartmental models. Most often, in such models, the transition rates are considered as constants, which allows simulating only one epidemiological wave. However, multiple waves have been reported for COVID-19 caused by different strains of the virus. This paper presents an approach based on the reconstruction of real distributions of transition rates using genetic algorithms, which makes it possible to create a model that describes several pandemic peaks. The model is fitted on registered COVID-19 cases in four countries with different pandemic control strategies (Germany, Sweden, UK, and US). Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was chosen as the objective function, the MAPE values of 2.168%, 2.096%, 1.208% and 1.703% were achieved for the listed countries, respectively. Simulation results are consistent with the empirical statistics of medical studies, which confirms the quality of the model. In addition to observables such as registered infected, the output of the model contains variables that cannot be measured directly. Among them are the proportion of the population protected by vaccines, the size of the exposed compartment, and the number of unregistered cases of COVID-19. According to the results, at the peak of the pandemic, between 14% (Sweden) and 25% (the UK) of the population were infected. At the same time, the number of unregistered cases exceeds the number of registered cases by 17 and 3.4 times, respectively. The average duration of the vaccine induced immune period is shorter than claimed by vaccine manufacturers, and the effectiveness of vaccination has declined sharply since the appearance of the Delta and Omicron strains. However, on average, vaccination reduces the risk of infection by about 65–70%.

AB  - Background
With the rapid rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, numerous associated and suspected adverse events have been reported nationally and worldwide. Literature reporting confirmed cases of pericarditis and myocarditis following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations has evolved, with a predominance in adolescent males following the second dose.
Methods
This was a retrospective analysis of all patients presenting to St Vincent’s Hospital, Sydney, Australia with suspected COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis. The Brighton Collaboration Case Definitions of Myocarditis and Pericarditis were used to categorise patients into groups based on diagnostic certainty. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings were reviewed against updated Lake Louise Criteria for diagnosing patients with suspected myocarditis.
Results
We report 10 cases of confirmed, possible or probable myocarditis and pericarditis. The mean age of presentation in the vaccine group was 33±9.0 years. The most common presenting symptom was pleuritic chest pain (n=8, 80%). Eight patients (80%) had electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (n=6 pericarditis, n=2 myocarditis). Five patients (50%) had a minimum 24 hours of cardiac monitoring. One patient had multisystem inflammatory syndrome following vaccination (MIS-V) with severely impaired left ventricular ejection fraction and required admission to the intensive care unit.
Discussion and Conclusion
Cardiac complications post mRNA vaccines are rare. Our case series reflects the worldwide data that vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis most frequently occur in young males, following the second dose of the vaccine. These cardiac side effects are mild and self-limiting, with adequate responses to oral anti-inflammatories. One patient developed a severe reaction, with no fatal cases.

AB  - This paper presents a political economy analysis of global inequities in access to COVID-19 vaccines, treatments, and diagnostic tests. We adapt a conceptual model used for analysing the political economy of global extraction and health to examine the politico-economic factors affecting access to COVID-19 health products and technologies in four interconnected layers: the social, political, and historical context; politics, institutions, and policies; pathways to ill-health; and health consequences. Our analysis finds that battles over access to COVID-19 products occur in a profoundly unequal playing field, and that efforts to improve access that do not shift the fundamental power imbalances are bound to fail. Inequitable access has both direct effects on health (preventable illness and death) and indirect effects through exacerbation of poverty and inequality. We highlight how the case of COVID-19 products reflects broader patterns of structural violence, in which the political economy is structured to improve and lengthen the lives of those in the Global North while neglecting and shortening the lives of those in the Global South. We conclude that achieving equitable access to pandemic response products requires shifting longstanding power imbalances and the institutions and processes that entrench and enable them.

AB  - Background
The electrocardiography (ECG) has short-term prognostic value in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet its ability to predict long-term mortality is unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the predictive role of initial ECG on long-term all-cause mortality in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
Methods
In this prospective cohort study, adults with COVID-19 who underwent ECG testing within a 17-hospital health system in Northeast Ohio and Florida between 03/2020-06/2020 were identified. An expert ECG reader analyzed all studies blinded to patient status. The associations of ECG characteristics with long-term all-cause mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression model and multivariable logistic regression models, respectively. Status of long-term mortality was adjudicated on 01/07/2022.
Results
Of 837 patients (median age 65 years, 51% female, 44% Black), 683 (81.6%) were hospitalized, 281 (33.6%) required ICU admission, 67 (8.0%) died in-hospital, and 206 (24.6%) died at final follow-up after a median (IQR) of 21 (9-103) days after ECG. Overall, 179 (20.7%) patients presented with sinus tachycardia, 12 (1.4%) with atrial flutter, and 45 (5.4%) with atrial fibrillation (AF). After multivariable adjustment, sinus tachycardia (E-value for HR=3.09, lower CI=2.2) and AF (E-value for HR=3.13, lower CI=2.03) each independently predicted all-cause mortality. At final follow-up, patients with AF had 64.5% probability of death compared with 20.5% for those with normal sinus rhythm (P<.0001).
Conclusions
Sinus tachycardia and AF on initial ECG strongly predict long-term all-cause mortality in COVID-19. The ECG can serve as a powerful long-term prognostic tool in COVID-19.

AB  - A Lancet Commission for COVID-19 task force is shaping recommendations to achieve vaccine and therapeutics access, justice, and equity. This includes ensuring safety and effectiveness harmonized through robust systems of global pharmacovigilance and surveillance. Global production requires expanding support for development, manufacture, testing, and distribution of vaccines and therapeutics to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Global intellectual property rules must not stand in the way of research, production, technology transfer, or equitable access to essential health tools, and in context of pandemics to achieve increased manufacturing without discouraging innovation. Global governance around product quality requires channelling widely distributed vaccines through WHO prequalification (PQ)/emergency use listing (EUL) mechanisms and greater use of national regulatory authorities. A World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution would facilitate improvements and consistency in quality control and assurances. Global health systems require implementing steps to strengthen national systems for controlling COVID-19 and for influenza vaccinations for adults including pregnant and lactating women. A collaborative research network should strive to establish open access databases for bioinformatic analyses, together with programs directed at human capacity utilization and strengthening. Combating anti-science recognizes the urgency for countermeasures to address a global-wide disinformation movement dominating the internet and infiltrating parliaments and local governments.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 instigated by coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has delivered an unfathomable obstruction that has touched all sectors worldwide. Despite new vaccine technologies and mass administration of booster doses, the virus persists, and unknown the ending of the pandemic for new variants and sub-variants. Moreover, whether leaning on home medications or using plant extracts is sufficient often to combat the virus has generated tremendous interest in the scientific fraternity. Different databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar used to find published articles linked with related topics. Currently, COVID-19 third and fourth shots of vaccines are progressively administered worldwide, where some countries trail others by a significant margin. Many proteins related to viral activity have changed, possibly boosting the virus infectivity and making antibodies ineffective. This study will reminisce the viral genome, associated pathways for viral protein functions, variants, and their mutations. The current, comprehensive review will also provide information on vaccine technologies developed by several biotech companies and the efficacy of their doses, costs including boosters on a mass level. As no vaccine is working to protect fully against all the variants, the new proactive vaccine research needs to be conducted based on all variants, their sub-lineage, and mutations.

AB  - Background:
Excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with those expected from historical trends have been unequally distributed, both geographically and socioeconomically. Not all excess deaths have been directly related to COVID-19 infection. We investigated geographical and socioeconomic patterns in excess deaths for major groups of underlying causes during the pandemic.
Methods:
Weekly mortality data from 27/12/2014 to 2/10/2020 for England and Wales were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. Negative binomial regressions were used to model death counts based on pre-pandemic trends for deaths caused directly by COVID-19 (and other respiratory causes) and those caused indirectly by it (cardiovascular disease or diabetes, cancers, and all other indirect causes) over the first 30 weeks of the pandemic (7/3/2020–2/10/2020).
Findings:
There were 62,321 (95% CI: 58,849 to 65,793) excess deaths in England and Wales in the first 30 weeks of the pandemic. Of these, 46,221 (95% CI: 45,439 to 47,003) were attributable to respiratory causes, including COVID-19, and 16,100 (95% CI: 13,410 to 18,790) to other causes. Rates of all-cause excess mortality ranged from 78 per 100,000 in the South West of England and in Wales to 130 per 100,000 in the West Midlands; and from 93 per 100,000 in the most affluent fifth of areas to 124 per 100,000 in the most deprived. The most deprived areas had the highest rates of death attributable to COVID-19 and other indirect deaths, but there was no socioeconomic gradient for excess deaths from cardiovascular disease/diabetes and cancer.
Interpretation:
During the first 30 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic there was significant geographic and socioeconomic variation in excess deaths for respiratory causes, but not for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Pandemic recovery plans, including vaccination programmes, should take account of individual characteristics including health, socioeconomic status and place of residence.

AB  - Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic evolved in 2 consecutive waves during 2020. Improvements in the management of COVID-19 led to a reduction in mortality rates among hospitalized patients during the second wave. Whether this progress benefited kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), a population particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19, remained unclear.
Methods
In France, 957 KTRs were hospitalized for COVID-19 in 2020 and their data were prospectively collected into the French Solid Organ Transplant (SOT) COVID registry. The presentation, management, and outcomes of the 359 KTRs diagnosed during the first wave were compared to those of the 598 of the second wave.
Results
Baseline comorbidities were similar between KTRs of the 2 waves. Maintenance immunosuppression was reduced in most patients but withdrawal of antimetabolite (73.7% vs. 58.4%, P < 0.001) or calcineurin inhibitor (32.1% vs. 16.6%, P < 0.001) was less frequent during the second wave. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin that were commonly used during the first wave (21.7% and 30.9%, respectively) but were almost abandoned during the second wave. In contrast, the use of high dose corticosteroids doubled (19.5% vs. 41.6%, P < 0.001). Despite these changing trends in COVID-19 management, 60-day mortality was not statistically different between the 2 waves (25.3% vs. 23.9%; Log Rank, P = 0.48) and COVID-19 hospitalization period was not associated with death due to COVID-19 in multivariate analysis (Hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.67–1.17, P = 0.4).
Conclusion
We conclude that changing of therapeutic trends during 2020 did not reduce COVID-19 related mortality among KTRs. Our data indirectly support the importance of vaccination and neutralizing monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to protect KTRS from severe COVID-19.

AB  - Objective
We aimed to determine the influence of vaccination and air temperature on COVID-19 transmission and severity.
Methods
The study data in 146 countries from January 6, 2020 to July 28, 2022 were aggregated into 19,856 weeks. Country-level weekly incidence, time-varying reproduction number (Rt), mortality, and infection–fatality ratio (IFR) were compared among groups of these weeks with different vaccination rates and air temperatures.
Results
Weeks with <15 °C air temperature and 60% vaccination showed the highest incidence (mean, 604; SD, 855; 95% CI, 553–656, unit, /100,000 persons; N = 1073) and the highest rate of weeks with >1 Rt (mean, 41.6%; SD, 1.49%; 95% CI, 39.2–45.2%; N = 1090), while weeks with >25 °C and <20% showed the lowest incidence (mean, 24; SD, 75; 95% CI, 22–26; N = 5805) and the lowest rate of weeks with >1 Rt (mean, 15.3%; SD, 0.461%; 95% CI, 14.2–16.2%; N = 6122). Mortality in weeks with <15 °C (mean, 2.1; SD, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.0–2.2, unit, /100,000 persons; N = 4365) was five times of the mortality in weeks with >25 °C (mean, 0.44; SD, 1; 95% CI, 0.41–0.46; N = 7741). IFR ranged between 2% and 2.6% (SD, 1.9%–2.4%; 95% CI, 2.0–2.7%) at < 20% vaccination level, 1.8% (SD, 2%–2.2%; 95% CI, 1.7–2.0%) at 20–60% vaccination level, and 0.7%–1% (SD, 1%–1.8%; 95% CI, 0.7–1.1%) at > 60% vaccination level and at all air temperatures (all P < 0.001).
Conclusions
Vaccination was insufficient to mitigate the transmission since the significantly elevated weekly incidence and >1 Rt rate in weeks with high vaccination, while IFR was reduced by high vaccination. Countries with long-term low air temperature were affected by high transmission and high mortality.

AB  - Whilst it is now widely recognised that routine immunisation (RI) was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and further so in 2021, the extent of continued interruptions in 2022 and/or rebounds to previous trends remains unclear. We modelled country-specific RI trends using validated estimates of national coverage from the World Health Organisation and United Nation Children’s Fund for 182 countries (accounting for > 97% of children globally), to project expected diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis-containing vaccine first-dose (DTP1), third-dose (DTP3) and measles-containing vaccine first-dose (MCV1) coverage for 2020–2022 based on pre-pandemic trends (from 2000 to 2019). We provide further evidence of peak pandemic immunisation disruption in 2021, followed by tentative recovery in 2022. We report a 3.4% (95 %CI: [2.5%; 4.4%]) decline in global DTP3 coverage in 2021 compared to 2000–2019 trends, from an expected 89.8% to reported 86.4%. This coverage gap reduced to a 2.7% (95 %CI: [1.8%; 3.6%]) decline in 2022, with reported coverage rising to 87.2%. Similar results were seen for DTP1 and MCV1. Whilst partial rebounds are encouraging, global coverage decline translates to a 17-year setback in RI to 2005 levels, and the majority of countries retain coverage at or lower than pre-pandemic levels. The Americas, Africa, and Asia were the most impacted regions; and low- and middle-income countries the most affected income groups. The number of annual Zero Dose (ZD) children – indicating those receiving no immunisations – increased from 12.1 million (M) globally in 2019 to a peak of 16.7 M in 2021, then reduced to 13.1 M in 2022. Overall, we estimate an excess of 8.8 M ZD children cumulatively in 2020–2022 compared to pre-pandemic levels. This work can be used as an objective baseline to inform future interventions to prioritise and target interventions, and facilitate catch-up of growing populations of under- and un-immunised children.

AB  - ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND
People with mental disorders and intellectual disabilities experience excess mortality compared with the general population. The impact of COVID-19 on exacerbating this, and in widening ethnic inequalities, is unclear.
METHODS
Prospective data (N=167,122) from a large mental healthcare provider in London, UK, with deaths from 2019 to 2020, used to assess age- and gender-standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) across nine psychiatric conditions (schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, affective disorders, somatoform/ neurotic disorders, personality disorders, learning disabilities, eating disorders, substance use disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, dementia) and by ethnicity.
FINDINGS
Prior to the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring COVID-19 a public health emergency on 30th January 2020, all-cause SMRs across all psychiatric cohorts were more than double the general population. By the second quarter of 2020, when the UK experienced substantial peaks in COVID-19 deaths, all-cause SMRs increased further, with COVID-19 SMRs elevated across all conditions (notably: learning disabilities: SMR: 9.24 (95% CI: 5.98-13.64), pervasive developmental disorders: 5.01 (95% CI: 2.40-9.20), eating disorders: 4.81 (95% CI: 1.56-11.22), schizophrenia-spectrum disorders: 3.26 (95% CI: 2.55-4.10), dementia: 3.82 (95% CI: 3.42, 4.25) personality disorders 4.58 (95% CI: 3.09-6.53)). Deaths from other causes remained at least double the population average over the whole year. Increased SMRs were similar across ethnic groups.
INTERPRETATION
People with mental disorders and intellectual disabilities were at a greater risk of deaths relative to the general population before, during and after the first peak of COVID-19 deaths, with similar risks by ethnicity. Mortality from non-COVID-19/ other causes was elevated before/ during the pandemic, with higher COVID-19 mortality during the pandemic.

AB  - Summary
Background
Because evidence on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in older adults is scarce, we aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk of adverse events after CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech) vaccination in adults aged 60 years or older.
Methods
In this modified self-controlled case series, we enrolled adults aged 60 years or older who had received at least one dose of CoronaVac in Hong Kong between Feb 23, 2021, and Jan 31, 2022. We extracted population-based, electronic health record data from the clinical management system of the Hospital Authority on adverse events of special interest (from Jan 1, 2005, to Feb 23, 2022) and patients' demographic information (from Jan 1, 2018, to Jan 31, 2022), previous diagnoses (from Jan 1, 2018, to Jan 31, 2022), medication history (from Jan 1, 2018, to Jan 31, 2022), and laboratory tests, including those for SARS-CoV-2 infection (from Jan 1, 2018, to Jan 31, 2022). Details of vaccination status were provided by the Department of Health of the Hong Kong Government and were linked to data from the Hospital Authority with identity card numbers or passport numbers. Our outcomes were the overall incidence of any adverse event of special interest and the incidence rates of 30 adverse events of special interest, as suggested by the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, in the inpatient setting within 21 days (2 days for anaphylaxis) of either the first, second, or third CoronaVac dose compared with a baseline period. Individuals who had a history of a particular event between Jan 1, 2005, and Feb 23, 2021, were excluded from the corresponding analysis. We evaluated the risk of an adverse event of special interest using conditional Poisson regression, adjusting for seasonal effects.
Findings
Of 1 253 497 individuals who received at least one dose of CoronaVac during the study period, 622 317 (49·6%) were aged at least 60 years and were included in the analysis. Our analysis sample received 1 229 423 doses of CoronaVac and had a mean age of 70·40 years (SD 8·10). 293 086 (47·1%) of 622 317 participants were men and 329 231 (52·9%) were women. The incidence of individual adverse events of interest ranged from 0·00 per 100 000 people to 57·49 per 100 000 people (thromboembolism). The first and third doses of CoronaVac were not associated with a significant excess risk of an adverse event of special interest within 21 days (or 2 days for anaphylaxis) of vaccination. After the second dose, the only significantly increased risk was for anaphylaxis (adjusted incidence rate ratio 2·61, 95% CI 1·08–6·31; risk difference per 100 000 people 0·61, 95% CI 0·03–1·81).
Interpretation
Because older age is associated with poor outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the benefits of CoronaVac vaccination in older adults outweigh the risks in regions where COVID-19 is prevalent. Ongoing monitoring of vaccine safety is warranted.

AB  - Summary
Background
COVID-19 has been shown to differently affect various demographic and clinical population subgroups. We aimed to describe trends in absolute and relative COVID-19-related mortality risks across clinical and demographic population subgroups during successive SARS-CoV-2 pandemic waves.
Methods
We did a retrospective cohort study in England using the OpenSAFELY platform with the approval of National Health Service England, covering the first five SARS-CoV-2 pandemic waves (wave one [wild-type] from March 23 to May 30, 2020; wave two [alpha (B.1.1.7)] from Sept 7, 2020, to April 24, 2021; wave three [delta (B.1.617.2)] from May 28 to Dec 14, 2021; wave four [omicron (B.1.1.529)] from Dec 15, 2021, to April 29, 2022; and wave five [omicron] from June 24 to Aug 3, 2022). In each wave, we included people aged 18–110 years who were registered with a general practice on the first day of the wave and who had at least 3 months of continuous general practice registration up to this date. We estimated crude and sex-standardised and age-standardised wave-specific COVID-19-related death rates and relative risks of COVID-19-related death in population subgroups.
Findings
18 895 870 adults were included in wave one, 19 014 720 in wave two, 18 932 050 in wave three, 19 097 970 in wave four, and 19 226 475 in wave five. Crude COVID-19-related death rates per 1000 person-years decreased from 4·48 deaths (95% CI 4·41–4·55) in wave one to 2·69 (2·66–2·72) in wave two, 0·64 (0·63–0·66) in wave three, 1·01 (0·99–1·03) in wave four, and 0·67 (0·64–0·71) in wave five. In wave one, the standardised COVID-19-related death rates were highest in people aged 80 years or older, people with chronic kidney disease stage 5 or 4, people receiving dialysis, people with dementia or learning disability, and people who had received a kidney transplant (ranging from 19·85 deaths per 1000 person-years to 44·41 deaths per 1000 person-years, compared with from 0·05 deaths per 1000 person-years to 15·93 deaths per 1000 person-years in other subgroups). In wave two compared with wave one, in a largely unvaccinated population, the decrease in COVID-19-related mortality was evenly distributed across population subgroups. In wave three compared with wave one, larger decreases in COVID-19-related death rates were seen in groups prioritised for primary SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, including people aged 80 years or older and people with neurological disease, learning disability, or severe mental illness (90–91% decrease). Conversely, smaller decreases in COVID-19-related death rates were observed in younger age groups, people who had received organ transplants, and people with chronic kidney disease, haematological malignancies, or immunosuppressive conditions (0–25% decrease). In wave four compared with wave one, the decrease in COVID-19-related death rates was smaller in groups with lower vaccination coverage (including younger age groups) and conditions associated with impaired vaccine response, including people who had received organ transplants and people with immunosuppressive conditions (26–61% decrease).
Interpretation
There was a substantial decrease in absolute COVID-19-related death rates over time in the overall population, but demographic and clinical relative risk profiles persisted and worsened for people with lower vaccination coverage or impaired immune response. Our findings provide an evidence base to inform UK public health policy for protecting these vulnerable population subgroups.

AB  - Despite concerted efforts by health authorities worldwide to contain COVID-19, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has continued to spread and mutate into new variants with uncertain transmission characteristics. Therefore, there is a need for new data-driven models for determining optimal vaccination strategies that adapt to the new variants with their uncertain transmission characteristics. Motivated by this challenge, we derive an integrated chance constraints stochastic programming (ICC-SP) approach for finding vaccination strategies for epidemics that incorporates population demographics for any region of the world, uncertain disease transmission and vaccine efficacy. An optimal vaccination strategy specifies the proportion of individuals in a given household-type to vaccinate to bring the reproduction number to below one. The ICC-SP approach provides a quantitative method that allows to bound the expected excess of the reproduction number above one by an acceptable amount according to the decision-maker’s level of risk. This new methodology involves a multi-community household based epidemiology model that uses census demographics data, vaccination status, age-related heterogeneity in disease susceptibility and infectivity, virus variants, and vaccine efficacy. The new methodology was tested on real data for seven neighboring counties in the United States state of Texas. The results are promising and show, among other findings, that vaccination strategies for controlling an outbreak should prioritize vaccinating certain household sizes as well as age groups with relatively high combined susceptibility and infectivity.

AB  - There is a strong coordinated effort by vaccination groups all over the world to put an end to the current crisis of COVID-19. Now sufficient data are available to analyse and compare some results to explore the aftereffects of vaccination. Some influence variables on transmissions of the disease were discussed e.g., mass vaccination, lockdown and seasonality. Most studies covered here are up to the beginning of July 2022, while some analyses focused on the earlier period of mass vaccination. Well established, simple statistical techniques to evaluate results were presented those used open data sources of authoritative bodies. Some comparisons between vaccinated vs. unvaccinated were also discussed based on data from UK Government Health Security Agency (UHSA). In terms of mass vaccination, adverse reactions after vaccination received attention, as health and safety issues of the general public are of prime importance. Apart from direct side effects, the secondary effect of mass vaccination needs attention too. After the initiation of the vaccination programme, almost all countries experienced a sudden surge in transmission and most countries had to impose strict lockdown measures. Many countries, with a low prevalence of disease, suddenly showed a steep jump and some countries even followed a synchronized pattern between the rate of transmissions and the variation of vaccine doses. Time series analyses and bar diagram presentations were able to capture those features. In that context, fast mutation of the virus and new variants after mass vaccination and possible mechanisms/consequences were also attended. To understand the effect of seasonality, similarities between COVID-19 and the seasonal Flu are discussed for Europe and US to gain useful insight. Using time series analyses and spatial plots of regional temperature composites we showed, like Flu, seasonality played a dominant role in transmissions of COVID-19 in the Europe. Regulations of vaccine dose and policy implication were explored too. From 22nd December 2021, global vaccine doses were reduced substantially, which followed a dramatic reduction in cases and thereafter deaths with around one month's lag between each. As strong dependency on seasonality is noticed in certain countries and observing that regulation of vaccine doses has roles in modulating the transmission with certain lags, globally as well as regionally, our results have policy implications for the management of COVID. Debating, questioning and criticism are always the foundation of great science and the major pillars of its progress. Following that objective, it is an effort to explore pragmatically, supported by scientific analyses, areas relating to the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine and the exit strategy via the pathway of vaccination.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) is a potent immunogenic adjuvant and epitope display platform for the development of vaccines against cancers and infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019. However, the proteinaceous CPMV nanoparticles are rapidly degraded in vivo. Multiple doses are therefore required to ensure long-lasting immunity, which is not ideal for global mass vaccination campaigns. Therefore, we formulated CPMV nanoparticles in injectable hydrogels to achieve slow particle release and prolonged immunostimulation. Liquid formulations were prepared from chitosan and glycerophosphate (GP) before homogenization with CPMV particles at room temperature. The formulations containing high-molecular-weight chitosan and 0–4.5 mg mL–1 CPMV gelled rapidly at 37°C (5–8 min) and slowly released cyanine 5-CPMV particles in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, when a hydrogel containing CPMV displaying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein epitope 826 (amino acid 809–826) was administered to mice as a single subcutaneous injection, it elicited an antibody response that was sustained over 20 weeks, with an associated shift from Th1 to Th2 bias. Antibody titers were improved at later time points (weeks 16 and 20) comparing the hydrogel versus soluble vaccine candidates; furthermore, the soluble vaccine candidates retained Th1 bias. We conclude that CPMV nanoparticles can be formulated effectively in chitosan/GP hydrogels and are released as intact particles for several months with conserved immunotherapeutic efficacy. The injectable hydrogel containing epitope-labeled CPMV offers a promising single-dose vaccine platform for the prevention of future pandemics as well as a strategy to develop long-lasting plant virus-based nanomedicines.

AB  - Given the scarcity of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, a chief policy question is how to allocate them among different sociodemographic groups. This paper evaluates COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies proposed to date, focusing on their stated goals; the mechanisms through which the selected allocations affect the course and burden of the pandemic; and the main epidemiological, economic, logistical, and political issues that arise when setting the prioritization strategy. The paper uses a simple, age-stratified susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered model applied to the United States to quantitatively assess the performance of alternative prioritization strategies with respect to avoided deaths, avoided infections, and life-years gained. We demonstrate that prioritizing essential workers is a viable strategy for reducing the number of cases and years of life lost, while the largest reduction in deaths is achieved by prioritizing older adults in most scenarios, even if the vaccine is effective at blocking viral transmission. Uncertainty regarding this property and potential delays in dose delivery reinforce the call for prioritizing older adults. Additionally, we investigate the strength of the equity motive that would support an allocation strategy attaching absolute priority to essential workers for a vaccine that reduces infection-fatality risk.

AB  - A growing number of studies report associations between air pollution and COVID-19 mortality. Most were ecological studies at the county or regional level which disregard important local variability and relied on data from only the first few months of the pandemic. Using COVID-19 deaths identified from death certificates in California, we evaluated whether long-term ambient air pollution was related to weekly COVID-19 mortality at the census tract-level during the first ∼12 months of the pandemic. Weekly COVID-19 mortality for each census tract was calculated based on geocoded death certificate data. Annual average concentrations of ambient particulate matter <2.5 μm (PM2.5) and <10 μm (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) over 2014–2019 were assessed for all census tracts using inverse distance-squared weighting based on data from the ambient air quality monitoring system. Negative binomial mixed models related weekly census tract COVID-19 mortality counts to a natural cubic spline for calendar week. We included adjustments for potential confounders (census tract demographic and socioeconomic factors), random effects for census tract and county, and an offset for census tract population. Data were analyzed as two study periods: Spring/Summer (March 16-October 18, 2020) and Winter (October 19, 2020–March 7, 2021). Mean (standard deviation) concentrations were 10.3 (2.1) μg/m3 for PM2.5, 25.5 (7.1) μg/m3 for PM10, 11.3 (4.0) ppb for NO2, and 42.8 (6.9) ppb for O3. For Spring/Summer, adjusted rate ratios per standard deviation increase were 1.13 (95% confidence interval: 1.09, 1.17) for PM2.5, 1.16 (1.11, 1.21) for PM10, 1.06 (1.02, 1.10) for NO2, and 1.09 (1.04, 1.14) for O3. Associations were replicated in Winter, although they were attenuated for PM2.5 and PM10. Study findings support a relation between long-term ambient air pollution exposure and COVID-19 mortality. Communities with historically high pollution levels might be at higher risk of COVID-19 mortality.

AB  - Summary
Measles vaccine (MV) has been observed to reduce all-cause mortality more than explained by prevention of measles infection. Recently, prevention of “measles-induced immune amnesia” (MIA) has been proposed as an explanation for this larger-than-anticipated beneficial effect of measles vaccine (MV). According to the “MIA hypothesis”, immune amnesia leads to excess non-measles morbidity and mortality, that may last up to five years after measles infection, but may be prevented by MV. However, the benefits of MV-vaccinated children could also be due to beneficial non-specific effects (NSEs) of MV, reducing the risk of non-measles infections (The “NSE hypothesis"). The epidemiological studies do provide some support for MIA, as exposure to measles infection before 6 months of age causes long-term MIA, and over 6 months of age for 2–3 months. However, in children over 6 months of age, the MIA hypothesis is contradicted by several epidemiological patterns: First, in community studies that adjusted for MV status, children surviving acute measles infection had lower mortality than uninfected controls (44%(95%CI: 0–69%)). Second, in six randomised trials and six observational studies comparing MV-vaccinated and MV-unvaccinated children, the benefit of MV changed minimally from 54%(43–63%) to 49%(37–59%) when measles cases were censored in the survival analysis, making it unlikely that prevention of measles and its long-term consequences explained much of the reduced mortality. Third, several studies conducted in measles-free contexts still showed significantly lower mortality after MV (55%(40–67%)). Fourth, administration of MV in the presence of maternal measles antibody (MatAb) is associated with much stronger beneficial effect for child survival than administration of MV in the absence of MatAb (55%(35–68%) lower mortality). The MIA hypothesis alone cannot explain the strongly beneficial effects of MV on child survival. Conversely, the hypothesis that MV has beneficial non-specific immune training effects is compatible with all available data. Consideration should be given to continuing MV even when measles has been eradicated.

AB  - Background
Migrant populations in high-income countries have faced myriad health and social inequities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Migrants often work in frontline essential services that expose them to COVID-19. Migrant workers in meat processing plants have endured large COVID-19 outbreaks across multiple countries.
Objectives
We examine current scientific evidence around COVID-19 transmission, outcomes, and prevention for migrant workers and highlight meat processing plants as an example.
Sources
We performed a series of PubMed searches between January 1, 2020 and January 12, 2022.
Content
Migrant workers in high-income countries often work in occupations at high risk for COVID-19 transmission, contract COVID-19 at higher rates, and experience worse outcomes than native-born counterparts. For example, meat processing plants represent almost ideal environments for rapid and large-scale SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission; often, large migrant workforces confined to small workspaces perform physically demanding work in noisy environments that require shouting to communicate, increasing workers' respiratory rates and the quantity of aerosolized droplets expelled and thus increasing viral transmission risk. Although enhanced vaccination outreach programs remain an important equity approach for migrant worker safety, they alone are insufficient. The emergence and rapid spread of multiple increasingly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with variable vaccine escape properties, including Omicron in November 2021, highlight the importance of improved infection prevention and control strategies to protect migrant workers. Across countries, strategies such as improving ventilation and mask quality in many high-risk occupational settings are already required by employment law. Universal mandatory vaccination program should also be considered.
Implications
COVID-19 transmission prevention for migrant workers requires an aggressive multicomponent plan that includes (a) improved on-site ventilation and infection prevention and control strategies; (b) improved social supports such as paid sick leave; (c) mobile vaccination clinics and community engagement to overcome vaccine hesitancy and barriers; and (d) consideration of universal mandatory vaccination programs.

AB  - Objectives
To identify the associations of temperature with non-COVID-19 mortality and all-cause mortality in the pandemic 2020 in comparison with the non-COVID-19 period in Italy.
Methods
The data on 3,189,790 all-cause deaths (including 3,134,137 non-COVID-19 deaths) and meteorological conditions in 107 Italian provinces between February 1st and November 30th in each year of 2015–2020 were collected. We employed a time-stratified case-crossover study design combined with the distributed lag non-linear model to investigate the relationships of temperature with all-cause and non-COVID-19 mortality in the pandemic and non-pandemic periods.
Results
Cold temperature exposure contributed higher risks for both all-cause and non-COVID-19 mortality in the pandemic period in 2020 than in 2015–2019. However, no different change was found for the impacts of heat. The relative risk (RR) of non-COVID-19 deaths and all-cause mortality at extremely cold (2 °C) in comparison with the estimated minimum mortality temperature (19 °C) in 2020 were 1.63 (95% CI: 1.55–1.72) and 1.45 (95%CI: 1.31–1.61) respectively, which were higher than all-cause mortality risk in 2015–2019 with RR of 1.19 (95%CI: 1.17–1.21).
Conclusion
Cold exposure indicated stronger impacts than high temperatures on all-cause and non-COVID-19 mortality in the pandemic year 2020 compared to its counterpart period in 2015–2019 in Italy.
