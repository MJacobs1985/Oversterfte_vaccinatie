AB  - COVID-19-infected individuals and those who recovered from the infection have been demonstrated to have elevated liver enzymes or abnormal liver biochemistries, particularly with preexisting liver diseases, liver metabolic disorders, viral hepatitis, and other hepatic comorbidities. However, possible crosstalk and intricate interplay between COVID-19 and liver disease severity are still elusive, and the available data are murky and confined. Similarly, the syndemic of other blood-borne infectious diseases, chemical-induced liver injuries, and chronic hepatic diseases continued to take lives while showing signs of worsening due to the COVID-19 crisis. Moreover, the pandemic is not over yet and is transitioning to becoming an epidemic in recent years; hence, monitoring liver function tests (LFTs) and assessing hepatic consequences of COVID-19 in patients with or without liver illnesses would be of paramount interest. This pragmatic review explores the correlations between COVID-19 and liver disease severity based on abnormal liver biochemistries and other possible mechanisms in individuals of all ages from the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic to the post-pandemic period. The review also alludes to clinical perspectives of such interactions to curb overlapping hepatic diseases in people who recovered from the infection or living with long COVID-19.

AB  - Objectives
Evaluating whether meteorological and geographical variables could be associated with the severity of COVID-19 in Spain.
Methods
An ecological study was performed to analyze the influence of meteorological and geographical factors in hospital admissions and deaths due to COVID-19 in the 52 provinces of Spain (24 coastal and 28 inland regions), during the first three pandemic waves. Medical and mortality data were collected from the Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII) and meteorological variables were requested to the Spanish State Meteorological Agency (AEMET).
Results
Regarding the diagnosed cases it is remarkable that the percentage of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was lower in the coastal provinces than in the inland ones (8.7±2.6% vs. 11.5±2.6%; p=9.9×10−5). Furthermore, coastal regions registered a lower percentage of mortality than inland regions (2.0±0.6% vs. 3.1±0.8%; p=1.7×10−5). Mean air temperature was inversely correlated both with COVID-19 hospitalizations (Rho: −0.59; p=3.0×10-6) and mortality (Rho: −0.70; p=5.3×10−9). In those provinces with a mean air temperature <10°C mortality by COVID-19 was twice that of those with >16°C. Finally, we found an association between mortality and the location of the province (coastal/inland), altitude, patient age and the average air temperature; the latter was inversely and independently correlated with mortality (non standardised B coeff.: −0.24; IC 95%: −0.31 to −0.16; p=2.38×10−8).
Conclusions
The average air temperature was inversely associated with COVID-19 mortality in our country during the first three waves of the pandemic.
Resumen
Objetivos
Evaluar si factores meteorológicos y geográficos pudieron relacionarse con la gravedad de la COVID-19 en España.
Métodos
Estudio ecológico, a escala provincial, que analiza la influencia de factores meteorológicos y geográficos en la hospitalización y mortalidad por COVID-19 en las 52 provincias españolas (24 costeras y 28 del interior), durante las tres primeras olas. Los datos de hospitalizaciones y mortalidad se obtuvieron del Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII). Los datos epidemiológicos del Instituto Nacional Estadística (INE) y la Red Nacional de Vigilancia Epidemiológica (RENAVE). Las variables meteorológicas de la Agencia estatal de meteorología (AEMET).
Resultados
El porcentaje de pacientes hospitalizados por COVID-19, del total de personas infectadas, fue inferior en las provincias costeras que en las del interior peninsular (8,7±2,6% vs. 11,5±2,6%; p=9,9×10−5). De igual manera la costa registró menor porcentaje de mortalidad que el interior peninsular (2,0±0,6% vs. 3,1±0,8%; p=1,7×10−5). La temperatura media correlacionó negativamente con la hospitalización (Rho: −0,59; p=3,0×10−6) y la mortalidad por COVID-19 (Rho: −0,70; p=5,3×10−9). Las provincias con una temperatura media <10°C duplicaron la mortalidad por COVID respecto a las de >16°C. La mortalidad se relacionó con la localización provincial (costa/interior), la altitud, la edad de la población y la temperatura media, siendo esta última la variable asociada de manera independiente (Coef. B no estandarizado: −0,24; IC 95%: −0,31 a −0,16; p=2,38×10−8).
Conclusiones
La mortalidad por COVID-19 durante las tres primeras olas de la pandemia en nuestro país se asoció inversamente con la temperatura media.

AB  - Despite a recent endorsement from official and professional bodies unequivocally recommending COVID-19 vaccination, vaccine hesitancy among pregnant people remains high. The accumulated evidence demonstrates that pregnant people are a special risk group for COVID-19, with an increased risk of intensive care unit admission, extracorporeal membranous oxygenation requirement, preterm birth, and perinatal death. These risks are further increased with some variants of concern, and vaccination of pregnant people reduces the COVID-19–related increase in maternal or fetal morbidity. Data from more than 180,000 vaccinated persons show that immunization against COVID-19 with an mRNA vaccine is safe for pregnant people. Many observational studies comparing perinatal outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant people have had reassuring findings and did not demonstrate harmful effects on pregnancy or the newborn. Immunization with mRNA vaccines does not increase the risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, low birthweight, maternal or neonatal intensive care unit admission, fetal death, fetal abnormality, or pulmonary embolism. Moreover, observational data corroborate the findings of randomized trials that mRNA vaccination is highly effective at preventing severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant people, emphasizing that the potential maternal and fetal benefits of vaccination greatly outweigh the potential risks of vaccination. Ensuring pregnant people have unrestricted access to COVID-19 vaccination should be a priority in every country worldwide.

AB  - Purpose
The COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat with a devastating impact on health, economy, and society in general. The objective of this study was to assess the clinical and economic value of remdesivir by developing a cost-effectiveness analysis model for hospitalized adults with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen in Greece.
Methods
A cost-effectiveness model was developed that included a decision tree model and a Markov cohort model. Clinical effectiveness data for remdesivir were derived from a network meta-analysis. Health care resource use, current clinical practice, and cost data were derived from published literature. Both clinical and cost-effectiveness outcomes were assessed from a Greek health care payer perspective.
Findings
Treatment with remdesivir led to 1.45 more life-years and 1.11 quality-adjusted life-years gained compared with standard of care alone. In addition, treatment with remdesivir resulted in fewer days in the hospital per patient (0.87, 1.49, and 1.37 fewer days in the general ward, intensive care unit, and intensive care unit with mechanical invasive ventilation, respectively) than patients treated only with standard of care, as well as with lower hospital bed occupancy rates and fewer deaths. Treatment with remdesivir was also related to cost savings for the Greek health care system, making remdesivir a dominant intervention.
Implications
This study provides good evidence for policymakers on the economic value of remdesivir as a treatment strategy for hospitalized patients moderately and severely infected by the virus who require supplemental oxygen. The results support the use of remdesivir as a first-line antiviral treatment option for hospitalized patients in the Greek national COVID-19 treatment algorithm. However, the model does not incorporate estimates on possible additional hospitalizations or rehabilitations, long-term adverse effects of COVID-19, adverse events of remdesivir, or indirect costs of the disease. Therefore, further research is needed to fully evaluate the cost-effectiveness and clinical implications of the use of remdesivir in treating patients with COVID-19 in Greece.

AB  - Introduction
Despite ongoing efforts to vaccinate communities against COVID-19, the necessity of face mask use in controlling the pandemic remains subject to debate. Several studies have investigated face masks and COVID-19, covering smaller and less diverse populations than this study's sample. This study examines a hypothesized association of face-covering mandates with COVID-19 mortality decline across 44 countries in 2 continents.
Methods
In a retrospective cohort study, changes in COVID-19‒related daily mortality rate per million population from February 15 to May 31, 2020 were compared between 27 countries with and 17 countries without face mask mandates in nearly 1 billion (911,446,220 total) people. Longitudinal mixed effect modeling was applied and adjusted for over 10 relevant demographic, social, clinical, and time-dependent confounders.
Results
Average COVID-19 mortality per million was 288.54 in countries without face mask policies and 48.40 in countries with face mask policies. In no mask countries, adjusted average daily increase was 0.1553 − 0.0017 X (days since the first case) log deaths per million, compared with 0.0900 − 0.0009 X (days since the first case) log deaths per million in the countries with a mandate. A total of 60 days into the pandemic, countries without face mask mandates had an average daily increase of 0.0533 deaths per million, compared with the average daily increase of 0.0360 deaths per million for countries with face mask mandates.
Conclusions
This study's significant results show that face mask mandates were associated with lower COVID-19 deaths rates than the rates in countries without mandates. These findings support the use of face masks to prevent excess COVID-19 deaths and should be advised during airborne disease epidemics.

AB  - Summary
Objective
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic. This systematic review compares mortality risk factors including clinical, demographic and laboratory features of COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The aim is to provide new strategies for COVID-19 prevention and treatment.
Methods
We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis, using five databases to compare the predictors of death for COVID-19, SARS and MERS. A random-effects model meta-analysis calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
Results
845 articles up through 11/4/2020 were retrieved, but only 28 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that males had a higher likelihood of death than females (OR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.56–2.13). Age (OR = 7.86, 95% CI 5.46–11.29), diabetes comorbidity (OR = 3.73, 95% CI 2.35–5.90), chronic lung disease (OR = 3.43, 95% CI 1.80–6.52) and hypertension (OR = 3.38, 95% CI 2.45–4.67) were the mortality risk factors. The laboratory indicators lactic dehydrogenase (OR = 37.52, 95% CI 24.68–57.03), C-reactive protein (OR = 12.11, 95% CI 5.24–27.98), and neutrophils (OR = 17.56, 95% CI 10.67–28.90) had stronger correlations with COVID-19 mortality than with SARS or MERS mortality. Consolidation and ground-glass opacity imaging features were similar among COVID-19, SARS, and MERS patients.
Conclusions
COVID-19′s mortality factors are similar to those of SARS and MERS. Age and laboratory indicators could be effective predictors of COVID-19 mortality outcomes.

AB  - Summary
Background
Preoperative COVID-19 has been associated with excess postoperative morbi-mortality. Consequently, guidelines were developed that recommended the postponement of surgery for at least 7 weeks after the infection. We hypothesised that vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 and the large predominance of the Omicron variant attenuated the effect of a preoperative COVID-19 on the occurrence of postoperative respiratory morbidity.
Methods
We conducted a prospective cohort study in 41 French centres between 15 March and 30 May 2022 (ClinicalTrials NCT05336110), aimed at comparing the postoperative respiratory morbidity between patients with and without preoperative COVID-19 within 8 weeks prior to surgery. The primary outcome was a composite outcome combining the occurrence of pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, unexpected mechanical ventilation, and pulmonary embolism within the first 30 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, hospital length-of-stay, readmissions, and non-respiratory infections. The sample size was determined to have 90% power to identify a doubling of the primary outcome rate. Adjusted analyses were performed using propensity score modelling and inverse probability weighting.
Findings
Of the 4928 patients assessed for the primary outcome, of whom 92.4% were vaccinated against the SARS-CoV-2, 705 had preoperative COVID-19. The primary outcome was reported in 140 (2.8%) patients. An 8-week preoperative COVID-19 was not associated with increased postoperative respiratory morbidity (odds ratio 1.08 [95% CI 0.48–2.13]; p = 0.83). None of the secondary outcomes differed between the two groups. Sensitivity analyses concerning the timing between COVID-19 and surgery, and the clinical presentations of preoperative COVID-19 did not show any association with the primary outcome, except for COVID-19 patients with ongoing symptoms the day of surgery (OR 4.29 [1.02–15.8]; p = 0.04).
Interpretation
In our Omicron-predominant, highly immunised population undergoing general surgery, a preoperative COVID-19 was not associated with increased postoperative respiratory morbidity.
Funding
The study was fully funded by the French Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (SFAR).

AB  - Since its global invasion in 2019, COVID-19 has affected several aspects of patients’ lives and posed a significant impact on the health care system. Several patient populations were identified to be at high risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or developing severe COVID-19-related sequelae. Conversely, anyone who has contracted SARS-CoV-2 is at risk to experience symptoms and signs consistent with post-COVID manifestations. Patients with asthma were initially thought to be at increased risk and severity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, accumulating evidence demonstrates that asthma endotypes/phenotypes and comorbidities influence the risk stratification in this population. Furthermore, initial concerns about the potentially increased risk of poor outcomes with asthma treatments such as inhaled corticosteroids and biologics have not been substantiated. In this review, we provide an update on COVID-19 and asthma, including risk of susceptibility, clinical manifestations and course in this population as well as discuss recommendations for management.

AB  - Summary
Background
Understanding mortality burden associated with communicable diseases is key to informing resource allocation, disease prevention and control efforts, and evaluating public health interventions. We quantified excess mortality among people notified with communicable diseases in Victoria, Australia.
Methods
Cases of communicable disease notified in Victoria between 1 January 1991 and 31 December 2021 were linked to the death registry. Informational gain obtained through linkage and 30-day case fatality rates were calculated for each disease. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated up to a year following illness onset.
Findings
There were 1,032,619 cases and 5985 (0.58%) died ≤30 days of illness onset. Following linkage, the 30-day case fatality rate increased more than 2-fold. Diseases with high 7-day SMR signifying excess mortality included invasive pneumococcal disease (167.7, 95% CI 153.4–182.7); listeriosis (166.2, 95% CI 121.2–218.3); invasive meningococcal disease (145.9, 95% CI 116.7–178.3); legionellosis (43.3, 95% CI 28.0–62.0); and COVID-19 (21.9, 95% CI 19.7–24.3). Most diseases exhibited a strong negative gradient, with high SMRs in the first 7-days of illness onset that reduced over time.
Interpretation
We demonstrated that the rate of death in Victoria's notifiable disease surveillance dataset is underestimated. Further, compared to a general population, there is evidence of elevated all-cause mortality among people notified with communicable diseases often up to one year following illness onset. Not all elevated risk is likely directly attributable to the communicable diseases of interest, rather, it may reflect underlying comorbidities or behaviours in these individuals. Regardless of attribution, infection with communicable diseases may represent a marker of mortality. Key to preventing deaths may be through timely and appropriate transition to primary and preventive healthcare following diagnosis.

AB  - Obesity is strongly and independently associated with an increased risk of severe illness and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The pathophysiological changes that result from elevated body weight lead to metabolic dysfunction, chronic inflammation, impaired immunological responses, and multisystem disorders, which increase vulnerability to severe illness from COVID-19. While vaccination strategies are under way across the world, the second and third waves of the pandemic, along with the emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strains, continue to threaten the stability of medical systems worldwide. Furthermore, evidence from previous pandemics suggests that vaccines are less effective in obese individuals than in their healthy-weight counterparts over the long term. Therefore, a consideration of lifestyle changes that can boost metabolic health and immunity is critical to reduce the risk of complications and severe illness from viral infection. In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms linking excess body weight with COVID-19 morbidity. We also present evidence that intermittent fasting (IF), a dietary program that has gained popularity in recent years, may be an effective strategy to improve metabolic health and immunity and thus reduce the impact of obesity on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Background
Elderly patients represent a high-risk group with increased risk of death from COVID-19. Despite the number of published studies, several unmet needs in care for older adults exist.
Objectives
To discuss unmet needs of COVID-19 in this special population.
Sources
A literature review for studies on COVID-19 in elderly patients published between December 2019 and November 2021 was performed. Clinical questions were formulated to guide the literature search. The search was conducted in the MEDLINE database, combining specific search terms. Two reviewers independently conducted the search and selected the studies according to the prespecified clinical questions.
Content
Elderly patients with COVID-19 have peculiar characteristics. They may have atypical clinical presentation, with no fever and with delirium or neurological manifestations as the most common signs, with potential delayed diagnosis and increased risk of death. The reported fatality rates among elderly patients with COVID-19 are extremely high. Several factors, including comorbidities, atypical presentation, and exclusion from intensive care unit care, contribute to this excess of mortality. Age alone is frequently used as a key factor to exclude the elderly from intensive care, but there is evidence that frailty rather than age better predicts the risk of poor outcome in this category. Durability of vaccine efficacy in the elderly remains debated, and the need for a third booster dose is becoming increasingly evident. Finally, efforts to care for elderly patients who have survived after acute COVID-19 should be implemented, considering the high rates of long COVID sequelae and the risk of longitudinal functional and cognitive decline.
Implications
We highlight peculiar aspects of COVID-19 in elderly patients and factors contributing to high risk of poor outcome in this category. We also illuminated gaps in current evidence, suggesting future research directions and underlining the need for further studies on the optimal management of elderly patients with COVID-19.

AB  - In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adult heart transplantation. We highlight the decline in the number of adult transplantations performed throughout the pandemic as a consequence of restrictions imposed on individual programs and hospitals. There were challenges to maintaining cardiac transplant activity at multiple levels, including organ donation in intensive care units, logistical difficulties with organ procurement, and rapidly changing resource considerations at health system and jurisdictional levels. We also review the impact of COVID-19 on cardiac transplant recipients. Despite the high rates of morbidity and mortality observed during the initial phases of the pandemic among heart transplant patients infected with COVID-19, the availability of effective vaccines, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and specific antiviral therapies have drastically improved outcomes over time. Vaccines have proven to be safe and effective in reducing infections and illness severity, but specific considerations in the immunocompromised solid organ transplant population apply, including the need for additional booster doses to achieve sufficient immunisation. We further outline the strong rationale for vaccination before transplantation wherever possible. Finally, the COVID-19 response created a number of barriers to safe and efficient post-transplantation care. Given the need for frequent evaluation and monitoring, especially in the first several months after cardiac transplantation, the pandemic provided the impetus to improve virtual care delivery and explore noninvasive rejection surveillance through gene expression profiling. We hope that lessons learned will allow us to prepare and pivot effectively during future pandemics and health care emergencies.
Résumé
Dans cette revue, nous présentons une vue d’ensemble de l’influence de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur la transplantation cardiaque chez l’adulte. Nous soulignons la diminution du nombre de transplantations adultes réalisées tout au long de la pandémie en raison des restrictions imposées aux programmes individuels et aux hôpitaux. Le maintien de l’activité de transplantation cardiaque s’est heurté à de multiples difficultés, notamment le don d’organes dans les unités de soins intensifs, les problèmes logistiques liés à l’obtention des organes et l’évolution rapide des ressources au niveau des systèmes de santé et des juridictions. Nous examinons également l’incidence de la COVID-19 sur les transplantés cardiaques. Malgré les taux élevés de morbidité et de mortalité observés au cours des phases initiales de la pandémie chez les patients ayant subi une transplantation cardiaque et infectés par la COVID-19, la disponibilité de vaccins efficaces, d’une prophylaxie préexposition et de thérapies antivirales spécifiques a permis d’améliorer considérablement les résultats au fil du temps. Les vaccins se sont révélés sûrs et efficaces pour réduire les infections et la gravité de la maladie, mais des considérations spécifiques s’appliquent à la population immunosupprimée ayant subi une transplantation d’organe solide, notamment la nécessité d’administrer des doses de rappel supplémentaires pour parvenir à une immunisation suffisante. Nous soulignons en outre les arguments solides en faveur de la vaccination avant la transplantation, dans la mesure du possible. Enfin, la réponse à la COVID-19 a créé un certain nombre d’obstacles à l’innocuité et à l’efficacité des soins post-transplantation. Étant donné la nécessité d’une évaluation et d’un suivi fréquents, en particulier au cours des premiers mois suivant une transplantation cardiaque, la pandémie a donné l’élan nécessaire pour améliorer la prestation de soins virtuels et explorer la surveillance non invasive du rejet par l’entremise du profil d’expression génique. Nous espérons que les enseignements tirés nous permettront de nous préparer et de réagir efficacement lors de futures pandémies et urgences sanitaires.

AB  - Introduction
We investigated the potential association of COVID-19 vaccination with three acute neurological events: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), transverse myelitis and Bell’s palsy.
Methods
With the approval of NHS England we analysed primary care data from >17 million patients in England linked to emergency care, hospital admission and mortality records in the OpenSAFELY platform. Separately for each vaccine brand, we used a self-controlled case series design to estimate the incidence rate ratio for each outcome in the period following vaccination (4–42 days for GBS, 4–28 days for transverse myelitis and Bell’s palsy) compared to a within-person baseline, using conditional Poisson regression.
Results
Among 7,783,441 ChAdOx1 vaccinees, there was an increased rate of GBS (N = 517; incidence rate ratio 2·85; 95% CI2·33–3·47) and Bell’s palsy (N = 5,350; 1·39; 1·27–1·53) following a first dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine, corresponding to 11.0 additional cases of GBS and 17.9 cases of Bell’s palsy per 1 million vaccinees if causal. For GBS this applied to the first, but not the second, dose. There was no clear evidence of an association of ChAdOx1 vaccination with transverse myelitis (N = 199; 1·51; 0·96–2·37). Among 5,729,152 BNT162b2 vaccinees, there was no evidence of any association with GBS (N = 283; 1·09; 0·75–1·57), transverse myelitis (N = 109; 1·62; 0·86–3·03) or Bell’s palsy (N = 3,609; 0·89; 0·76–1·03). Among 255,446 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients there was no evidence of an association with Bell’s palsy (N = 78; 0·88, 0·32–2·42).
Conclusions
COVID-19 vaccines save lives, but it is important to understand rare adverse events. We observed a short-term increased rate of Guillain-Barré syndrome and Bell’s palsy after first dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine. The absolute risk, assuming a causal effect attributable to vaccination, was low.

AB  - Background
Before the advent of COVID-19 vaccines, hospitalizations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection during 2020 collapsed most medical centers worldwide. Disruptions in health care for clinical conditions other than COVID-19 were not uniform. Herein, we report the impact of COVID-19 on hospitalizations due to viral hepatitis in Spain.
Methods
Retrospective study of all hospitalizations in Spain during 10 months before (pre-pandemic period) and after (pandemic period) March 1st 2020. Admissions with a diagnosis of hepatitis B, C and/or delta were retrieved and compared using the Spanish National Registry of Hospital Discharges.
Results
Nationwide hospitalizations declined 14.6% during the pandemic period, from 3,144,164 to 2,684,845. This reduction was significantly more pronounced for admissions due to viral hepatitis (18.1% drop), falling from 46,521 to 38,115. During the pandemic period, patients admitted with viral hepatitis died significantly more frequently than during the pre-pandemic period (7.2% vs 6.1%; p < 0.001). Liver transplants significantly declined during the pandemic period. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 10.3% of patients hospitalized with viral hepatitis during the pandemic period. This subset of patients was older and died 2.4-fold more frequently than the rest, despite having advanced liver disease less frequently.
Conclusion
Hospitalizations due to viral hepatitis significantly declined in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients admitted with viral hepatitis experienced a greater mortality during the pandemic period. Deaths were more pronounced when coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 despite having advanced liver disease less frequently.

AB  - Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted governments internationally to consider strengthening their public health systems. To support the work of Ireland's Public Health Reform Expert Advisory Group, the Health Information and Quality Authority, an independent governmental agency, was asked to describe the lessons learnt regarding the public health response to COVID-19 internationally and the applicability of this response for future pandemic preparedness.
Methods
Semi-structured interviews with key public health representatives from nine countries were conducted. Interviews were conducted in March and April 2022 remotely via Zoom and were recorded. Notes were taken by two researchers, and a thematic analysis undertaken.
Results
Lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic related to three main themes: 1) setting policy; 2) delivering public health interventions; and 3) providing effective communication. Real-time surveillance, evidence synthesis, and cross-sectoral collaboration were reported as essential for policy setting; it was noted that having these functions established prior to the pandemic would lead to a more efficient implementation in a health emergency. Delivering public health interventions such as testing, contact tracing, and vaccination were key to limiting and or mitigating the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, a number of challenges were highlighted such as staff capacity and burnout, delays in vaccination procurement, and reduced delivery of regular healthcare services. Clear, consistent, and regular communication of the scientific evidence was key to engaging citizens with mitigation strategies. However, these communication strategies had to compete with an infodemic of information being circulated, particularly through social media.
Conclusions
Overall, functions relating to policy setting, public health interventions, and communication are key to pandemic response. Ideally, these should be established in the preparedness phase so that they can be rapidly scaled-up during a pandemic.

AB  - Background and aims
COVID-19 disease appear to have been associated with significant mortality amongst doctors and health care workers globally. We explore the various risk factors associated with this occupational risk, especially focusing on India. This may elucidate lessons to protect these frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
We carried out a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords such as ‘COVID-19’, ‘pandemics’, ‘physicians’ ‘mortality’ and ‘health personnel’ on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and ResearchGate in the month of July 2020 during the current COVID-19 pandemic and assessed mortality data.
Results
Mortality in health care professionals has been on the rise. The countries which faced the pandemic in the early months of 2020 have had a huge surge in mortality amongst doctors due to COVID-19. India continues to show a rising trend in COVID-19 cases, however although compared to the western world India has seen a comparatively favourable statistic. Male gender, elderly doctors and those belonging to Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) community seem to be predisposing factors in the western world.
Conclusion
COVID-19 has been associated with an increased mortality in doctors and health care workers. Until an effective cure/vaccine is developed, risk assessments at work, mitigating confounding factors, adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) and enhanced protection against infection are necessary to protect health care professionals on the coronavirus frontline. Otherwise this occupational risk can lead to further untimely mortality and become another unintended consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an unprecedented impact on people’s lives and the economy worldwide. Vaccines are the strongest evidence-based defense against the spread of the disease. The release of COVID-19 vaccines to the general public created policy challenges associated with how to best allocate vaccines among different sub-regions. In the United States, after vaccines became widely available for all eligible adults, policymakers faced objectives such as (i) achieving an equitable allocation to reduce populations’ travel times to get vaccinated and (ii) effectively allocating vaccine doses to minimize waste and unmet need. This problem was further exacerbated by the underlying factors of population vaccine hesitancy and sub-regions’ varying capacity levels to administer vaccines to eligible and willing populations. Although simple to implement, commonly used pro rata policies do not capture the complexities of this problem. We propose two alternatives to simple pro rata policies. The first alternative is based on a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Model that minimizes the maximum travel duration of patients and aims to achieve an equitable and effective allocation of vaccines to sub-regions while considering capacity and vaccine hesitancy. A second alternative is a heuristic approach that may be more palatable for policymakers who (i) are not familiar with mathematical modeling, (ii) are reluctant to use black-box models, and (iii) prefer algorithms that are easy to understand and implement. We demonstrate the results of our model through a case study based on real data from the state of Alabama and show that substantial improvements in travel time-based equity are achievable through capacity improvements in a small subset of counties. We perform additional computational experiments that compare the proposed methods in terms of several metrics and demonstrate the promising performance of our model and proposed heuristic. We find that while our mathematical model can achieve equitable and effective vaccine allocation, the proposed heuristic performs better if the goal is to minimize average travel duration. Finally, we explore two model extensions that aim to (i) lower vaccine hesitancy by allocating vaccines, and (ii) prioritize vaccine access for certain high-risk sub-populations.

To examine the impact of COVID-19 on clinical health outcomes and health-related social needs among Medicaid-Medicare dual-eligible beneficiaries.
Design
Scoping review.
Setting and Participants
Dual eligibles during COVID-19.
Methods
We performed a comprehensive scoping review including observational studies, clinical trials, and original empirical research studies of PubMed and CINAHL. We generated a list of terms related to programs that both serve dual eligibles and address our desired outcomes. With the assistance of a medical librarian, we identified relevant abstracts published during COVID-19 meeting our inclusion criteria. We performed full-text reviews of relevant abstracts and selected the final studies. We extracted the study population, design, and major findings, then conducted thematic analysis.
Results
1100 articles were identified, with 439 deemed relevant. On full text-review, 15 articles met inclusion criteria representing more than 86 million Medicare beneficiaries. No studies were specific only to dual eligibles. Topic areas included in this review include COVID-19 case counts (2 articles), mortality (8 articles), hospitalizations (7 articles), food insecurity (1 article), self-reported mental health (1 article), and social connectedness (2 articles). Dual eligibles had disparate COVID-19–related outcomes from Medicare-only enrollees in 12 of 15 studies. Studies show higher mortality for dual eligibles overall, but this was not true for dual eligibles in nursing homes and assisted living communities. Dual eligibles were more likely to experience food insecurity. More favorably, dual eligibles reported greater social connectedness.
Conclusions and Implications
Dual eligibles had different outcomes from Medicare-only recipients in multiple health outcomes and health-related social needs during COVID-19, but studies are limited, particularly in terms of health-related social needs. Future work focusing on outcomes only among dual-eligible beneficiaries, integrated care programs, and fiscal alignment between Medicare and Medicaid plans may help stakeholders address health needs specific to dual eligibles.

AB  - California agricultural workers are predominately Latino/a, are medically underserved, and reside in larger households, placing them at elevated COVID-19 risk at work and at home. While some research has examined COVID-19 among agricultural workers in the interior of the United States, little research exists on experiences of COVID-19 along the US-Mexico border. Grounded in resilience thinking, this study aims to understand how agricultural workers navigated their heightened risk to COVID-19 at work and at home, and made use of available resources in the context of a bi-national community. Our study utilized qualitative interviews with 12 agricultural workers to understanding the COVID-19 experiences of resident and daily migrant agricultural workers in Imperial County, California, located along the US-Mexico border. Findings suggest that agricultural workers faced significant impacts and risks at work (work stoppages, stress about bringing COVID-19 home to family) and at home (contracting COVID-19, loss of friends and family, and mental health challenges). Agricultural workers and their employers often implemented COVID-19 precautions such as social distancing measures, personal protective equipment, hand washing and hand sanitizers, and isolation. Many agricultural workers did access testing resources on either side of the US-Mexico border and worked with US-based Spanish-speaking community-based organizations to register for vaccine appointments. To better support agricultural workers and their employers in the future, we recommend the following: 1. Prioritize agricultural workplace conditions to increase agricultural worker physical and mental health, 2. Extend public health services into agricultural work sites of transit and the workplace, and 3.

AB  - Summary
Singapore developed several novel strategies to transition towards "living with COVID-19", while protecting hospital capacity. The Home Recovery Programme (HRP) was a national, centrally-administered programme that leveraged technology and telemedicine to allow low-risk individuals to safely recover at home. The HRP was subsequently expanded by partnering primary care doctors in caring for more cases in the community. A key enabler was the National Sorting Logic (NSL), a multi-step triage algorithm allowing risk-stratification of large numbers of COVID-19 patients at a national-level. At the core of the NSL was a risk assessment criterion, comprising of Comorbidities-of-concern, Age, Vaccination status, Examination/clinical findings and Symptoms (CAVES). The NSL sorted all COVID-19 cases into the various levels of care – Primary Care, HRP, COVID-19 Treatment Facility and Hospital. By adopting a national approach towards managing healthcare capacities and triaging COVID-19 patients, Singapore was able to prioritize healthcare resources for high-risk individuals and prevent hospital capacities from being overwhelmed. As part of the national response strategy to tackle COVID-19, Singapore set up and integrated key national databases to enable responsive data analysis and support evidence-based policy decisions. Using data collected between 30 August 2021 to 8 June 2022, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the outcomes and effectiveness of vaccination policies, NSL and home-based recovery. A total of 1,240,183 COVID-19 cases were diagnosed during this period, spanning both Delta and Omicron waves, Overall, Singapore experienced very low severity (0.51%) and mortality (0.11%) rates. Vaccinations significantly lowered severity and mortality risks across all age groups. The NSL was effective in predicting risk of severe outcomes and was able to right-site >93% of cases into home-based recovery. By leveraging high vaccination rates, technology and telemedicine, Singapore was able to safely navigate through two COVID-19 waves without impacting severity/mortality rates nor overwhelming hospital capacities.

AB  - Summary
Although the development and clinical application of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated unprecedented vaccine success in a short time frame, it also revealed a limitation of current vaccines in their inability to provide broad-spectrum or universal protection against emerging variants. Broad-spectrum vaccines, therefore, remain a dream and challenge for vaccinology. This review will focus on current and future efforts in developing universal vaccines targeting different viruses at the genus and/or family levels, with a special focus on henipaviruses, influenza viruses, and coronaviruses. It is evident that strategies for developing broad-spectrum vaccines will be virus-genus or family specific, and it is almost impossible to adopt a universal approach for different viruses. On the other hand, efforts in developing broad-spectrum neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been more successful and it is worth considering broad-spectrum antibody-mediated immunization, or “universal antibody vaccine,” as an alternative approach for early intervention for future disease X outbreaks.

We investigated whether COVID-19 vaccination had an impact on diabetes risk.
Methods
We used data of 6,198 patients (mean age 64.3 years) from the nationwide Disease Analyzer database, a representative panel of physicians’ practices in Germany. Patients received their first COVID-19 vaccination between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022, and all were newly diagnosed with diabetes within 183 days before or after this vaccination. Incident rates of diabetes after vaccination were compared to incident rates before vaccination.
Results
The incidence rate of diabetes was lower after vaccination than before vaccination (incidence rate ratio = 0.79, 95% confidence interval: 0.75–0.83). The number of incident cases of diabetes was not greater in 2021 than in 2019.
Conclusion
Our study did not confirm an increased risk of diabetes after COVID-19 vaccination. Further studies are needed to show whether the vaccination may be associated with a reduced diabetes risk.

AB  - Summary
Background
Previous comparative analyses of people admitted to hospital for COVID-19 versus influenza evaluated the risk of death, hospital readmission, and a narrow set of health outcomes up to 6 months following infection. We aimed to do a comparative evaluation of both acute and long-term risks and burdens of a comprehensive set of health outcomes following hospital admission for COVID-19 or seasonal influenza.
Methods
For this cohort study we used the health-care databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to analyse data from 81 280 participants admitted to hospital for COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2022, and 10 985 participants admitted to hospital for seasonal influenza between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 28, 2019. Participants were followed up for up to 18 months to comparatively evaluate risks and burdens of death, a prespecified set of 94 individual health outcomes, ten organ systems, overall burden across all organ systems, readmission, and admission to intensive care. Inverse probability weighting was used to balance the baseline characteristics. Cox and Poisson models were used to generate estimates of risk on both the relative scale and absolute scale as the event rate and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per 100 persons.
Findings
Over 18 months of follow-up, compared to seasonal influenza, the COVID-19 group had an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 1·51 [95% CI 1·45–1·58]), corresponding to an excess death rate of 8·62 (95% CI 7·55–9·44) per 100 persons in the COVID-19 group versus the influenza group. Comparative analyses of 94 prespecified health outcomes showed that COVID-19 had an increased risk of 68·1% (64 of 94) pre-specified health outcomes; seasonal influenza was associated with an increased risk of 6·4% (six of 94) pre-specified health outcomes, including three out of four pre-specified pulmonary outcomes. Analyses of organ systems showed that COVID-19 had a higher risk across all organ systems except for the pulmonary system, the risk of which was higher in seasonal influenza. The cumulative rates of adverse health outcomes across all organ systems were 615·18 (95% CI 605·17–624·88) per 100 persons in COVID-19 and 536·90 (527·38–544·90) per 100 persons in seasonal influenza, corresponding to an excess rate of 78·72 (95% CI 66·15–91·24) per 100 persons in COVID-19. The total number of DALYs across all organ systems were 287·43 (95% CI 281·10–293·59) per 100 persons in the COVID-19 group and 242·66 (236·75, 247·67) per 100 persons in the seasonal influenza group, corresponding to 45·03 (95% CI 37·15–52·90) higher DALYs per 100 persons in COVID-19. Decomposition analyses showed that in both COVID-19 and seasonal influenza, there was a higher burden of health loss in the post-acute than the acute phase; and comparatively, except for the pulmonary system, COVID-19 had a higher burden of health loss across all other organ systems than seasonal influenza in both the acute and post-acute phase. Compared to seasonal influenza, COVID-19 also had an increased risk of hospital readmission (excess rate 20·50 [95% CI 16·10–24·86] per 100 persons) and admission to intensive care (excess rate 9·23 [6·68–11·82] per 100 persons). The findings were consistent in analyses comparatively evaluating risks in seasonal influenza versus COVID-19 by individuals' respective vaccination status and in those admitted to hospital during the pre-delta, delta, and omicron eras.
Interpretation
Although rates of death and adverse health outcomes following hospital admission for either seasonal influenza or COVID-19 are high, this comparative analysis shows that hospital admission for COVID-19 was associated with higher long-term risks of death and adverse health outcomes in nearly every organ system (except for the pulmonary system) and significant cumulative excess DALYs than hospital admission for seasonal influenza. The substantial cumulative burden of health loss in both groups calls for greater prevention of hospital admission for these two viruses and for greater attention to the care needs of people with long-term health effects due to either seasonal influenza or SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Summary
Background
COVID-19 pandemic research efforts have focused on disease phenotypes in adults. A distinct spectrum of illness has been documented in paediatric populations. We aimed to review paediatric intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in Australia, across differing variant predominant phases of the pandemic.
Methods
Data reported to the Short PeRiod IncideNce sTudy of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SPRINT-SARI) Australia, across 49 ICUs from February 2020 to June 2022 were extracted. We defined ‘child’ as patients aged <12 years, ‘adolescent’ as patients aged 12–17 years, and ‘young adult’ as patients aged 18–25 years.
Findings
We identified 226 paediatric ICU admissions with COVID-19, representing 3.9% of ICU admissions across the study period. Comorbidity was present in 34.6% of children, 51.4% of adolescents, and 48.7% of young adults. The need for respiratory support was highest in young adults. While 28.3% of patients <18 years required invasive ventilation, in-hospital mortality in paediatric patients was 3.6%. During the Omicron period, there was an increase in the annualised incidence of age-specific COVID-19 ICU admissions per 100,000 population, albeit a decrease in the incidence per 1000 SARS-CoV-2 notifications.
Interpretation
This study demonstrated an appreciable burden of COVID-19 in paediatric patients. Adolescent patients presented phenotypically similar to young adults, however, illness severity was lower in younger cohorts. The Omicron phase of the pandemic demonstrated an increased age-specific population incidence of COVID-19 ICU admissions, albeit a reduced incidence when based on SARS-CoV-2 notifications.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Importance
On an ecological scale, the lag time between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and related fatality has varied between epidemic waves and prefectures in Japan. The variability in lag time across areas of Japan during the seven distinct waves can help derive a more appropriate estimation of the weekly confirmed case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19.
Objective
To estimate the 7-day moving average CFR across area block levels in Japan from February 2020 to July 2022 using the lag time between COVID-19 infection and related fatality.
Main outcomes and measures
The 7-day moving average CFR of COVID-19 for area blocks in Japan considering the lag time between infection and death (total and subgroup analysis of elderly).
Results
Lag time was found to vary substantially among prefectures in Japan from the first wave to the seventh wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. The estimated 7-day moving average CFR based on the lag time reflects the Japanese COVID-19 pandemic and related policy interventions (e.g. vaccination of elderly people) rather than other standard CFR estimations.
Conclusions and relevance
The variation in estimated lag time across prefectures in Japan for different epidemic waves indicates that it is inadequate to use the clinical results of the period from the start of infection to death for evaluation of the ecological scale of the CFR. Moreover, the lag time between infection and related fatality was found to be either shorter or longer than the clinically reported period. This revealed that preliminary reports of CFR may be overestimated or underestimated, even if they consider the lag based on clinical reports.

AB  - Background
Russia has been portrayed in media as having one of the highest death tolls due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the world. However, the precise scale of excess mortality is still unclear. We provide the first estimates of excess mortality in Russia as a whole and its regions in 2020, placing this in an international context.
Methods
We used monthly death rates for Russia and 83 regions plus the equivalent for 36 comparator countries. Expected mortality was derived in two ways using averages in the same months in preceding years and the same averages adjusted for secular trends. Excess death rates were estimated for the whole year and the last 3 quarters. We also estimated the relationships between excess mortality and reported COVID-19 cases and deaths across countries and Russian regions.
Results
Estimating excess deaths rates based on the trend-adjusted average, Russia had the highest excess mortality of any of the 37 countries considered. Using the simple average, Russia had the third highest. Most of the excess deaths were recorded in the 4th quarter of 2020 and the level and trajectory of excess mortality in Russia and most of Eastern European countries differed from that in Western countries. While both the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and deaths showed positive correlations with excess mortality across countries (r=0.65 and r=0.75, p<0.001), the association across the Russian regions was, surprisingly, negative for cases (r=-0.34, p<0.01) and deaths (r=-0.09, p=0.42). When we replaced reported deaths with final data from death certificates the correlation was positive (r=0.38, p<0.001).
Conclusion
Russia has one of the largest absolute burden of excess mortality in 2020 but there is a counter-intuitive negative association between excess mortality and cumulative incidence at the regional level. Under-recording of COVID-19 cases seems to be a problem in some regions.

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of social learning on the transmission of Covid-19 in a network model. We calibrate our model to detailed data for Cape Town, South Africa and show that the inclusion of social learning improves the prediction of excess fatalities, reducing the best-fit squared difference from 19.34 to 11.40. The inclusion of social learning both flattens and shortens the curves for infections, hospitalizations, and excess fatalities, which is qualitatively different from flattening the curve by reducing the contact rate or transmission probability through non-pharmaceutical interventions. While social learning reduces infections, this alone is not sufficient to curb the spread of the virus because learning is slower than the rate at which the disease spreads. We use our model to study the efficacy of different vaccination strategies and find that vaccinating vulnerable groups first leads to a 72% reduction in fatalities and a 5% increase in total infections compared to a random-order benchmark. By contrast, using a contact-based vaccination strategy reduces infections by only 0.9% but results in 42% more fatalities than the benchmark.

AB  - Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has helped to clarify the fair and equitable allocation of scarce medical resources, both within and among countries. The ethical allocation of such resources entails a three-step process: (1) elucidating the fundamental ethical values for allocation, (2) using these values to delineate priority tiers for scarce resources, and (3) implementing the prioritisation to faithfully realise the fundamental values. Myriad reports and assessments have elucidated five core substantive values for ethical allocation: maximising benefits and minimising harms, mitigating unfair disadvantage, equal moral concern, reciprocity, and instrumental value. These values are universal. None of the values are sufficient alone, and their relative weight and application will vary by context. In addition, there are procedural principles such as transparency, engagement, and evidence-responsiveness. Prioritising instrumental value and minimising harms during the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread agreement on priority tiers to include health-care workers, first responders, people living in congregate housing, and people with an increased risk of death, such as older adults and individuals with medical conditions. However, the pandemic also revealed problems with the implementation of these values and priority tiers, such as allocation on the basis of population rather than COVID-19 burden, and passive allocation that exacerbated disparities by requiring recipients to spend time booking and travelling to appointments. This ethical framework should be the starting point for the allocation of scarce medical resources in future pandemics and other public health conditions. For instance, allocation of the new malaria vaccine among sub-Saharan African countries should be based not on reciprocity to countries that participated in research, but on maximally reducing serious illness and deaths, especially among infants and children.

AB  - Covid-19 endangers lives, has disrupted normal life, changed the way medicine is practised and is likely to alter our world for the foreseeable future. Almost two years on since the presumptive first diagnosis of COVID-19 in China, more than two hundred and fifty million cases have been confirmed and more than five million people have died globally, with the figures rising daily. One of the most striking aspects of COVID-19 illness is the marked difference in individuals’ experiences of the disease. Some, most often younger groups, are asymptomatic, whereas others become severely ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia or proceed to fatal organ disease. The highest death rates are in the older and oldest age groups and in people with co-morbidities such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. Three major questions seem important to consider. What do we understand about changes in the immune system that might contribute to the older person’s risk of developing severe COVID-19? What factors contribute to the higher morbidity and mortality in older people with COVID-19? How could immunocompetence in the older and the frailest individuals and populations be supported and enhanced to give protection from serious COVID-19 illness?

AB  - Summary
A growing body of evidence indicates that obesity is strongly and independently associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19, including death. By combining emerging knowledge of the pathological processes involved in COVID-19 with insights into the mechanisms underlying the adverse health consequences of obesity, we present some hypotheses regarding the deleterious impact of obesity on the course of COVID-19. These hypotheses are testable and could guide therapeutic and preventive interventions. As obesity is now almost ubiquitous and no vaccine for COVID-19 is currently available, even a modest reduction in the impact of obesity on mortality and morbidity from this viral infection could have profound consequences for public health.

AB  - Aims
COVID-19 had a devastating impact on patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Like many cardiac procedures, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) services were suspended during the first wave of COVID-19. We took the opportunity to evaluate the clinical outcomes and identify any delays at different stages of the TAVR pathway during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
Prospectively collected data on 210 consecutive TAVR patients between March 2019 and March 2021 were analysed. We compared the clinical outcomes and 30-day mortality rates of TAVR cases pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. We also looked to identify any time lags from the initial referral to respective stages of the TAVR workup.
Results
A total of 134 patients underwent TAVR prior to the national lockdown (March 2019-March 2020), compared to 76 patients during COVID-19 (April 2020–April 2021). Success rates of TAVR were similar (99% prior to the pandemic and 97.4% during COVID-19). The 30-day survival rates were 98.6% and 94.7%, respectively. Median length of stay post TAVR was 2 days during COVID-19 and 2.5 days prior to the pandemic (p = 0.064). Patients were seen quicker in clinic (median of 33 days) during COVID-19, compared to 51 days before COVID-19 (p = 0.044). No significant difference in times from referral to discussion at TAVR multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings, CT Aortogram and TAVR implantation, in both groups.
Conclusions
Reconfiguring the patient pathway during COVID-19 allowed TAVR to be performed safely, with a similar success rate and no excess complications or increased 30-day mortality. There proved to be no delay in the respective stages of patient TAVR workup, during the pandemic.

AB  - Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a serious challenge to the hepatology community, particularly healthcare professionals and patients. While the rapid development of safe and effective vaccines and treatments has improved the clinical landscape, the emergence of the omicron variant has presented new challenges. Thus, it is timely that the European Association for the Study of the Liver provides a summary of the latest data on the impact of COVID-19 on the liver and issues guidance on the care of patients with chronic liver disease, hepatobiliary cancer, and previous liver transplantation, as the world continues to deal with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Summary
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic generated high workloads given the high volume of seriously ill patients; conditions that could increase the risk of adverse events (AE). This study analyzed the frequency of AE in patients with COVID-19 and their effect on mortality, hospital stay and costs.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study included in-patients with COVID-19 at a single hospital between March 2020–June 2021. Exposure was the occurrence of at least one AE. Hospital stay, costs and death were considered outcomes. Clinical information and direct costs were obtained from medical and billing records. Generalized linear models were used to estimate the association measures.
Results
405 patients were included, 55.8% (n=226) men, median age 56 years (IQR: 41.0–70.0) and with a history of hypertension (26.2%; n=106), diabetes mellitus (13.8%; n=56) and obesity (13.8%; n=56). The incidence of AE was 13.3% (n=54), 29 patients presented more than one AE, for a total of 70 events. Most events (74.3%; n=52) were preventable and the most frequent were healthcare-associated infections (50%; n=35), phlebitis (14.3%; n=10) and pressure ulcers (12.9%; n=9). AE prolonged hospital stay (change rate: 1.57; 95%CI: 1.26–1.95; P=0.001) and increased direct healthcare costs (change rate: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.03–1.39, P=0.019). Likewise, the risk of death was 56% higher in patients with AE.
Conclusion
Pandemics are unexpected events that present challenges to safe healthcare. Improving quality policies, monitoring compliance with protocols and providing ongoing education are strategies to prevent AE such as healthcare-associated infections, which increase hospital costs and stay.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 may negatively impact the prognosis of patients with chronic HFrEF and vice versa.
Methods
This study included 2 parallel analyses of patients in the United States who were in the TriNetX health database and who underwent polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2 as an inpatient or outpatient between January and September of 2020. Analysis A included patients with positive tests for COVID-19 and compared patients with histories of worsening heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (hospitalization due to heart failure (HF) or IV diuretic use during the prior 12 months), HFrEF without worsening, and no prior HF. Analysis B included patients with histories of HFrEF and compared patients with positive vs negative COVID-19 tests. Outcomes included mortality and worsening HF. In both analyses, prespecified subgroup analyses were stratified by inpatient vs outpatient settings of the COVID-19 tests.
Results
In Analysis A, of 99,052 patients with positive COVID-19 tests, 514 (0.5%) and 524 (0.5%) patients had histories of worsening HFrEF and HFrEF without worsening, respectively. After adjustment, compared to patients without HF, worsening HFrEF (risk ratio [RR] 1.42, 95% CI 1.10–1.83; P< 0.001) and HFrEF without worsening (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.96–1.84; P= 0.06) were associated with higher 30-day mortality rates. Excess risk of mortality tended to be pronounced in patients initially diagnosed with COVID-19 as outpatients (P for interaction, 0.12 and 0.006, respectively). In Analysis B, of 14,838 patients with HFrEF tested for COVID-19, 1038 (7.0%) had positive tests. After adjustment, testing positive was associated with excess 30-day mortality risk (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.38–2.02; P< 0.001) and worsening HF (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.17–1.51; P< 0.001). Mortality risk was nominally more pronounced among patients presenting as outpatients (P for interaction 0.07).
Conclusion
In this large cohort of patients tested for COVID-19, among patients testing positive, a history of HFrEF with or without worsening was associated with excess mortality rates, particularly among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 as outpatients. Among patients with established HFrEF, compared with testing negative, testing positive for COVID-19 was independently associated with higher risk of death and worsening HF.

AB  - Objective
Our aim in this study was to determine the reasons for hospitalization in Australian people with diabetes who contract COVID-19.
Methods
All COVID-19 cases reported to the Victorian Department of Health and linked hospitalization data were assessed. We determined reasons for acute (0 to 30 days) and postacute (31 to 365 days) hospitalization among those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and COVID-19, compared to those with COVID-19 and no diabetes, and to admissions before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Results
Australians (N=13,302) with type 1 or type 2 diabetes were hospitalized in the state of Victoria in the 12 months after COVID-19 diagnosis. Respiratory diseases accounted for 40% of acute admissions among those with diabetes. Viral pneumonia was the leading cause of acute hospitalization among those with diabetes and constituted a larger proportion of admissions in those with compared to those without diabetes (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.87, 95% confidence interval 1.76 to 1.99). The distribution of postacute hospitalizations among those with diabetes aligned with that of people with diabetes before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conclusions
Respiratory diseases are the leading cause of acute hospitalization in those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and COVID-19. The reasons for postacute hospitalization resemble those in people with diabetes and no COVID-19. We reinforce the importance of community management of people with diabetes in the ongoing pandemic.
Résumé
Objectif
Déterminer les causes d'hospitalisation chez les personnes atteintes de diabète qui contractent la COVID-19.
Méthodes
Nous avons analysé tous les cas de COVID-19 signalés au Département de la Santé de l'État de Victoria et les avons associés aux données d'hospitalisation. Nous avons déterminé les causes d’hospitalisations aiguës (0-30 jours) et post-aiguës (31-365 jours) chez les personnes atteintes de diabète de type 1 ou de type 2 et de COVID-19, en les comparant à celles des personnes atteintes de COVID-19 sans diabète, ainsi qu'aux admissions antérieures à la pandémie de COVID-19.
Résultats
13,302 Australiens atteints de diabète de type 1 ou de type 2 ont été hospitalisés dans l'État de Victoria au cours des 12 mois suivant le diagnostic de COVID-19. Les maladies respiratoires représentaient 40% des admissions aiguës chez les personnes atteintes de diabète. La pneumonie virale était la raison première d'une hospitalisation aiguë chez les personnes atteintes de diabète et représentait une plus grande proportion des admissions chez les personnes atteintes de diabète par rapport à celles sans diabète (RP ajusté 1.87, IC à 95 % 1.76 – 1.99). La répartition des hospitalisations en phase post-aiguës chez les personnes atteintes de diabète correspondait à celle des personnes atteintes de diabète avant la pandémie de COVID-19.
Conclusion
Les maladies respiratoires représentent la principale raison d'une hospitalisation aiguë chez les personnes atteintes de diabète de type 1 ou de type 2 et de COVID-19. Les raisons associées à une hospitalisation en phase post-aiguë sont semblables à celles des personnes atteintes de diabète en absence de COVID-19. Nous soulignons l'importance de la prise en charge communautaire des personnes atteintes de diabète dans le contexte de la pandémie actuelle.

AB  - Objective
This study aims to examine the interplay between high policy stringency, vaccination rates and epidemiological outcomes to develop insights on COVID-19 policy transition in Singapore
Methods
The CPTI (Categorising Policy & Technology Interventions) framework was used to classify reported interventions from January 2021 to October 2022. To analyse the impact of vaccine measures, an additional category was created. The highest monthly proportion of de-escalated measures was used as a basis to define the periods that mark the policy transition in Singapore i.e. Phase 2 and 3. Proportions of significantly escalated measures were calculated and analysed against full and booster vaccination rates, alongside epidemiological indicators – monthly total number of infections and deaths, and monthly average active hospitalisation and ICU cases.
Results
Implementation of highly stringent policies were observed to have reduced in intensity as vaccination rates picked up from Phase 2 to 3. Containment measures were the most frequently and consistently adopted beside vaccine policies. Epidemiological indicators appeared to be generally lower in Phase 3 than Phase 2. Specifically, despite reduced intensity of stringent polices, hospitalisation and ICU cases were observed to remain relatively low when vaccination rates were correspondingly higher in Phase 3 compared to Phase 2.
Conclusion
The descriptive analysis of COVID-19 policy shift in Singapore based on selected indicators preliminarily suggested its successful transition from the pandemic to endemic phase in its response strategies. A policy transition plan should consider the significance of vaccination rates in an exit strategy that protects the population against worse health outcomes.

KW  - COVID-19
KW  - Vaccination paths
AB  - In this paper we ask how to best allocate a given time-varying supply of vaccines during the second phase of the Covid-19 pandemic across individuals of different ages. Building on our previous heterogeneous household model of optimal economic mitigation and redistribution (Glover et al., 2021) we contrast the actual vaccine deployment path that prioritized older, retired individuals with one that first vaccinates younger workers. Vaccinating the old first saves more lives but slows the economic recovery, relative to inoculating the young first. Vaccines deliver large welfare benefits in both scenarios (relative to a world without vaccines), but the old-first policy is optimal under a utilitarian social welfare function. The welfare gains from having vaccinated the old first are especially significant once the economy is hit by a more infectious Delta variant in the summer of 2021.

AB  - In this study, we investigate whether COVID-19 deaths that occurred before vaccination rollouts impact subsequent vaccination take-up. We use data on local vaccination rates and COVID-19-related deaths from England measured at high geographic granularity. We find that vaccination take-up as of November 2021 is positively associated with pre-vaccine COVID-19-related deaths, controlling for demographic, economic, and health-related characteristics of the localities, while including geographic fixed effects. In addition, the share of ethnic minorities in a locality is negatively associated with vaccination rates, and localities with a larger share of ethnic minorities increase their vaccination rates if they are exposed to more COVID-related-deaths. Further evidence on vaccination intention at the individual level from a representative sample corroborates these patterns. Overall, our evidence suggests that social proximity to victims of the disease triggers a desire to take protective measures against it.

AB  - Objectives
The Hungarian vaccination campaign was conducted with five different vaccines during the third wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2021. This observational study (HUN-VE: Hungarian Vaccine Effectiveness) estimated vaccine effectiveness against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19-related mortality in 3.7 million vaccinated individuals.
Methods
Incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related mortality were calculated using data from the National Public Health Centre surveillance database. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was calculated as 1 – incidence rate ratio ≥7 days after the second dose for each available vaccine versus an unvaccinated control group using mixed-effect negative binomial regression controlling for age, sex and calendar day.
Results
Between 22 January 2021 and 10 June 2021, 3 740 066 Hungarian individuals received two doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), HB02 (Sinopharm), Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik-V), AZD1222 (AstraZeneca), or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines. Incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related death were 1.73–9.3/100 000 person-days and 0.04–0.65/100 000 person-days in the fully vaccinated population, respectively. Estimated adjusted effectiveness varied between 68.7% (95% CI 67.2%–70.1%) and 88.7% (95% CI 86.6%–90.4%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and between 87.8% (95% CI 86.1%–89.4%) and 97.5% (95% CI 95.6%–98.6%) against COVID-19-related death, with 100% effectiveness in individuals aged 16–44 years for all vaccines.
Conclusions
Our observational study demonstrated the high or very high effectiveness of five different vaccines in the prevention SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related death.

AB  - Objective
To describe adverse events following COVID‐19 immunisation (AEFI) and participation in AusVaxSafety surveillance in a Queensland regional community.
Methods
Participants presenting for second dose COVID‐19 vaccine at the Hervey Bay Wide Bay Hospital and Health Service (WBHHS) vaccine clinic in July 2021 completed a survey pertaining to their first COVID‐19 vaccine. Data collected included participation in AusVaxSafety surveillance, vaccine type (BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) or ChAdOx1‐S(Oxford/AstraZeneca), AEFI experienced and impact on work/routine activities. Multivariable logistic regression related demographic factors to odds of surveillance participation and AEFI occurrence.
Results
Of 1,148 participants, 37.6% participated in AusVaxSafety surveillance and 44.8% reported an AEFI. Participation in surveillance was higher in older (≥50 vs <50 years: OR 1.36, 95%CI:1.04–1.78) and less‐educated participants (university vs. high school/below: OR 0.68, 95%CI:0.48–0.95). Reporting an AEFI was higher in younger (≥50 years vs. <50 years: BNT162b2: OR 0.69, 95%CI:0.51–0.93; ChAdOx1‐S: OR 0.42, 95%CI:0.10–1.89), female (female vs. male: BNT162b2: OR 2.28, 95%CI:1.67–3.12; ChAdOx1‐S: OR 1.85, 95%CI:1.17–2.94) and more educated participants (university vs. high school/below: BNT162b2:OR 1.63, 95%CI: 1.08–2.45; ChAdOx1‐S: OR 3.98, 95%CI:2.03–7.79). Of participants with an AEFI, 15% reported missing work/routine activities.
Conclusions
Participation in surveillance was modest in this regional population, despite AEFI being frequent, and impacts of absenteeism in this setting warrants further research.
Implications for public health
The findings can inform strategies to improve surveillance participation and inform workforce planning in regional areas.

AB  - Objective
COVID-19 is associated with an elevated risk of thromboembolism and excess mortality. Difficulties with best anticoagulation practices and their implementation motivated the current analysis of COVID-19 patients who developed Venous Thromboembolism (VTE).
Method
This is a post-hoc analysis of a COVID-19 cohort, described in an economic study already published. The authors analyzed a subset of patients with confirmed VTE. We described the characteristics of the cohort, such as demographics, clinical status, and laboratory results. We tested differences amid two subgroups of patients, those with VTE or not, with the competitive risk Fine and Gray model.
Results
Out of 3186 adult patients with COVID-19, 245 (7.7%) were diagnosed with VTE, 174 (5.4%) of them during admission to the hospital. Four (2.3% of these 174) did not receive prophylactic anticoagulation and 19 (11%) discontinued anticoagulation for at least 3 days, resulting in 170 analyzed. During the first week of hospitalization, the laboratory most altered results were C-reactive protein and D-dimer. Patients with VTE were more critical, had a higher mortality rate, worse SOFA score, and, on average, 50% longer hospital stay.
Conclusion
Proven VTE incidence in this severe COVID-19 cohort was 7.7%, despite 87% of them complying completely with VTE prophylaxis. The clinician must be aware of the diagnosis of VTE in COVID-19, even in patients receiving proper prophylaxis.

Background
Prior to the availability of vaccines, the risk factors for developing severe forms of COVID-19 were mostly older age and various comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, mental disorders, transplantations, and kidney disease. Although vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing severe forms of COVID-19, a residual risk may persist, despite vaccination, for certain population groups.
Methods
The study was based on data from the national COVID-19 vaccination database (VAC-SI) coupled with the National Health Data System (SNDS), which contains comprehensive reimbursement and hospitalisation data for all of France. All people fully vaccinated by July 31, 2021, with a double-injection vaccine, i.e., the mRNA BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines, or a single dose for people with a previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included and followed until August 31, 2021. Cox proportional hazard models were performed to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for COVID-19-related hospitalisation or in-hospital death associated with age, gender, deprivation index, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive or oral corticosteroid therapy from day 14 after full-vaccination.
Findings
In a population of 28,031,641 fully vaccinated individuals with an average follow-up of 80 days, 5,345 (87 hospitalisations per 100,000 person-years) were hospitalised for COVID-19 and 996 (16 in-hospital death per 100,000 person-years) died in hospital. In multivariable analysis, a higher risk was observed with increasing age, male gender, and social deprivation. Most of the 47 chronic conditions considered were positively associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation and a slight excess risk of death. The risk of hospitalisation and in-hospital death for COVID-19 also increased with the use of immunosuppressants (aHR 3.3 [2.8-3.8] and 2.4 [1.7-3.5], respectively) and oral corticosteroids (aHR 2.8 [2.5-3.1] and 4.1 [3.3-5.1]). Less than 10% (519/5,345) of hospitalised cases and 2% (24/996) of those who died in hospital had no identified comorbidities. There was a strong association between an increasing number of comorbidities and the risk of hospitalisation and in-hospital death (e.g., 5+ versus none, aHR 10.1 95%CI 9.0-11.5 and 17.8 95%CI 11.5-27.4, respectively).
Interpretation
Although vaccination has dramatically reduced the occurrence of severe forms of COVID-19, a residual risk remains for the elderly, immunocompromised, and polypathological populations and warrants complementary preventive measures.

AB  - We derive the optimal funding mechanism to incentivize development and production of vaccines against diseases with epidemic potential. In the model, suppliers’ costs are private information and investments are noncontractible, precluding cost-reimbursement contracts, requiring fixed-price contracts conditioned on delivery of a successful product. The high failure risk for individual vaccines calls for incentivizing multiple entrants, accomplished by the optimal mechanism, a (w+1)-price reverse Vickrey auction with reserve, where w is the number of selected entrants. Our analysis determines the optimal number of entrants and required funding level. Based on a distribution of supplier costs estimated from survey data, we simulate the optimal mechanism’s performance in scenarios ranging from a small outbreak, causing harm in the millions of dollars, to the Covid-19 pandemic, causing harm in the trillions. We assess which mechanism features contribute most to its optimality.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019, China and later it was found that the causative microorganism is severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). As on 3rd June 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has affected 171049741 people worldwide with 3549710 deaths. Nanomedicine such as nanoparticles, liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, virus-like nanoparticles offer tremendous hopes to treat viral infections including COVID-19. Most importantly target specific ligands can be attached on the surface of them and this makes them more target specific and the loaded drug can be delivered to cellular and molecular level. These properties of nanomedicines can be utilized to deliver drugs or vaccines to treat viral diseases including SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review discusses about SARS-CoV-2 and the potential application of nanomedicines for delivering biological macromolecules like vaccines and drugs for treating COVID-19.

AB  - This paper introduces new methods to study the changing dynamics of COVID-19 cases and deaths among the 50 worst-affected countries throughout 2020. First, we analyse the trajectories and turning points of rolling mortality rates to understand at which times the disease was most lethal. We demonstrate five characteristic classes of mortality rate trajectories and determine structural similarity in mortality trends over time. Next, we introduce a class of virulence matrices to study the evolution of COVID-19 cases and deaths on a global scale. Finally, we introduce three-way inconsistency analysis to determine anomalous countries with respect to three attributes: countries’ COVID-19 cases, deaths and human development indices. We demonstrate the most anomalous countries across these three measures are Pakistan, the United States and the United Arab Emirates.

AB  - With the emergence of COVID-19 vaccines, individuals with comorbidities and immunosuppression require particular attention and should be prioritized for vaccination. However, the majority of vaccine clinical trials excluded people with comorbidities, resulting in a lack of data regarding vaccine efficacy in this demographic. Along with more inclusivity in clinical trials, reaching a definitive conclusion regarding vaccine efficacy in these patients is also crucial. In our review, we highlight the BNT162b2 vaccine safety and efficacy based on the limited number of clinical trials which included this demographic. We also provide vaccine considerations for individuals with cancer, autoimmune diseases, HIV, obesity, diabetes, organ transplant recipients and those undergoing maintenance haemodialysis to help them govern their decision regarding vaccine administration. In conclusion, further studies are required to alleviate any insecurities in patients with comorbidities regarding vaccination and it is recommended that patients are monitored post-vaccination to make sure sufficient immunity is achieved.

AB  - Introduction
The immunogenicity and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination varied by demographic, including solid organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy.
Aim
This purpose of this study is to assess seropositivity and seroconversion in solid-organ transplant recipients before and after third-dose COVID-19 vaccination.
Methods
This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis performed using PRISMA guidelines. To analyze clinical and cohort studies reporting immunologic response and seroconversion third-dose vaccination, a systematic search was performed using electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Directory of Open Access Journal (DOAJ), and Clinicaltrials.gov).
Result
There were 18 full-text papers that could be analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. After the third vaccination, the pooled rate seropositivity was 67.00% (95% CI 59.511; 74.047, I2 = 93.82%), and the pooled rate seroconversion was 52.51% (95% CI 44.03; 60.91, I2 = 92.15%). The pooled rate of seroconversion after the mRNA-based booster was 52.380% (95% CI 40.988; 63.649, I2 = 94.35%), and after the viral-vector-based booster was 42.478% (95% CI 35.222; 49.900, I2 = 0.00%).
Conclusion
Based on the analysis of immunologic responses and seroconversion findings, the third-dose vaccination of solid organ transplant recipients is an effective method in establishing better immunity against COVID-19.

AB  - Among the majority of research on individual factors leading to coronavirus mortality, age has been identified as a dominant factor. Health and other individual factors including gender, comorbidity, ethnicity and obesity have also been identified by other studies. In contrast, we examine the role of economic structural factors on COVID-19 mortality rates. Particularly, focusing on a densely populated region of France, we document evidence that higher economic “precariousness indicators” such as unemployment and poverty rates, lack of formal education and housing are important factors in determining COVID-19 mortality rates. Our study will help inform policy makers regarding the role of economic factors in managing pandemics.

AB  - Developing messaging to encourage minorities to adhere to health recommendations has been a complex task for governments worldwide during the COVID-19 crisis. Here, we propose and tests a new typology of messages among minorities that can be used to mobilize compliance and engagement. This typology comprises three messaging treatments emphasizing personal, ingroup, and intergroup benefits. We examine, via an experimental field study, whether there is a difference in the effect of these messages on two policy outcomes, social distancing and vaccine hesitancy, among the Arab minority living in Israel. The findings suggest that social messages, i.e., ingroup and intergroup messages, positively affect social distancing, while self-messaging harms social distancing compliance. Regarding vaccine intake, within the social messages tested, intergroup-focused messages were more effective than ingroup-focused messages for vaccination intentions only among citizens with low trust in the government. We discuss the findings in detail and propose new avenues in theory and practice to foster health policy compliance among minorities.

AB  - Background
COVID‐19 vaccination has been associated with increased venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk. However, it is unknown whether genetic predisposition to VTE is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis following vaccination.
Methods
Using data from the UK Biobank, which contains in‐depth genotyping and linked vaccination and health outcomes information, we generated a polygenic risk score (PRS) using 299 genetic variants. We prospectively assessed associations between PRS and incident VTE immediately after first‐ and the second‐dose vaccination and among historical unvaccinated cohorts during the pre‐ and early pandemic. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) for PRS‐VTE associations using Cox models.
Results
Of 359 310 individuals receiving one dose of a COVID‐19 vaccine, 160 327 (44.6%) were males, and the mean age at the vaccination date was 69.05 (standard deviation [SD] 8.04) years. After 28‐ and 90‐days’ follow‐up, 88 and 299 individuals developed VTE, respectively, equivalent to an incidence rate of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70–1.08) and 0.92 (0.82–1.04) per 100 000 person‐days. The PRS was significantly associated with a higher risk of VTE (HR per 1 SD increase in PRS, 1.41 (1.15–1.73) in 28 days and 1.36 (1.22–1.52) in 90 days). Similar associations were found in the historical unvaccinated cohorts.
Conclusions
The strength of genetic susceptibility with post‐COVID‐19‐vaccination VTE is similar to that seen in historical data. Additionally, the observed PRS‐VTE associations were equivalent for adenovirus‐ and mRNA‐based vaccines. These findings suggest that, at the population level, the VTE that occurred after the COVID‐19 vaccination has a similar genetic etiology to the conventional VTE.

AB  - To contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries around the globe have adopted social distancing measures. Yet, establishing the causal effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is difficult because they do not occur arbitrarily. We exploit a quasi-random source of variation for identification purposes –namely, regional differences in the placement on the pandemic curve following an unexpected and nationwide lockdown. Our results reveal that regions where the outbreak had just started when the lockdown was implemented had 1.62 fewer daily deaths per 100,000 inhabitants when compared to regions for which the lockdown arrived 10+ days after the pandemic’s outbreak. As a result, a total of 4,642 total deaths (232 deaths/daily) could have been avoided by the end of our period of study –a figure representing 23% of registered deaths in Spain at the time. We rule out differential pre−COVID mortality trends and self-distancing behaviors across the compared regions prior to the swift lockdown, which was also uniformly observed nationwide. In addition, we provide supporting evidence for contagion deceleration as the main mechanism behind the effectiveness of the early adoption of NPIs in lowering the death rate, rather than an increased healthcare capacity.

AB  - People are more likely to interact with other people of their ethnicity—a phenomenon known as ethnic homophily. In the United States, people of color are known to hold proportionately more high-contact jobs and are thus more at risk of virus infection. At the same time, these ethnic groups are on average younger than the rest of the population. This gives rise to interesting disease dynamics and non-trivial trade-offs that should be taken into consideration when developing prioritization strategies for future mass vaccine roll-outs. Here, we study the spread of COVID-19 through the US population, stratified by age, ethnicity, and occupation, using a detailed, previously-developed compartmental disease model. Based on historic data from the US mass COVID-19 vaccine roll-out that began in December 2020, we show, (i) how ethnic homophily affects the choice of optimal vaccine allocation strategy, (ii) that, notwithstanding potential ethical concerns, differentiating by ethnicity in these strategies can improve outcomes (e.g., fewer deaths), and (iii) that the most likely social context in the United States is very different from the standard assumptions made by models which do not account for ethnicity and this difference affects which allocation strategy is optimal. This manuscript was submitted as part of a theme issue on “Modelling COVID-19 and Preparedness for Future Pandemics”.

AB  - Objectives
To estimate the effect of early application of social distancing interventions on Covid-19 cumulative mortality during the first pandemic wave.
Methods
Ecological longitudinal study using multivariable negative binomial regression for panel data. Daily numbers of Covid-19 cases and deaths, and data on social distancing interventions, for the 37 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) were analysed.
Results
Covid-19 cumulative mortality over the first pandemic wave varied widely across countries (range, 4.16 to 855 deaths per million population). On average, one-day delay in application of mass gatherings ban was associated with an adjusted increase in Covid-19 cumulative mortality by 6.97% (95% CI, 3.45 to 10.5), whilst a one-day delay in school closures was associated with an increase of 4.37% (95% CI, 1.58 to 7.17) over the study period. We estimated that if each country had enacted both interventions one week earlier, Covid-19 cumulative mortality could have been reduced by an average of 44.1% (95% CI, 20.2 to 67.9).
Conclusions
Early application of mass gatherings ban and school closures in outbreak epicentres was associated with an important reduction in Covid-19 cumulative mortality during the first pandemic wave. These findings may support policy decision making.

AB  - ABSTRACT
For over a year, the world has been gripped by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has had far-reaching effects on society. The integrity of national health care systems has also been challenged, owing to shifts in guidance and misinformation. Although initial reports suggested that pregnant people were not at increased risk of severe COVID-19, current data arising from the “third wave” paint a much more concerning picture. In addition, pregnant and lactating people were excluded from vaccine trials, which has hindered the ability of health care professionals to provide evidence-based counselling regarding the safety and efficacy of the available vaccines in these populations. This commentary reviews the current data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy. The evidence is clear that the risks of hospitalization and severe maternal and potentially fetal morbidity from COVID-19 in pregnancy far outweigh the very minimal risks of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy.
RÉSUMÉ
Depuis plus d'un an déjà, le monde est frappé par la pandémie de maladie à coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), dont la portée s'étend à toute la société. L'intégrité des systèmes de santé nationaux a aussi été remise en question à cause des changements de directives et de la mésinformation. Bien que les rapports initiaux aient laissé entendre que les personnes enceintes n'étaient pas plus susceptibles de développer une atteinte sévère de la COVID-19, les données actuelles colligées dans la ≪ troisième vague ≫ brossent un portrait beaucoup plus préoccupant. De plus, les personnes enceintes ou allaitantes ont été exclues des essais sur les vaccins, ce qui nuit à la capacité des professionnels de la santé de donner des conseils fondés sur des données probantes relativement à l'innocuité et à l'efficacité des vaccins disponibles chez ces populations. Le présent commentaire examine les données actuelles sur l'innocuité des vaccins anti-COVID-19 administrés pendant la grossesse. Les données montrent clairement que les risques d'hospitalisation et de morbidité maternelle, et potentiellement fœtale, grave associés à la COVID-19 pendant la grossesse sont nettement plus importants que les risques minimes associés à la vaccination contre la COVID-19 pendant la grossesse.

AB  - Acute cardiac manifestions of COVID-19 have been well described, while chronic cardiac sequelae remain less clear. Various studies have shown conflicting data on the prevalence of new or worsening cardiovascular disease, myocarditis or cardiac dysrhythmias among patients recovered from COVID-19. Data are emerging that show that patients recovering from COVID-19 have an increased incidence of myocarditis and arrhythmias after recovery from COVID-19 compared with the control groups without COVID-19. The incidence of myocarditis after COVID-19 infection is low but is still significantly greater than the incidence of myocarditis from a COVID-19 vaccine. There have been several studies of athletes who underwent a variety of screening protocols prior to being cleared to return to exercise and competition. The data show possible, probable or definite myocarditis or cardiac injury among 0.4–3.0% of the athletes studied. Recent consensus statements suggest that athletes with full recovery and absence of cardiopulmonary symptoms may return to exercise and competition without cardiovascular testing. In conclusion, patients with COVID-19 may be expected to have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, myocarditis or arrhythmias during the convalescent phase. Fortunately, the majority of patients, including athletes may return to their normal activity after recovery from COVID 19, in the absence of persisting cardiovascular symptoms.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need for the increased integration of modelling and data analysis to public health, experimental, and clinical studies. Throughout the first two years of the pandemic, there has been a concerted effort to improve our understanding of the within-host immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus to provide better predictions of COVID-19 severity, treatment and vaccine development questions, and insights into viral evolution and the impacts of variants on immunopathology. Here we provide perspectives on what has been accomplished using quantitative methods, including predictive modelling, population genetics, machine learning, and dimensionality reduction techniques, in the first 26 months of the COVID-19 pandemic approaches, and where we go from here to improve our responses to this and future pandemics.

AB  - Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) currently has few effective treatments. Given the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness and uptake of a vaccine, it is important that the search for treatments continue. An exaggerated inflammatory state is likely responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, have been shown to be associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, TNF blockade reduces not only biologically active TNF but other pro-inflammatory cytokines important in COVID-19 hyperinflammation. Observational data from patients already on anti-TNF therapy show a reduced rate of COVID-19 poor outcomes and death compared with other immune-suppressing therapies. Anti-TNF has a long history of safe use, including in special at-risk populations, and is widely available. The case to adequately assess anti-TNF as a treatment for COVID-19 is compelling.

AB  - Since its first outbreak in 2020, the pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the death of almost 7 million people worldwide. Vaccines have been fundamental in disease prevention and to reduce disease severity especially in patients with comorbidities. Nevertheless, treatment of COVID-19 has been proven difficult and several approaches have failed to prevent disease onset or disease progression, particularly in patients with comorbidities. Interrogation of drug data bases has been widely used since the beginning of pandemic to repurpose existing drugs/natural substances for the prevention/treatment of COVID-19. Steroids, including bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) have shown to be promising for their potential in modulating SARS-CoV-2/host interaction. Bile acids have proven to be effective in preventing binding of spike protein with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme II (ACE2), thus preventing virus uptake by the host cells and inhibiting its replication, as well as in indirectly modulating immune response. Additionally, the two main bile acid activated receptors, GPBAR1 and FXR, have proven effective in modulating the expression of ACE2, suggesting an indirect role for these receptors in regulating SARS-CoV-2 infectiveness and immune response. In this review we have examined how the potential of bile acids and their receptors as anti-COVID-19 therapies and how these biochemical mechanisms translate into clinical efficacy.

AB  - Introduction
Vaccination represents an important strategy to mitigate COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality by protecting against severe forms of the disease and reducing hospitalization and death rates. In this sense, the objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of Vaccination Intention (VI) against COVID-19 in Latin America and Caribbean (LAC).
Methods
We conducted a systematic review with a comprehensive search strategy for the following databases: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. A random-effect model meta-analysis was carried out using observational studies assessing the intention to vaccines against COVID-19 in LAC countries. The Clopper-Pearson method was used to estimate 95% Confidence Intervals. The quality assessment was developed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale adapted for cross-sectional studies. A subgroup analysis by study location and a sensitivity analysis were developed.
Results
Nineteen cross-sectional studies were included. Five meta-analyzes were performed according to the target population of the included studies. The VI in the general population of LAC was 78.0% (95%CI: 74.0%–82.0%). The VI for non-pregnant women was 78.0% (95%CI: 58.0%–99.0%), for elderly population was 63.0% (95%CI: 59.0%–69.0%), for pregnant women was 69.0% (95%CI: 61.0%–76.0%) and for health-personnel was 83.0% (95% CI: 71.0%–96.0%). The sensitivity analysis for general population meta-analysis that included only low risk of bias studies showed a 77.0% VI (95%CI: 73.0%–82.0%) and for non-pregnant women, 85.0% VI (95%CI: 79.0%–90.0%).
Conclusion
Despite the high prevalence of VI in general population found in our study, VI prevalence from elderly people and pregnant women are lower than other population groups and overall population.

AB  - The debate around vaccine prioritization for COVID-19 has revolved around balancing the benefits from: (1) the direct protection conferred by the vaccine amongst those at highest risk of severe disease outcomes, and (2) the indirect protection through vaccinating those that are at highest risk of being infected and of transmitting the virus. While adults aged 65+ are at highest risk for severe disease and death from COVID-19, essential service and other in-person workers with greater rates of contact may be at higher risk of acquiring and transmitting SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, there have been relatively little data available to understand heterogeneity in contact rates and risk across these demographic groups. Here, we retrospectively analyze and evaluate vaccination prioritization strategies by age and worker status. We use a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and uniquely detailed contact data collected as part of the Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Survey to evaluate five vaccination prioritization strategies: (1) prioritizing only adults over age 65, (2) prioritizing only high-contact workers, (3) splitting prioritization between adults 65+ and high-contact workers, (4) tiered prioritization of adults over age 65 followed by high-contact workers, and (5) tiered prioritization of high-contact workers followed by adults 65+. We find that for the primary two-dose vaccination schedule, assuming 70% uptake, a tiered roll-out that first prioritizes adults 65+ averts the most deaths (31% fewer deaths compared to a no-vaccination scenario) while a tiered roll-out that prioritizes high contact workers averts the most number of clinical infections (14% fewer clinical infections compared to a no-vaccination scenario). We also consider prioritization strategies for booster doses during a subsequent outbreak of a hypothetical new SARS-CoV-2 variant. We find that a tiered roll-out that prioritizes adults 65+ for booster doses consistently averts the most deaths, and it may also avert the most number of clinical cases depending on the epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 variant and the vaccine efficacy.

AB  - This study examines the association between COVID-19 mortality rates and internal conflict and investigates the possible moderating role of government economic support during the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021. Our main hypothesis suggests that countries with lower levels of government economic support are more likely to experience a positive correlation between higher COVID-19 mortality rates and the emergence of internal conflict. Using cross-country data from over 100 countries and controlling for various factors that may influence internal conflict, our analysis provides some support for this hypothesis. The results suggest a possible moderating role for government economic support, with the evidence indicating a weakening or elimination of the association between COVID-19 mortality rates and internal conflict when government economic support is adequate. However, the moderating effect of government economic support is not always significant, and caution is needed when interpreting the results. Our analysis also highlights the potential risks associated with low levels of government economic support during the pandemic. Specifically, we find that in countries where the government's macro-financial package in response to the pandemic is less than approximately 25% of GDP, there is a possible risk of growth in civil disorder resulting from increased COVID-19 deaths per million.

AB  - Summary
Background
In the 6 months following our estimates from March 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021, the proliferation of new coronavirus variants, updated mortality data, and disparities in vaccine access increased the amount of children experiencing COVID-19-associated orphanhood. To inform responses, we aimed to model the increases in numbers of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood and caregiver death, as well as the cumulative orphanhood age-group distribution and circumstance (maternal or paternal orphanhood).
Methods
We used updated excess mortality and fertility data to model increases in minimum estimates of COVID-19-associated orphanhood and caregiver deaths from our original study period of March 1, 2020–April 30, 2021, to include the new period of May 1–Oct 31, 2021, for 21 countries. Orphanhood was defined as the death of one or both parents; primary caregiver loss included parental death or the death of one or both custodial grandparents; and secondary caregiver loss included co-residing grandparents or kin. We used logistic regression and further incorporated a fixed effect for western European countries into our previous model to avoid over-predicting caregiver loss in that region. For the entire 20-month period, we grouped children by age (0–4 years, 5–9 years, and 10–17 years) and maternal or paternal orphanhood, using fertility contributions, and we modelled global and regional extrapolations of numbers of orphans. 95% credible intervals (CrIs) are given for all estimates.
Findings
The number of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood and caregiver death is estimated to have increased by 90·0% (95% CrI 89·7–90·4) from April 30 to Oct 31, 2021, from 2 737 300 (95% CrI 1 976 100–2 987 000) to 5 200 300 (3 619 400–5 731 400). Between March 1, 2020, and Oct 31, 2021, 491 300 (95% CrI 485 100–497 900) children aged 0–4 years, 736 800 (726 900–746 500) children aged 5–9 years, and 2 146 700 (2 120 900–2 174 200) children aged 10–17 years are estimated to have experienced COVID-19-associated orphanhood. Globally, 76·5% (95% CrI 76·3–76·7) of children were paternal orphans, whereas 23·5% (23·3–23·7) were maternal orphans. In each age group and region, the prevalence of paternal orphanhood exceeded that of maternal orphanhood.
Interpretation
Our findings show that numbers of children affected by COVID-19-associated orphanhood and caregiver death almost doubled in 6 months compared with the amount after the first 14 months of the pandemic. Over the entire 20-month period, 5·0 million COVID-19 deaths meant that 5·2 million children lost a parent or caregiver. Our data on children's ages and circumstances should support pandemic response planning for children globally.

AB  - Summary
The association between vaccines and peripheral facial palsy (PFP), an issue that has been the subject of debate for many years, has been raised again following results of clinical trials assessing mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines. To review the available literature on this topic, PubMed was searched from inception until February 25, 2022. Inclusion criteria were case reports with documented rechallenge and comparative epidemiological studies. Cases of COVID-19 vaccine-induced PFP with available data on vaccine rechallenge were also identified from Vigibase until December 31, 2021. Of the 347 articles retrieved, 32 comparative epidemiological studies, 1 meta-analysis and 4 case reports met our criteria, of which 13 involved COVID-19 vaccines. Eight studies found an association between at least one vaccine and the occurrence of PFP, whereas 24 did not. Positive studies involved seasonal or pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccines administered parenterally (4 studies) or intranasally (1 study with a toxin-adjuvanted vaccine), BNT162b2, a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (1 disproportionality analysis and 1 observed-to-expected analysis) and an inactivated virus COVID-19 vaccine (CoronaVac®) (1 study combining a case-control and an observed-to-expected approach). Strong evidence was found only for the intranasal influenza vaccine while other positive studies detected only a marginal association between PFP and vaccination. Of the four case reports with documented rechallenge, only two were positive and involved an influenza vaccine and tozinameran in one case each. In Vigibase, rechallenge was documented in 49 reports with 29 (59.2%) cases being negative and 20 (40.8%) positive. The available data did not confirm an excess risk of PFP after vaccination in most studies. Moreover, of the eight epidemiological studies suggesting a possible excess risk of PFP after any vaccine, three were disproportionality analyses and two observed-to excepted analyses, suggesting great caution should be taken when interpreting these results.

AB  - Objective
There is evidence of a bidirectional association between COVID-19 disease and psychiatric disorders. We aimed to assess whether exposure to psychotropic medications prior to hospitalization was associated with mortality or discharge within 30 days after hospital admission.
Methods
In this prospective study, we included all individuals with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who were admitted to the Bologna University Hospital between 1st March 2020 and 31st January 2021. We collected data about pre-existing psychiatric disorders and the use of psychotropic medications at the admission. As univariate analyses, we estimated cumulative incidence functions for 30-day mortality and discharge stratifying by exposure to each of the psychotropic medication classes. Finally, we fitted Cox regression models to estimate cause-specific Hazard Ratios (HR) of 30-day mortality and discharge. Results were adjusted for sociodemographic (age, sex), clinically relevant variables (comorbidity, c-reactive protein levels, severity of disease at presentation, history of smoking, study period), and psychiatric variables (psychiatric disorder diagnosis, number of psychotropic medications).
Results
Out of a total of 1238 hospitalized patients, 316 were prescribed psychotropic medications at the time of admission. Among these, 45 (3.6%) were taking a first-generation antipsychotics (FGA) and 66 (5.3%) a second generation antipsychotic (SGA). Exposure to SGA was associated with increased rates of 30-day mortality (HR = 2.01, 95%CI = 1.02–3.97) and exposure to FGA was associated with decreased rates of 30-day discharge (HR = 0.55, 95%CI = 0.33–0.90).
Conclusion
Patients with COVID-19 infection exposed to FGA and SGA may have worse COVID-19 infection outcomes.

AB  - "Dread risks" are threats that can have catastrophic consequences. To analyse this issue we use excess mortality and corresponding life years lost as simple measures of the severity of pandemic events. As such, they are more robust than figures from models and testing procedures that usually inform public responses. We analyse data from OECD countries that are already fully available for the whole of 2020. To assess the severity of the pandemic, we compare with historical demographic events since 1880. Results show that reports of high excess mortality during peak periods and local outbreaks should not be taken as representative. Six countries saw a somewhat more increased percentage of life years lost (over 7%), nine countries show mild figures (0–7%), while seven countries had life year gains of up to 7%. So, by historical standards, Covid-19 is worse than regular flu, but a far cry from the Spanish Flu, which has become the predominant frame of reference for the current pandemic. Even though the demographic impact is modest, psychological aspects of the pandemic can still lead to transformative futures, as the reactions of East Asian societies to SARS I in 2003 showed.

AB  - Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global emergency able to overwhelm the healthcare capacities worldwide and to affect the older generation especially. When addressing the pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, it becomes evident that the disease targets pathways and domains affected by the main aging- and frailty-related pathophysiological changes. A closer analysis of the existing data supports a possible role of biological age rather than chronological age in the prognosis of COVID-19. There is a need for systematic, consequent action of identifying frail (not only older, not only multimorbid, not only symptomatic) persons at risk of poor outcomes.

Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with severe mental illness (SMI) have worse outcomes than counterparts without SMI. Barriers in access to acute care medical procedures among SMI patients may partially explain this phenomenon. Here, we examined differences in critical care admission and in-hospital mortality between hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without SMI.
Methods
This population-based study used Spain's nationwide electronic health records. Based on International Classification Diseases, Tenth Revision, ICD-10-CM codes, we identified all patients aged ≥15 years hospitalized due to COVID-19 between July 1st-December 31st, 2020, and compared patients with and without SMI in terms of (i) critical care admission and (ii) in-hospital mortality – overall and stratified by age. We used logistic regression models including sex, age, and comorbidity burden as measured by Charlson Comorbidity Index Score as covariates.
Results
Of 118,691 hospital admissions due to COVID-19 of people aged ≥15 years, 1512 (1.3%) included a diagnosis of SMI. Compared to non-SMI patients, SMI patients had higher in-hospital mortality (OR,95%CI: 1.63,1.42–1.88) and were less frequently admitted to critical care (OR,95%CI: 0.70,0.58–0.85). Admission to critical care in SMI patients was lower than for non-SMI counterparts only among individuals aged ≥60 years. The magnitude of the difference in in-hospital mortality between SMI and non-SMI patients decreased as age increased.
Conclusions
Individuals with SMI had reduced critical care admission and increased in-hospital mortality compared non-SMI counterparts, suggesting that differences in delivery of acute care medical procedures may partially explain higher risk of negative outcomes among COVID-19 patients with SMI.

AB  - Objectives
After the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the severe COVID-19 burden falls upon immunocompromised patients who cannot mount an endogenous immune response after both vaccination and/or natural infection. They also experience persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection with high viral loads often unsuccessfully managed by the standard antiviral monotherapy regimen initially validated for treatment of COVID-19 immunocompetent patients, only. The off-label prescription of such monotherapy regimens in immunocompromised patients is likely to drive the emergence of treatment-related immune escape, relapses, excess morbidity, and mortality from both COVID-19 and delayed treatment of the underlying disorders. A possible treatment approach to mitigate such consequence is based on combined antiviral therapies.
Methods
We searched PubMed for case reports, case series and clinical trials reporting the usage of combined antiviral therapies for COVID-19.
Results
In this narrative review, we show that combinations of either small molecule antivirals or small molecule antiviral plus passive immunotherapies are safe and effective in small cohorts reported so far.
Conclusion
Considering the progressive loss of efficacy of all authorized anti-spike monoclonal antibodies, promising regimen options are reserved to combinations of small molecule antivirals and COVID-19 convalescent plasma from vaccinated donors.

AB  - On March 12th, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The collective impact of environmental and ecosystem factors, as well as biodiversity, on the spread of COVID-19 and its mortality evolution remain empirically unknown, particularly in regions with a wide ecosystem range. The aim of our study is to assess how those factors impact on the COVID-19 spread and mortality by country. This study compiled a global database merging WHO daily case reports with other publicly available measures from January 21st to May 18th, 2020. We applied spatio-temporal models to identify the influence of biodiversity, temperature, and precipitation and fitted generalized linear mixed models to identify the effects of environmental variables. Additionally, we used count time series to characterize the association between COVID-19 spread and air quality factors. All analyses were adjusted by social demographic, country-income level, and government policy intervention confounders, among 160 countries, globally. Our results reveal a statistically meaningful association between COVID-19 infection and several factors of interest at country and city levels such as the national biodiversity index, air quality, and pollutants elements (PM10, PM2.5, and O3). Particularly, there is a significant relationship of loss of biodiversity, high level of air pollutants, and diminished air quality with COVID-19 infection spread and mortality. Our findings provide an empirical foundation for future studies on the relationship between air quality variables, a country’s biodiversity, and COVID-19 transmission and mortality. The relationships measured in this study can be valuable when governments plan environmental and health policies, as alternative strategy to respond to new COVID-19 outbreaks and prevent future crises.

AB  - Summary
The Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) have experienced the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in different ways and with different timelines, with some experiencing large outbreaks leading to high levels of morbidity and mortality with significant strain on health systems, while others have had no local transmission or delayed transmission until after vaccine rollouts started. Regardless of COVID-19 trends, the pandemic has had a large impact on the social, political, and economic landscape in the Pacific, the effects of which are still being understood. However, the pandemic has also put renewed focus and investment into public health systems and provided an opportunity for the PICTs to build on existing systems and recent capacity strengthening to improve public health in the Region.

AB  - Summary
As COVID-19 evolves from a pandemic to an endemic disease, the already staggering number of people that have been or will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 is only destined to increase, and the majority of humanity will be infected. It is well understood that COVID-19, like many other viral infections, leaves a significant fraction of the infected with prolonged consequences. Continued high number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, viral evolution with escape from post-infection and vaccinal immunity, and reinfections heighten the potential impact of Long COVID. Hence, the impact of COVID-19 on human health will be seen for years to come until more effective vaccines and pharmaceutical treatments become available. To that effect, it is imperative that the mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of Long COVID be elucidated. In this article, we provide an in-depth analysis of the evidence on several potential mechanisms of Long COVID and discuss their relevance to its pathogenesis.

AB  - Objectives
Understanding the proportion of pandemic deaths captured as ‘laboratory-confirmed’ deaths is crucial. We assessed the ability of laboratory-confirmed deaths to capture mortality in the EU during the 2009 pandemic, and examined the likelihood that these findings are applicable to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Methods
We present unpublished results from the Global Pandemic Mortality (GLaMOR) project, in which country-specific mortality estimates were made for the 2009 influenza H1N1p pandemic. These estimates were compared with laboratory-confirmed deaths during the 2009 pandemic to estimate the ability of surveillance systems to capture pandemic mortality.
Results
For the 2009 influenza H1N1p pandemic, we estimated that the proportion of true pandemic deaths captured by laboratory-confirmed deaths was approximately 67%. Several differences between the two pandemics (e.g. age groups affected) make it unlikely that this capture rate will be equally high for SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusion
The surveillance of laboratory-confirmed deaths in the EU during the 2009 pandemic was more accurate than previously assumed. We hypothesize that this method is less reliable for SARS-CoV-2. Near-real-time excess all-cause mortality estimates, routinely compiled by EuroMOMO, probably offer a better indicator of pandemic mortality. We urge more countries to join this project and that national-level absolute mortality numbers are presented.

AB  - Background
Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are at high risk of thrombotic complications and organ failure, and often exhibit severe inflammation, which may contribute to hypercoagulability.
Objectives
To determine whether patients hospitalized for COVID-19 experience differing frequencies of thrombotic and organ failure complications and derive variable benefits from therapeutic-dose heparin dependent on the extent of systemic inflammation and whether observed benefit from therapeutic-dose anticoagulation varies depending on the degree of systemic inflammation.
Methods
We analyzed data from 1346 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 enrolled in the ATTACC and ACTIV-4a platforms who were randomized to therapeutic-dose heparin or usual care for whom levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were reported at baseline.
Results
Increased CRP was associated with worse patient outcomes, including a >98% posterior probability of increased organ support requirement, hospital length of stay, risk of 28-day mortality, and incidence of major thrombotic events or death (patients with CRP 40-100 mg/L or ≥100 mg/L compared to patients with CRP <40 mg/L). Patients with CRP 40 to 100 mg/L experienced the greatest degree of benefit from treatment with therapeutic doses of unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin compared with usual-care prophylactic doses. This was most significant for an increase in organ support-free days (odds ratio: 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.40; 97.9% posterior probability of beneficial effect), with trends toward benefit for other evaluated outcomes.
Conclusion
Moderately ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with CRP between 40 mg/L and 100 mg/L derived the greatest benefit from treatment with therapeutic-dose heparin.

AB  - Background/Objective
Adrenal crisis (AC) is an acute life-threatening condition that can occur in patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency who are already receiving glucocorticoid replacement therapy or can be a first presentation of adrenal insufficiency. Vaccination with tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, influenza, and pneumococcal vaccines has been reported as a cause of AC. Here, we aimed to present a case of AC precipitated by COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccination in a patient with hypopituitarism.
Case Report
A 74-year-old male patient with hypopituitarism received the second dose of the messenger RNA (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccine and after a few hours developed lethargy and confusion followed by fever. In the next day, the patient was more somnolent and unable to converse. His temperature and heart rate were 103.5 °F and 105 beats/min, respectively, and his blood pressure was 145/84 mm Hg, which decreased to 107/71 mm Hg. The patient was stuporous, responsive only to painful stimuli. A stress dose of glucocorticoids was started with improvement in all symptoms in 24 hours of treatment initiation.
Discussion
Vaccination with ChAdOx1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has been recognized as a cause of AC in patients with adrenal insufficiency. The present case report additionally demonstrates that different types of COVID-19 vaccines may be a cause of AC in patients with adrenal insufficiency.
Conclusion
A twofold to threefold increase in the maintenance dose of glucocorticoid is recommended if the patient is experiencing any symptom after COVID-19 vaccination. This treatment may reduce the risk of AC occurring after COVID-19 vaccination in patients with hypopituitarism.

AB  - Summary
Background
It is unclear what effect the pattern of health-care use before admission to hospital with COVID-19 (index admission) has on the long-term outcomes for patients. We sought to describe mortality and emergency readmission to hospital after discharge following the index admission (index discharge), and to assess associations between these outcomes and patterns of health-care use before such admissions.
Methods
We did a national, retrospective, complete cohort study by extracting data from several national databases and linking the databases for all adult patients admitted to hospital in Scotland with COVID-19. We used latent class trajectory modelling to identify distinct clusters of patients on the basis of their emergency admissions to hospital in the 2 years before the index admission. The primary outcomes were mortality and emergency readmission up to 1 year after index admission. We used multivariable regression models to explore associations between these outcomes and patient demographics, vaccination status, level of care received in hospital, and previous emergency hospital use.
Findings
Between March 1, 2020, and Oct 25, 2021, 33 580 patients were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in Scotland. Overall, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of mortality within 1 year of index admission was 29·6% (95% CI 29·1–30·2). The cumulative incidence of emergency hospital readmission within 30 days of index discharge was 14·4% (95% CI 14·0–14·8), with the number increasing to 35·6% (34·9–36·3) patients at 1 year. Among the 33 580 patients, we identified four distinct patterns of previous emergency hospital use: no admissions (n=18 772 [55·9%]); minimal admissions (n=12 057 [35·9%]); recently high admissions (n=1931 [5·8%]), and persistently high admissions (n=820 [2·4%]). Patients with recently or persistently high admissions were older, more multimorbid, and more likely to have hospital-acquired COVID-19 than patients with no or minimal admissions. People in the minimal, recently high, and persistently high admissions groups had an increased risk of mortality and hospital readmission compared with those in the no admissions group. Compared with the no admissions group, mortality was highest in the recently high admissions group (post-hospital mortality HR 2·70 [95% CI 2·35–2·81]; p<0·0001) and the risk of readmission was highest in the persistently high admissions group (3·23 [2·89–3·61]; p<0·0001).
Interpretation
Long-term mortality and readmission rates for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were high; within 1 year, one in three patients had died and a third had been readmitted as an emergency. Patterns of hospital use before index admission were strongly predictive of mortality and readmission risk, independent of age, pre-existing comorbidities, and COVID-19 vaccination status. This increasingly precise identification of individuals at high risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19 will enable targeted support.

AB  - The first case of COVID-19 in Yemen was confirmed on 10 April 2020. Having faced with a six-year long conflict that has destroyed half of its healthcare facilities and displaced millions, predictions of infections and mortality in Yemen suggested a looming healthcare catastrophe. Difficulty in implementing coordinated lockdowns and preventive measures due to the daily labor working nature of the majority of the population, provided the perfect breeding ground for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, official figures of infections and mortality are very low and there have not been confirmed reports of excess mortality. This could indicate that Yemen is silently marching towards forced herd immunity. Seroprevalence studies will provide useful insight into the COVID-19 transmission trajectory in Yemen, which can serve as a guide in planning vaccine distribution strategies and allocating the limited funds wisely.

AB  - Background
To date, it is not fully understood to what extent COVID-19 has burdened society in Japan. This study aimed to estimate the total disease burden due to COVID-19 in Japan during 2020–2021.
Methods
We stratify disease burden estimates by age group and present it as absolute Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) lost and QALYs lost per 100,000 persons. The total estimated value of QALYs lost consists of (1) QALYs lost brought by deaths due to COVID-19, (2) QALYs lost brought by inpatient cases, (3) QALYs lost brought by outpatient cases, and (4) QALYs lost brought by long-COVID.
Results
The total QALYs lost due to COVID-19 was estimated as 286,782 for two years, 114.0 QALYs per 100,000 population per year. 71.3% of them were explained by the burden derived from deaths. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the burden of outpatient cases was the most sensitive factor.
Conclusions
The large part of disease burden due to COVID-19 in Japan from the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2021 was derived from Wave 3, 4, and 5 and the proportion of QALYs lost due to morbidity in the total burden increased gradually. The estimated disease burden was smaller than that in other high-income countries. It will be our future challenge to take other indirect factors into consideration.

AB  - Rationale & Objective
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness and immunogenicity threshold associated with protection against COVID-19–related hospitalization or death in the dialysis population are unknown.
Study Design
Retrospective, observational study.
Setting & Participants
Adult patients without COVID-19 history receiving maintenance dialysis through a national dialysis provider and treated between February 1 and December 18, 2021, with follow-up through January 17, 2022.
Predictor
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status.
Outcomes
All SARS-CoV-2 infections, composite of hospitalization or death following COVID-19.
Analytical Approach
Logistic regression was used to determine COVID-19 case rates and vaccine effectiveness.
Results
Of 16,213 patients receiving dialysis during the study period, 12,278 (76%) were fully vaccinated, 589 (4%) were partially vaccinated, and 3,346 (21%) were unvaccinated by the end of follow-up. Of 1,225 COVID-19 cases identified, 550 (45%) occurred in unvaccinated patients, and 891 (73%) occurred during the Delta variant–dominant period. Between the pre-Delta period and the Delta-dominant period, vaccine effectiveness rates against a severe COVID-19–related event (hospitalization or death) were 84% and 70%, respectively. In the subset of 3,202 vaccinated patients with at least one anti-spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) assessment, lower anti-spike IgG levels were associated with higher case rates per 10,000 days and higher adjusted hazard ratios for infection and COVID-19–related hospitalization or death.
Limitations
Observational design, residual biases, and confounding may exist.
Conclusions
Among maintenance dialysis patients, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 diagnosis and associated hospitalization or death. Among vaccinated patients, a low anti-spike IgG level is associated with worse COVID-19–related outcomes.

AB  - In this paper we derive a theoretical model of the spread of a viral infection which we use as basis for an estimation strategy to test four interrelated hypotheses on the relationship between country-level COVID-19 mortality rates and the extent of urban development. Using data covering 81 countries we find evidence that countries with a higher population density, a higher share of the urban population living in the largest city, and countries with a higher urbanization rate had on average the same or fewer COVID-19 fatalities compared to less urbanized countries in 2020. Even though COVID-19 spreads faster in cities, fatalities may be lower, conditional on economic development, trust in government, and a well-functioning health care system. Generally, urbanization and city development are associated with economic development: with the resources urbanized countries have, it is easier for them to manage and maintain stricter lockdowns, and to roll out effective pharmaceutical interventions.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection evokes severe proinflammatory storm and pulmonary infection with the number of confirmed cases (more than 200 million) and mortality (5 million) continue to surge globally. A number of vaccines (e.g., Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson/Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines) have been developed over the past two years to restrain the rapid spread of COVID-19. However, without much of effective drug therapies, COVID-19 continues to cause multiple irreversible organ injuries and is drawing intensive attention for cell therapy in the management of organ damage in this devastating COVID-19 pandemic. For example, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have exhibited promising results in COVID-19 patients. Preclinical and clinical findings have favored the utility of stem cells in the management of COVID-19-induced adverse outcomes via inhibition of cytokine storm and hyperinflammatory syndrome with coinstantaneous tissue regeneration capacity. In this review, we will discuss the existing data with regards to application of stem cells for COVID-19.

AB  - The global anxiety and economic crisis causes the deadly pandemic coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID 19) affect millions of people right now. Subsequently, this life threatened viral disease is caused due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, morbidity and mortality of infected patients are due to cytokines storm syndrome associated with lung injury and multiorgan failure caused by COVID 19. Thereafter, several methodological advances have been approved by WHO and US-FDA for the detection, diagnosis and control of this wide spreadable communicable disease but still facing multi-challenges to control. Herein, we majorly emphasize the current trends and future perspectives of nano-medicinal based approaches for the delivery of anti-COVID 19 therapeutic moieties. Interestingly, Nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with drug molecules or vaccines resemble morphological features of SARS-CoV-2 in their size (60–140 nm) and shape (circular or spherical) that particularly mimics the virus facilitating strong interaction between them. Indeed, the delivery of anti-COVID 19 cargos via a nanoparticle such as Lipidic nanoparticles, Polymeric nanoparticles, Metallic nanoparticles, and Multi-functionalized nanoparticles to overcome the drawbacks of conventional approaches, specifying the site-specific targeting with reduced drug loading and toxicities, exhibit their immense potential. Additionally, nano-technological based drug delivery with their peculiar characteristics of having low immunogenicity, tunable drug release, multidrug delivery, higher selectivity and specificity, higher efficacy and tolerability switch on the novel pathway for the prevention and treatment of COVID 19.

AB  - Summary
There is a need for safe and effective platform vaccines to protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other infectious diseases. In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2/3 trial, we evaluate the safety and efficacy of a multi-dose Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 and other infectious disease in a COVID-19-unvaccinated, at-risk-community-based cohort. The at-risk population is made of up of adults with type 1 diabetes. We enrolled 144 subjects and randomized 96 to BCG and 48 to placebo. There were no dropouts over the 15-month trial. A cumulative incidence of 12.5% of placebo-treated and 1% of BCG-treated participants meets criteria for confirmed COVID-19, yielding an efficacy of 92%. The BCG group also displayed fewer infectious disease symptoms and lesser severity and fewer infectious disease events per patient, including COVID-19. There were no BCG-related systemic adverse events. BCG’s broad-based infection protection suggests that it may provide platform protection against new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and other pathogens.

We use global data on cases and deaths, and public health and economic policy responses to the pandemic, to illustrate the alternative past and potential future trajectories of the pandemic. Shocks to labor and sectoral productivity, consumption, government expenditure, and country and sector risk premia are used within a global multisectoral intertemporal general equilibrium model: G-Cubed, to assess the economic impacts of COVID-19 under those scenarios. We illustrate the vital role of public health responses in managing a pandemic and restoring confidence among economic agents. The role of global coordination amidst a pandemic is also highlighted. We also compare the GDP projections under the alternative scenarios with the actual GDP outcomes in 2020 and 2021. Despite the uncertainties regarding the health outcomes of COVID-19 and the health and economic policy responses to the pandemic, we demonstrate that the actual outcomes lie within those projected for the scenarios.

AB  - Summary
Current evidence suggests that severity and mortality of COVID-19 is higher in men than in women, whereas women might be at increased risk of COVID-19 reinfection and development of long COVID. Differences between sexes have been observed in other infectious diseases and in the response to vaccines. Sex-specific expression patterns of proteins mediating virus binding and entry, and divergent reactions of the immune and endocrine system, in particular the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, in response to acute stress might explain the higher severity of COVID-19 in men. In this Personal View, we discuss how sex hormones, comorbidities, and the sex chromosome complement influence these mechanisms in the context of COVID-19. Due to its role in the severity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we argue that sexual dimorphism has potential implications for disease treatment, public health measures, and follow-up of patients predisposed to the development of long COVID. We suggest that sex differences could be considered in future pandemic surveillance and treatment of patients with COVID-19 to help to achieve better disease stratification and improved outcomes.

AB  - Background
Cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of sudden out-of-hospital death after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. Such unexpected COVID-19-related cardiomyopathies are challenging to diagnose as specific pathological findings are not always identified.
Case summary
We reported the autopsy findings of two cases of sudden death due to COVID-19-related cardiomyopathies. In one case, death occurred after SARS-CoV-2 infection, while in the other, after COVID-19 vaccination. We found common pathological findings in both hearts: decreased staining intensity with special stains, loss of rhabdomeres, and multivacuolation in cardiomyocytes without inflammatory cell infiltration. The remaining organs showed no findings that could have contributed to the deaths.
Conclusion
In cases of sudden death after SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination, the decreased staining intensity with special stains may aid the diagnosis of sudden death due to COVID-19-related cardiomyopathy, even when H&E staining shows few findings.

AB  - The AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine is associated with Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) in 3/100,000 vaccinations with high fatality rates reported in many countries. We conducted a risk–benefit analysis for Australians aged 18–59 years, comparing the risk of vaccination versus infection, and rate of TTS to other vaccines which prompted policy change following rare adverse events – rotavirus, smallpox and oral polio vaccines. COVID-19 deaths over 12 months range from 0 to 417 in current and future worst case scenarios. In the past 15 months 20 COVID-19 deaths occurred in people < 60 years compared to 890 deaths over 60 years. The estimated possible number of TTS cases is 347, with vaccine-related deaths ranging from 17 to 153if 80% of adults 18–59 years are vaccinated. The reported rate of TTS is in the same range as rare but serious adverse events associated with other vaccines that have been subject to policy change. In Australia, the potential risks of the AZD1222 vaccine in younger adults, who are at low risk of dying from COVID-19, may outweigh the benefits.

AB  - Background
Patients with diabetes and obesity are populations at high-risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes and have shown blunted immune responses when administered different vaccines. Here we used the ‘ANRS0001S COV-POPART’ French nationwide multicenter prospective cohort to investigate early humoral response to COVID-19 vaccination in the sub-cohort (‘COVPOP OBEDIAB’) of patients with obesity and diabetes.
Methods
Patients with diabetes (n = 390, type 1 or 2) or obesity (n = 357) who had received two vaccine doses and had no history of previous COVID-19 infection and negative anti-nucleocapsid (NCP) antibodies were included and compared against healthy subjects (n = 573). Humoral response was assessed at baseline, at one month post-first dose (M0) and one-month post-second dose (M1), through percentage of responders (positive anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (Sabs), geometric means of Sabs; BAU/mL), proportion of individuals with anti-RBD antibodies, and proportion of individuals with anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (Nabs). Potential clinical and biological factors associated with weak response (defined as Sabs < 264 BAU/mL) and presence of non-reactive anti-RBD antibodies at M1 were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate regressions were performed to estimate crude and adjusted coefficients with 95 % confidence intervals. Poor glycemic control was defined as HbA1c ≥ 7.5 % at inclusion.
Results
Patients with diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, and patients with obesity were less likely to have positive Sabs and anti-RBD antibodies after the first and second dose compared to controls (p < 0.001). At M1, we found Sabs seroconversion in 94.1 % of patients with diabetes versus 99.7 % in controls, anti-RBD seroconversion in 93.8 % of patients with diabetes versus 99.1 % in controls, and Nabs seroconversion in 95.7 % of patients with diabetes versus 99.6 % in controls (all p < 0.0001). Sabs and anti-RBD seroconversion at M0 and M1 were also significantly lower in obese patients than controls, at respectively 82.1 % versus 89.9 % (p = 0.001; M0 Sabs), 94.4 % versus 99.7 % (p 0.001; M1 Sabs), 79.0 % vs 86.2 % (p = 0.004 M0 anti-RBD), and 96.99 % vs 99.1 % (p = 0.012 M1 anti-RBD). The factors associated with low vaccine response (BAU < 264/mL) in patients with diabetes were chronic kidney disease (adjusted OR = 6.88 [1.77;26.77], p = 0.005) and poor glycemic control (adjusted OR = 3.92 [1.26;12.14], p = 0.018). In addition, BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 was found to be associated with a higher vaccine response (adjusted OR = 0.10 [0.01;0.91], p = 0.040) than patients with BMI < 40 kg/m2.
Conclusion
COVID-19 vaccine humoral response was lower in patients with obesity and diabetes one month after second dose compared to controls, especially in diabetic patients with CKD or inadequate glycemic control. These findings point to the need for post-vaccination serological checks in these high-risk populations.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and its variants have brought unprecedented impacts to the global public health system, politics, economy, and other fields. Although more than ten COVID-19 specific vaccines have been approved for emergency use, COVID-19 prevention and control still face many challenges. Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) is the only authorized vaccine used to fight against tuberculosis (TB), it has been hypothesized that BCG may prevent and control COVID-19 based on BCG-induced nonspecific immune responses. Herein, we summarized: 1) The nonspecific protection effects of BCG, such as prophylactic protection effects of BCG on nonmycobacterial infections, immunotherapy effects of BCG vaccine, and enhancement effect of BCG vaccine on unrelated vaccines; 2) Recent evidence of BCG's efficacy against SARS-COV-2 infection from ecological studies, analytical analyses, clinical trials, and animal studies; 3) Three possible mechanisms of BCG vaccine and their effects on COVID-19 control including heterologous immunity, trained immunity, and anti-inflammatory effect. We hope that this review will encourage more scientists to investigate further BCG induced non-specific immune responses and explore their mechanisms, which could be a potential tool for addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19-like “Black Swan” events to reduce the impacts of infectious disease outbreaks on public health, politics, and economy.

Drawing on Canada as a case study, we summarize the primary and secondary impacts of COVID-19 on immigrants. We find that recent and female immigrants as well refugees have fared far worse than either their more established and male counterparts or the Canadian-born population. We then discuss how COVID-19 might influence (or weaken) immigrants' previously documented health advantage. We highlight two structural conditions induced by the pandemic that may alter the health profile of immigrants; namely, immigration policy and delayed medical treatments. Reflections on the requisite data for monitoring and tracking the overall impact of COVID-19 on immigrants' health are included. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the Canadian patterns and its potential relevance to immigrants and the HIE in the United States.

AB  - During outbreaks, natural disasters, and any unexpected event, it is usual that public authorities face issues tracking the outcomes, and the available reports of casualties tend to be lower than actual numbers. Using weekly data at the municipality level in São Paulo State (the most densely populated region in Brazil), we employ stochastic frontier methods to fit the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak spanning from March 2020 to December 2021. The empirical model incorporates the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation to address the issue of zero reporting of COVID-19 deaths. Furthermore, we utilize a flexible frontier method to capture the S-shaped epidemic curve in two distinct waves of infections/deaths. Our results reveal that the actual death toll resulting from COVID-19 is, on average, 1.24 times higher than the officially reported figures. Consequently, these findings hold significant implications for public authorities in identifying regions characterized by substantial under-reporting of COVID-19 fatalities. Moreover, this study presents an empirical framework that can be used for other municipalities, states, or countries confronting outbreak scenarios.

AB  - Background
In response to COVID-19, the Swedish government imposed few travel and mobility restrictions. This contrasted with its Scandinavian neighbours which implemented stringent restrictions. The influence these different approaches had on mobility, and thus on COVID-19 mortality was investigated.
Methods
Datasets indicating restriction severity and community mobility were examined; Google's ‘Community Movement Reports' (CMR) show activity at key location categories; the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker collates legislative restrictions into a ‘Stringency Index’ (SI).
Results
CMR mobility categories were negatively correlated with COVID-19 mortality. The strongest correlations were obtained by negatively time lagging mortality data, suggesting restrictions had a delayed influence. During the ‘first wave’ a model using SI (AIC 632.87) proved favorable to one using contemporaneous CMR data and SI (AIC 1193.84), or lagged CMR data and SI (AIC 642.35). Validation using ‘second wave’ data confirmed this; the model using SI solely again being optimal (RMSE: 0.2486 vs. 0.522 and 104.62). Cross-country differences were apparent in all models; Swedish data, independent of SI and CMR, proved significant throughout. There was a significant association for Sweden and the death number across models.
Conclusion
SI may provide a broader, more accurate, representation of changes in movement in response to COVID-19 restrictions.

We assessed short-, medium-, and long-term all-cause mortality risks after a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods
A national, matched, retrospective cohort study was conducted in Qatar to assess risk of all-cause mortality in the national SARS-CoV-2 primary infection cohort compared with the national infection-naïve cohort. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. Analyses were stratified by vaccination status and clinical vulnerability status.
Results
Among unvaccinated persons, within 90 days after primary infection, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) comparing mortality incidence in the primary-infection cohort with the infection-naïve cohort was 1.19 (95% confidence interval 1.02-1.39). aHR was 1.34 (1.11-1.63) in persons more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19 and 0.94 (0.72-1.24) in those less clinically vulnerable. Beyond 90 days after primary infection, aHR was 0.50 (0.37-0.68); aHR was 0.41 (0.28-0.58) at 3-7 months and 0.76 (0.46-1.26) at ≥8 months. The aHR was 0.37 (0.25-0.54) in more clinically vulnerable persons and 0.77 (0.48-1.24) in less clinically vulnerable persons. Among vaccinated persons, mortality incidence was comparable in the primary-infection versus infection-naïve cohorts, regardless of clinical vulnerability status.
Conclusions
COVID-19 mortality was primarily driven by an accelerated onset of death among individuals who were already vulnerable to all-cause mortality, but vaccination prevented these accelerated deaths.

AB  - It is always challenging to diagnose a disease using a biosensor reliably, and quickly with high sensitivity and selectivity, simultaneosuly. Recently the world experienced a global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Although the vaccines are available, COVID-19 resulted a huge threat to the entire world with high mortality rates. Irrespective of a specific disease, there is a constant need for a cheaper and faster in-vitro, lab-on-a-chip sensor with high sensitivity and selectivity. Such sensors will not only facilitate the disease detection but will expedite and vaccine development process through detection of its corresponding antibodies when developed. In this article, we present an ultrasonic guided wave sensor using 128° YX lithium niobate piezoelectric wafer, specially designed in a shape of a multi-threaded comb with cantilever beams which is equally selective and sensitive for the detection of corresponding antigen-antibody assays. As a proof of concept in this article, the diagnostic sensor is created and tested for detection of SARS-COV-2 antibodies. Sensors were functionalized with SARS-COV-2 antigens and target antibody for the same was detected. Unique and judicially tuned acoustic features are analyzed for successful detection of the right antibodies. The proposed lab-on-a-chip device utilizes a wide range of diagnostic frequencies resulting into a highly sensitive platform for the diagnostics even to the slightest biophysical changes. The proposed sensor is also believed to extend to the detection of various other antigens/antibodies of different diseases in the future.
