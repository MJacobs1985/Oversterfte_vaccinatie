AB  - Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the male sex is a significant risk factor for severe disease and mortality due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the precise explanation for the discrepancy is currently unclear. Immunologically, the female-biased protection against COVID-19 could presumably be due to a more rapid and robust immune response to viruses exhibited by males. The female hormones, e.g., estrogens and progesterone, may have protective roles against viral infections. In contrast, male hormones, e.g., testosterone, can act oppositely. Besides, the expression of the ACE-2 receptor in the lung and airway lining, which the SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter cells, is more pronounced in males. Estrogen potentially plays a role in downregulating the expression of ACE-2, which could be a plausible biological explanation for the reduced severity of COVID-19 in females. Comorbidities, e.g., cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and kidney disorders, are considered significant risk factors for severe outcomes in COVID-19. Age-adjusted data shows that males are statistically more predisposed to these morbidities—amplifying risks for males with COVID-19. In addition, many sociocultural factors and gender-constructed behavior of men and women impact exposure to infections and outcomes. In many parts of the world, women are more likely to abide by health regulations, e.g., mask-wearing and handwashing, than men. In contrast, men, in general, are more involved with high-risk behaviors, e.g., smoking and alcohol consumption, and high-risk jobs that require admixing with people, which increases their risk of exposure to the infection. Overall, males and females suffer differently from COVID-19 due to a complex interplay between many biological and sociocultural factors.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already affected millions of people worldwide. There are reports of SARS-CoV-2 transmission as a consequence of environmental contamination. The SARS-CoV-2 laden infective droplets can actively persist on the surface of different materials for several hours to days. Sunlight can affect the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in these aerosols and thereby have an impact on the decay rate of the virus. Solar radiation might play an important role in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 that persists in different surfaces and the environment. Among the different climatological factors, ultraviolet radiation was found to have an important role in determining the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Although ultraviolet radiation C (UVC), UVB, UVA, visible light, and infrared radiation possess germicidal properties, human CoVs including the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 are inherently sensitive to UVC. However, the successful decontamination using other wavebands requires higher dosages and longer administration times. Furthermore, studies have also identified association between COVID-19 fatalities and the latitude. The intensity of sunlight is highest near the equator, and therefore populations in these regions with more regular exposure to sunlight are less susceptible to vitamin D deficiency. This article has analyzed the potential impact of sunlight in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, morbidity, and mortality. It is evident that there exists an interesting link between sunlight exposure, latitude, and vitamin D status with COVID-19 incidence, fatality and recovery rates that requires further investigation.

AB  - Summary
Background
Estimates of immunity and severity for the SARS-CoV-2 omicron subvariant BA.5 are important to assess the public health impact associated with its rapid global spread despite vaccination. We estimated natural and vaccine immunity and severity of BA.5 relative to BA.2 in Denmark, a country with high mRNA-vaccination coverage and free-of-charge RT-PCR testing.
Methods
This nation-wide population-based study in Denmark included residents aged 18 years or older who had taken an RT-PCR test between 10 April and 30 June, 2022 (ie, the outcome period), and who the national COVID-19 surveillance system identified as having information since February 2020 on RT-PCR tests, whole-genome sequencing, vaccinations, and hospitalisation with a positive RT-PCR test and COVID-19 as the main diagnosis. First, we used a case–control design, in which cases were people infected with BA.5 or BA.2 during the outcome period and controls were people who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection during the outcome period. We calculated the protection provided by a previous PCR-confirmed omicron infection against BA.5 and BA.2 infection and hospitalisation among triple-vaccinated individuals. Second, we compared vaccination status in people infected with BA.5 versus BA.2 and estimated relative vaccine protection against each subvariant. Third, we compared rates of hospitalisation for COVID-19 among people infected with BA.5 versus BA.2. We estimated effects using logistic regression with adjustment for sex, age, region, PCR-test date, comorbidity and, as appropriate, vaccination and previous infection status.
Findings
A total of 210 (2·4%) of 8678 of BA.5 cases, 192 (0·7%) of 29 292 of BA.2 cases, and 33 972 (19·0%) of 178 669 PCR-negative controls previously had an omicron infection, which was estimated in the adjusted analyses to offer 92·7% (95% CI 91·6–93·7) protection against BA.5 infection and 97·1% (96·6–97·5) protection against BA.2 infection. We found similarly high amounts of protection against hospitalisation owing to infection with BA.5 (96·4% [95% CI 74·2–99·5]) and BA.2 (91·2% [76·3–96·7]). Vaccine coverage (three mRNA doses vs none) was 9307 (94·2%) of 9878 among BA.5 cases and 30 581 (94·8%) of 32 272 among BA.2 cases, although in the adjusted analysis, there was a trend towards slightly higher vaccination coverage among BA.5 cases than BA.2 cases (OR 1·18 [95% CI 0·99–1·42]; p=0·064), possibly suggesting marginally poorer vaccine protection against BA.5. The rate of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 was higher among the BA.5 cases (210 [1·9%] of 11 314) than among the BA.2 cases (514 [1·4%] of 36 805), with an OR of 1·34 (95% CI 1·14–1·57) and an adjusted OR of 1·69 (95% CI 1·22–2·33), despite low and stable COVID-19 hospitalisation numbers during the study period.
Interpretation
The study provides evidence that a previous omicron infection in triple-vaccinated individuals provides high amounts of protection against BA.5 and BA.2 infections. However, protection estimates greater than 90% might be too high if individuals with a previous infection were more likely than those without one to come forward for a test for reasons other than suspicion of COVID-19. Our analysis also showed that vaccine protection against BA.5 infection was similar to, or slightly weaker than, protection against BA.2 infection. Finally, there was evidence that BA.5 infections were associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation compared with BA.2 infections.

AB  - Vaccines developed in high-income countries have been enormously successful in reducing the global burden of infectious diseases, saving perhaps 2.5 million lives per year, but even for successful cases, like the rotavirus vaccine, global implementation may take a decade or more. For unincentivized vaccines, the delays are even more profound, as both the supply of a vaccine from developing country manufacturers and vaccine demand from countries with the high disease burdens have to be generated in order for impact to be manifest. A number of poverty-associated infectious diseases, whose burden is greatest in low-income and middle-income countries, would benefit from appropriate levels of support for vaccine development such as Group A Streptococcus, invasive non-typhoid salmonella, schistosomiasis, shigella, to name a few. With COVID-19 vaccines we will hopefully be able to provide novel vaccine technology to all countries through a unique collaborative effort, the COVAX facility, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), Gavi, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Whether this effort can deliver vaccine to all its participating countries remains to be seen, but this ambitious effort to develop, manufacture, distribute, and vaccinate 60–80% of the world’s population will hopefully be a lasting legacy of COVID-19.

AB  - Background
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Although general and local public health report deathly cases, case fatality rates are still largely unknown. Thus, we sought to evaluate the mortality of COVID-19.
Methods
We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for articles evaluating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients that included clinical outcomes, between December 2020 and 24 April 2020. Two authors performed an independent selection using predefined terms of search.
Results
We retrieved 33 studies with a total of 13,398 patients with COVID-19 diagnosis. The mortality rate of the COVID‐19 patients was 17.1% (95% CI 12.7; 22.7, I2 = 96.9%). For general patients admitted to the hospital (excluding critical care-only studies) the mortality rate of the COVID‐19 was 11.5% (95% CI 7.7; 16.9, I2 = 96.7%). Among critical illness studies (n = 7) we found a 40.5% mortality (95% CI 31.2; 50.6, I2 = 91.8%).
Conclusion
High COVID-19 mortality among general admitted patients and critical care cases should guide resources allocations and economic burden calculations during the pandemics.

The studied database, expressed in terms of both population and air pollution (particulate) indicators, is provided mainly by the Airly company, the Central Statistical Office (GUS) and the Rogalski project. The particular measured factors, which underwent standardization, were assessed for mutual dependency by means of a Pearson correlation coefficient and analysed by a linear regression. Based on the presented models, our results indicate that air quality (air pollution level) is the most important factor in the context of enabling COVID-19 case load increase in Poland.

AB  - Summary
The Coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization. Since then, the scientific community has been actively engaged in developing a vaccine against the dreaded disease. Considerable research has also been performed for drugs that can directly interfere with the viral replication pathway. However, the production of these vaccines and drugs demands a lot of time and effort which is undesirable considering the pace at which the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading across the continents. For this reason, the possible role of dietary nutrients in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as mitigating the symptoms, may be explored. These natural substances are readily available, have negligible side effects and confer several benefits to the immune system. Macronutrients like proteins are vital for antibody production. Dietary constituents such as omega-3-fatty acids, vitamin C, vitamin E, phytochemicals such as carotenoids and polyphenols exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This review highlights the significance of relevant nutrients in boosting the immune system.

AB  - Background
Prior studies of COVID-19 cardiovascular sequelae include diagnoses made within 4 weeks, but the World Health Organization definition for “postacute phase” is >3 months.
Objectives
The purpose of this study was to determine which cardiovascular diagnoses in the postacute phase of COVID-19 are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods
Retrospective cohort study of all adults in Alberta who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021, matched (by age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity score, and test date) with controls who had a negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test.
Results
The 177,892 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (mean age 42.7 years, 49.7% female) were more likely to visit an emergency department (5.7% vs 3.3%), be hospitalized (3.4% vs 2.1%), or die (1.3% vs 0.4%) within 1 month than matched test-negative controls. After 3 months, cases were significantly more likely than controls to have an emergency department visit or hospitalization for diabetes mellitus (1.5% vs 0.7%), hypertension (0.6% vs 0.4%), heart failure (0.2% vs 0.1%), or kidney injury (0.3% vs 0.2%). In the 6,030 patients who had survived a hospitalization for COVID-19, postacute phase risks were substantially greater for diabetes mellitus (9.5% vs 3.0%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.16 [95% CI: 2.43-4.12]), hypertension (3.5% vs 1.4%, aOR: 2.89 [95% CI: 1.97-4.23]), heart failure (2.1% vs 0.7%, aOR: 3.16 [95% CI: 1.88-5.29]), kidney injury (3.1% vs 0.8%, aOR: 2.70 [95% CI: 1.71-4.28]), bleeding (1.5% vs 0.5%, aOR: 3.40 [95% CI: 1.83-6.32]), and venous thromboembolism (0.8% vs 0.3%, aOR: 3.60 [95% CI: 1.59-8.13]).
Conclusions
Clinicians should screen COVID-19 survivors for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, and kidney dysfunction in the postacute phase.

AB  - The COVID-19 global pandemic has caused about 4,30 Mln deaths. Recently the first vaccines have been licensed, representing the most powerful weapon available to stop the pandemic. The COVID-19 viral infection in the most severe cases can cause severe lung lesions with the presence of ﬁbrotic tissue. Even among cured individuals, the presence of pulmonary fibrotic tissue may be the major cause of long-term complications of COVID-19 requiring antifibrotic therapeutic treatment even in the post-COVID-19 infection phase to accelerate the healing process and fully recover lung function. This article reviews the fibrogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-induced viral damage and the antifibrotic treatments indicated to treat sequelae post COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an unprecedented disease caused by highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 and characterized by extreme respiratory deterrence, pneumonia and immune damage. The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the sequence similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other SARS-like bat viruses. The primary source and intermediate host are not yet confirmed, although transmission from human to human is universally confirmed. The new SARS-CoV-2 virus reaches cells via ACE-2 and subsequently down-regulates ACE-2, leaving angiotensin II unbalanced in affected organs primarily in the lungs, heart, brain, and kidneys. As reported recently, numerous secondary complications i.e., neurological, nephrological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune, and hepatic complications, are associated with COVID-19 infection along with prominent respiratory disease including pneumonia. Extensive research work on recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 is in the pipeline to clarify pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiological features, and identify new drug targets that will lead to the development of successful strategies for prevention and treatment. There are currently no appropriate scientifically approved vaccines/drugs for COVID-19. Nonetheless, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, azithromycin were tested against COVID-19 in clinical trials, and finally, FDA approved emergency use of remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Additionally, administration of convalescent plasma obtained from recovered COVID-19 patients to infected COVID-19 patients reduces the viral burden via immunomodulation. This review analysis therefore concentrates primarily on recent discoveries related to COVID-19 pathogenesis along with a full description of the structure, genome, and secondary complication associated with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, a short and brief clinical update has been provided concerning the development of therapeutic medications and vaccines to counter COVID-19.

AB  - The climate crisis impacts child health, increasing the burden of pediatric healthcare. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ecological footprint of pediatric healthcare has significantly increased due to the use of personal protective equipment and the provision of large-scale testing and vaccination against COVID-19. The situation calls for coordinated action to make pediatric healthcare more resource-efficient. To achieve this goal, pediatricians should work together with children and parents in order to appropriately minimize the use of electricity, water, paper and plastic and promote environmental sustainability in healthcare and beyond. The present article discusses the main sources of environmental pollution in pediatric healthcare and proposes evidence-based solutions.

AB  - Summary
Background
The transmission dynamics of influenza were affected by public health and social measures (PHSMs) implemented globally since early 2020 to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to assess the effect of COVID-19 PHSMs on the transmissibility of influenza viruses and to predict upcoming influenza epidemics.
Methods
For this modelling study, we used surveillance data on influenza virus activity for 11 different locations and countries in 2017–22. We implemented a data-driven mechanistic predictive modelling framework to predict future influenza seasons on the basis of pre-COVID-19 dynamics and the effect of PHSMs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We simulated the potential excess burden of upcoming influenza epidemics in terms of fold rise in peak magnitude and epidemic size compared with pre-COVID-19 levels. We also examined how a proactive influenza vaccination programme could mitigate this effect.
Findings
We estimated that COVID-19 PHSMs reduced influenza transmissibility by a maximum of 17·3% (95% CI 13·3–21·4) to 40·6% (35·2–45·9) and attack rate by 5·1% (1·5–7·2) to 24·8% (20·8–27·5) in the 2019–20 influenza season. We estimated a 10–60% increase in the population susceptibility for influenza, which might lead to a maximum of 1–5-fold rise in peak magnitude and 1–4-fold rise in epidemic size for the upcoming 2022–23 influenza season across locations, with a significantly higher fold rise in Singapore and Taiwan. The infection burden could be mitigated by additional proactive one-off influenza vaccination programmes.
Interpretation
Our results suggest the potential for substantial increases in infection burden in upcoming influenza seasons across the globe. Strengthening influenza vaccination programmes is the best preventive measure to reduce the effect of influenza virus infections in the community.

AB  - While COVID-19, the disease driven by SARS-CoV-2 has ignited interest in the host immune response to this infection, it has also highlighted the lack of treatment options for the damaging inflammatory responses driven by pathogens that precipitate the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). With the global prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the likelihood of a second winter spike alongside seasonal flu, the need for effective and targeted anti-inflammatory agents is even more pressing. Here we discuss the aetiology of COVID-19 and the common signalling pathways driven by SARS-CoV-2, namely p38 MAP kinase. We highlight that p38 MAP kinase becomes elevated with increasing age, thereby driving many of the inflammatory pathways that precipitate death in old people with the added drawback of impairing vaccine efficacy in this susceptible age group. Finally, we review drugs available to inhibit p38 MAP kinase, their risks-versus-benefits as well as suggested dosing regimen to combat over-exuberant innate immune responses and potentially reverse vaccine inefficacy in older patients.

AB  - Several COVID-19 patients frequently experience with happy hypoxia. Sometimes, the level of nitric oxide (NO) in COVID-19 patients was found to be greater than in non-COVID-19 hypoxemics and most of the cases lower. Induced or inhaled NO has a long history of usage as a therapy for hypoxemia. Excessive production of ROS and oxidative stress lower the NO level and stimulates mitochondrial malfunction is the primary cause of hypoxia-mediated mortality in COVID-19. Higher level of NO in mitochondria also the cause of dysfunction, because, excess NO can also diffuse quickly into mitochondria or through mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase (NOS). A precise dose of NO may increase oxygenation while also acting as an effective inhibitor of cytokine storm. NOS inhibitors may be used in conjunction with iNO therapy to compensate for the patient's optimal NO level. NO play a key role in COVID-19 happy hypoxia and a crucial component in the COVID-19 pathogenesis that demands a reliable and easily accessible biomarker to monitor.

AB  - Diabetes, one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world, is strongly associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Scrupulous blood sugar management is crucial, since the worse outcomes are closely associated with higher blood sugar levels in COVID-19 infection. Although recent observational studies showed that insulin was associated with mortality, it should not deter insulin use in hospitalized patients requiring tight glucose control. Back and forth dilemma in the past with regards to continue/discontinue certain medications used in diabetes have been mostly resolved. The initial fears of consequences related to continuing certain medications have been largely dispelled. COVID-19 also necessitates the transformation in diabetes care through the integration of technologies. Recent advances in health-related technologies, notably telemedicine and remote continuous glucose monitoring, have become essential in the management of diabetes during the pandemic. Today, these technologies have changed the landscape of medicine and become more important than ever. Being a high-risk population, patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, should be prioritized for vaccination. In the future, as the pandemic fades, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases is expected to rise due to lifestyle changes and medical issues/dilemma encountered during the pandemic.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the rapidly spreading pandemic COVID-19 in the world. As an effective therapeutic strategy is not introduced yet and the rapid genetic variations in the virus, there is an emerging necessity to design, evaluate and apply effective new vaccines. An acceptable vaccine must elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses, must have the least side effects and the storage and transport systems should be available and affordable for all countries. These vaccines can be classified into different types: inactivated vaccines, live-attenuated virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA and RNA) and recombinant vector-based vaccines (replicating and non-replicating viral vector). According to the latest update of the WHO report on April 2nd, 2021, at least 85 vaccine candidates were being studied in clinical trial phases and 184 candidate vaccines were being evaluated in pre-clinical stages. In addition, studies have shown that other vaccines, including the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine and the Plant-derived vaccine, may play a role in controlling pandemic COVID-19. Herein, we reviewed the different types of COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are currently being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trial phases along with advantages, disadvantages or adverse reactions, if any.

AB  - Background
Regular physical activity (PA) has been postulated to improve, or at least maintain, immunity across the life span. However, the link between physical (in)activity and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains to be established. This small-scale prospective cohort study is nested within a randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the possible associations between PA levels and clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.
Methods
Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (mean age: 54.9 years) were recruited from the Clinical Hospital of the School of Medicine of the University of Sao Paulo (a quaternary referral teaching hospital) and from Ibirapuera Field Hospital, both located in Sao Paulo, Brazil. PA level was assessed using the Baecke Questionnaire of Habitual Physical Activity. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay. The secondary outcomes were mortality, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and mechanical ventilation requirement.
Results
The median hospital length of stay was 7.0 ± 4.0 days, median ± IQR; 3.3% of patients died, 13.8% were admitted to the ICU, and 8.6% required mechanical ventilation. Adjusted linear regression models showed that PA indices were not associated with hospital length of stay (work index: β = –0.57 (95% confidence interval (95%CI): –1.80 to 0.65), p = 0.355; sport index: β = 0.43 (95%CI: –0.94 to 1.80), p = 0.536; leisure-time index: β = 1.18 (95%CI: –0.22 to 2.59), p = 0.099; and total activity index: β = 0.20 (95%CI: –0.48 to 0.87), p = 0.563). None of the PA indices were associated with mortality, admission to the ICU, or mechanical ventilation requirement (all p > 0.050).
Conclusion
Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, PA did not independently associate with hospital length of stay or any other clinically relevant outcomes. These findings should be interpreted as meaning that, among already hospitalized patients with more severe forms of COVID-19, being active is a potential protective factor likely outweighed by a cluster of comorbidities (e.g., type 2 diabetes, hypertension, weight excess) and older age, suggesting that the benefit of PA against the worsening of COVID-19 may vary across stages of the disease.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections present with increased disease severity and poor clinical outcomes in diabetic patients compared with their nondiabetic counterparts. Diabetes/hyperglycemia-triggered endothelial dysfunction and hyperactive inflammatory and immune responses are correlated to twofold to threefold higher intensive care hospitalizations and more than twice the mortality among diabetic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. While comorbidities such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension worsen the prognosis of diabetic COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 infections are also associated with new-onset diabetes, severe metabolic complications, and increased thrombotic events in the backdrop of aberrant endothelial function. While several antidiabetic medications are used to manage blood glucose levels, we discuss the multifaceted ability of metformin to control blood glucose levels and possibly attenuate endothelial dysfunction, inhibit viral entry and infection, and modify inflammatory and immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infections. These actions make metformin a viable candidate drug to be considered for repurposing and gaining ground against the SARS-CoV-2-induced tsunami in diabetic COVID-19 patients.

KW  - Screening hesitancy
KW  - Voluntary rapid antigen test
AB  - Background
The Hong Kong government distributed rapid antigen test (RAT) kits to households across the city and called for a universal voluntary testing exercise for three consecutive days during the Omicron wave to identify infected persons early for quarantine and disrupt transmission chains in the community. We conducted a survey to evaluate the participation rates and explore the determinants of voluntary RAT adoption and hesitancy.
Methods
This cross-sectional survey was conducted through computer-assisted telephone interviews from 19 May to 16 June 2022 using an overlapping dual-frame telephone number sampling design. Information on willingness to adopt voluntary RAT, four themes of personal qualities, attitudes toward the government’s health policies, incentives to motivate RAT adoption, and personal sociodemographic factors were collected. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the factors associated with RAT adoption.
Results
Of the 1010 participants, 490 successfully responded to the fixed-line and 520 to the mobile phone survey, with response rates of 1.42% and 1.63% and screen hesitancy rates of 36.1% and 39.3%, respectively. Participants of adoption RAT were those aged 30–49 years, with high perceived COVID-19 infection severity, ≥ 3 doses of COVID-19 vaccination, and more agreement with the health policies on material resources and quarantine orders. Individuals who were less risk seeking and more altruistic reported a higher adoption of voluntary RAT.
Conclusions
Understanding the willingness to participate in a voluntary universal testing programme might shed light on effective ways to minimise screening hesitancy in future public health strategies and campaigns.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic 2nd wave catastrophic effect in the state of Chhattisgarh, India, from where no exclusive genomic data yet published, has prompted us to undertake this study to unearth the causative variant. Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from COVID-19 infected nine vaccinated healthcare workers (HCW), thirty mild/moderate, seventeen severe, and twenty-seven deceased patients, was performed. The significant predominance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC), Delta (lineage B.1.617.2) identified in sixty-four (77.1%) cases in contrast to B.1 and its sublineage in eleven (13.2%), variant under monitoring (VUM), Kappa (lineage B.1.617.1) in five (6.0%) and another VOC Alpha (lineage B.1.1.7) in three (3.6%) cases respectively (p < 0.05, χ2 = 162.49). 88.8% vaccine breakthrough, 60% mild/moderate, 94.4% severe and 81.5% dead patients were infected by Delta. Kappa presents exclusively in mild/moderate, Alpha in vaccine breakthrough, mild/moderate, and dead patient and B.1 and its sublineages in mild, severe, and dead patient categories. Delta variant spike mutation of T19R, G142D, E156G, L452R, and deletion (F157 and R158) helps in escaping antibody response, T478K and D614G enhance viral affinity with ACE2 receptor while P681R and D950N result in higher replication and transmissibility by cleaving S1/S2 at furin site. We conclude that Delta variant predominant role along with co-occurrence of Kappa, Alpha, and B.1 variant during COVID-19 2nd wave pandemic in Chhattisgarh may pose a potential threat of future outbreak through hybrid variant evolution. Thus, intensive genomic surveillance for monitoring variant evolution and a more efficacious vaccine against the Delta and Alpha variants are required.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 initially infects cells in the nasopharynx and oral cavity. The immune system at these mucosal sites plays a crucial role in minimizing viral transmission and infection. To develop new strategies for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, this study aimed to identify proteins that protect against viral infection in saliva. We collected 551 saliva samples from 290 healthcare workers who had tested positive for COVID-19, before vaccination, between June and December 2020. The samples were categorized based on their ability to block or enhance infection using in vitro assays. Mass spectrometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments were used to identify and measure the abundance of proteins that specifically bind to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Immunoglobulin (Ig)A specific to SARS-CoV-2 antigens was detectable in over 83% of the convalescent saliva samples. We found that concentrations of anti-receptor-binding domain IgA >500 pg/µg total protein in saliva correlate with reduced viral infectivity in vitro. However, there is a dissociation between the salivary IgA response to SARS-CoV-2, and systemic IgG titers in convalescent COVID-19 patients. Then, using an innovative technique known as spike-baited mass spectrometry, we identified novel spike-binding proteins in saliva, most notably vimentin, which correlated with increased viral infectivity in vitro and could serve as a therapeutic target against COVID-19.

AB  - The rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus and its high death rate have surprised many countries around the world. In such a situation, a lack of proper positioning against this disaster can lead to irreparable and long-term damages. Through designing a comparative interdependent platform in two phases of COVID-19's outbreak-epidemic and pandemic, this paper investigates the positioning of 8 African countries, including Egypt, South Africa, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Nigeria, Cameroon, and Kenya, based on the composite indices of social permeability, coping potential and social vulnerability. Further, using the k-means approach, the under-study countries are involved in some dominant clusters by which their surrounding features compared to each other are implied. To reduce the risk arising from disasters such as COVID-19, the decision tree method is taken to extract patterns indicating the risk of vulnerability in the future. The results of the carried out analyses prove that Algeria has the most preferable position in the social permeability index and Tunisia has the most coping potential compared to other countries. On the other hand, Cameroon and Egypt have had relatively less vulnerability in dealing with COVID-19, which can lead to valuable management perspectives. The performed clustering depicts that the dominant clusters include 0–1) Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia, 2–4) South Africa, 1-2-4) Algeria, and 3) Nigeria, Kenya, and Cameroon. Tracing the branches of the decision tree can also facilitate achieving different vulnerability ranges and guide the adoption of appropriate policies to balance the influencing factors and reduce their adverse effects.

AB  - Summary
Background
We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) in health-care workers in South Africa during two waves of the South African COVID-19 epidemic.
Methods
In the single-arm, open-label, phase 3B implementation Sisonke study, health-care workers aged 18 years and older were invited for vaccination at one of 122 vaccination sites nationally. Participants received a single dose of 5 × 1010 viral particles of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Vaccinated participants were linked with their person-level data from one of two national medical insurance schemes (scheme A and scheme B) and matched for COVID-19 risk with an unvaccinated member of the general population. The primary outcome was vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19, defined as COVID-19-related admission to hospital, hospitalisation requiring critical or intensive care, or death, in health-care workers compared with the general population, ascertained 28 days or more after vaccination or matching, up to data cutoff. This study is registered with the South African National Clinical Trial Registry, DOH-27-022021-6844, ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04838795, and the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, PACTR202102855526180, and is closed to accrual.
Findings
Between Feb 17 and May 17, 2021, 477 102 health-care workers were enrolled and vaccinated, of whom 357 401 (74·9%) were female and 119 701 (25·1%) were male, with a median age of 42·0 years (33·0–51·0). 215 813 vaccinated individuals were matched with 215 813 unvaccinated individuals. As of data cutoff (July 17, 2021), vaccine effectiveness derived from the total matched cohort was 83% (95% CI 75–89) to prevent COVID-19-related deaths, 75% (69–82) to prevent COVID-19-related hospital admissions requiring critical or intensive care, and 67% (62–71) to prevent COVID-19-related hospitalisations. The vaccine effectiveness for all three outcomes were consistent across scheme A and scheme B. The vaccine effectiveness was maintained in older health-care workers and those with comorbidities including HIV infection. During the course of the study, the beta (B.1.351) and then the delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns were dominant, and vaccine effectiveness remained consistent (for scheme A plus B vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related hospital admission during beta wave was 62% [95% CI 42–76] and during delta wave was 67% [62–71], and vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related death during beta wave was 86% [57–100] and during delta wave was 82% [74–89]).
Interpretation
The single-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine shows effectiveness against severe COVID-19 disease and COVID-19-related death after vaccination, and against both beta and delta variants, providing real-world evidence for its use globally.

AB  - Transplant centers seeking to increase coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine coverage may consider requiring vaccination for healthcare workers or for candidates. The authors summarize current data to inform an ethical analysis of the harms, benefits, and individual and societal impact of mandatory vaccination, concluding that vaccine requirements for healthcare workers and transplant candidates are ethically justified by beneficence, net utility, and fiduciary duty to patients and public health. Implementation strategies should mitigate concerns about respect for autonomy and transparency for both groups. We clarify how the same arguments might be applied to related questions of caregiver vaccination, allocation of other healthcare resources, and mandates for non-COVID-19 vaccines. Finally, we call for effort to achieve global equity in vaccination as soon as possible.

AB  - Objectives
In the first months of 2021, the Dutch COVID-19 vaccination campaign was disturbed by reports of death in Norwegian nursing homes (NHs) after vaccination. Reports predominantly concerned persons >65 years of age with 1 or more comorbidities. Also, in the Netherlands adverse events were reported after COVID-19 vaccination in this vulnerable group. Yet, it was unclear whether a causal link between vaccination and death existed. Therefore, we investigated the risk of death after COVID-19 vaccination in Dutch NH residents compared with the risk of death in NH residents prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Design
Population-based longitudinal cohort study with electronic health record data.
Setting and Participants
We studied Dutch NH residents from 73 NHs who received 1 or 2 COVID-19 vaccination(s) between January 13 and April 16, 2021 (n = 21,762). As a historical comparison group, we included Dutch NH residents who were registered in the same period in 2019 (n = 27,591).
Methods
Data on vaccination status, age, gender, type of care, comorbidities, and date of NH entry and (if applicable) discharge or date of death were extracted from electronic health records. Risk of death after 30 days was evaluated and compared between vaccinated residents and historical comparison residents with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Regression analyses were adjusted for age, gender, comorbidities, and length of stay.
Results
Risk of death in NH residents after one COVID-19 vaccination (regardless of whether a second vaccination was given) was decreased compared with historical comparison residents from 2019 (adjusted HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.86). The risk of death further decreased after 2 vaccinations compared with the historical comparison group (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.50-0.64).
Conclusions and Implications
We found no indication that risk of death in NH residents is increased after COVID-19 vaccination. These results indicate that COVID-19 vaccination in NH residents is safe and could reduce fear and resistance toward vaccination.

AB  - Objectives
To characterize the plasma immune profile of patients with tuberculosis (TB)-COVID-19 compared with COVID-19, TB, or healthy controls and to evaluate in vitro the specific responses to SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-antigens.
Methods
We enrolled 119 subjects: 14 TB-COVID-19, 47 COVID-19, 38 TB, and 20 controls. The plasmatic levels of 27 immune factors were measured at baseline using a multiplex assay. The specific response to SARS-CoV-2 and Mtb antigens was evaluated using a home-made whole blood platform and QuantiFERON-Plus tubes, respectively.
Results
We found an immune signature (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, and interleukin [IL]-9) associated with TB-COVID-19 coinfection compared with COVID-19 (P <0.05), and TNF-α showed the highest discriminant power. We also found another signature (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-17A, IL-5, fibroblast growth factor-basic, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) in coinfected patients compared with patients with TB (P <0.05), and among them, TNF-α and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor showed a non-negligible discriminating ability. Moreover, coinfected patients showed a significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2-specific response compared with COVID-19 for several pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and growth factors (P ≤0.05). Furthermore, coinfection negatively affected the Mtb-specific response (P ≤0.05).
Conclusion
We found immune signatures associated with TB-COVID-19 coinfection and observed a major impairment of SARS-CoV-2-specific and, to a lesser extent, the Mtb-specific immune responses. These findings further advance our knowledge of the immunopathology of TB-COVID-19 coinfection.

AB  - Disproportionate mortality and morbidity burdens of the COVID-19 pandemic and coinciding media coverage of public acts of violence perpetrated against people of color in 2020 precipitated reckonings with structural inequities in global, national, and local contexts. This cross-country comparative analysis aims to describe how people voice and make sense race, racism, and privilege in their experiences with COVID-19 infection in the United States, United Kingdom, and Brazil. Anchored by continuous reflection on our individual and collective positionality, we conducted an inductive comparative analysis conceptually situated in intersectionality and critical race theory. Countries used a shared qualitative methodology to collect and analyze 166 narratives of people with experience of COVID-19 infection from 2020 to 2023. We selected 19 cases that illustrate cross-national differences in peoples’ acknowledgment and narration of structural privilege and disadvantage in their observations of COVID-19 in their countries and in their personal experiences. People in the US had the most fluency with voicing race directly. In Brazil, while some respondents (especially younger people) demonstrated high racial consciousness, others struggled to identify and talk about racial relationships. In the UK, people voiced racial identifications, though often within white norms of politeness and an accompanying sense of discomfort. The findings overall illustrate moments the interview becomes or does not become a space for voicing social categories and systemic underpinnings of difference in COVID-19 infections and healthcare experiences. We reflect on cross-country differences in historical and contemporary racialized discourse and elaborate on implications of focusing on voicing in qualitative research.

AB  - This study analyzes the impact of COVID-19 full vaccination shocks on the US stock market in the period January 14, 2021– August 20, 2021. Using the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag model, we find that the positive and negative COVID-19 full vaccination growth shocks have a positive and symmetrical impact on the US stock market over the long run. Additionally, the short-run findings provide that the US stock market reacts negatively with delay to the positive and negative COVID-19 full vaccination growth shocks. The study findings provide good insights that COVID-19 full vaccination immunizes accordingly to the S&P 500 index in the long run. The study results indicate that the impact of positive and negative COVID-19 full vaccination growth shocks on the stock market in the short run differs from that in the long run. This research bears important implications: governments should implement preventive measures with vaccination to recover the stock market. Policy makers ought to urge adopting policy measures to reduce panic and boost investor confidence during economic and health crises.

AB  - Background
The risk factors that emerge with the onset and protraction of humanitarian crises leave populations at a heightened risk of excess morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). There is currently little clarity on which vaccines are being used in crises throughout the world, and whether vaccination decisions correspond to local disease threats. This review aimed to collect and analyse such information.
Methods
We reviewed vaccination services from January 2015 to June 2019 across all 25 humanitarian responses that had an activated coordination mechanism during this period. A range of online sources and informants within the humanitarian sector were consulted to compile data on which vaccines were provided in each crisis, and the modality and timing of vaccine provision. The package of vaccination services since the start of each crisis was then compared with local disease burden (baseline + excess due to crisis-emergent risk factors).
Results
The range of vaccines used in humanitarian crises appears limited. When offered, vaccines were primarily delivered through the pre-existing routine schedule, with few supplementary actions taken in recognition of the need for rapidly enhancing population immunity. Vaccine packages mostly did not address the actual range of VPDs that likely accounted for substantial disease risk.
Conclusions
This review suggests inconsistencies and inequities in vaccine provision to crisis-affected populations. A consistent, standardised and broader approach to vaccine use in crises is needed.

AB  - Summary
Background
National rates of COVID-19 infection and fatality have varied dramatically since the onset of the pandemic. Understanding the conditions associated with this cross-country variation is essential to guiding investment in more effective preparedness and response for future pandemics.
Methods
Daily SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths for 177 countries and territories and 181 subnational locations were extracted from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's modelling database. Cumulative infection rate and infection-fatality ratio (IFR) were estimated and standardised for environmental, demographic, biological, and economic factors. For infections, we included factors associated with environmental seasonality (measured as the relative risk of pneumonia), population density, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, proportion of the population living below 100 m, and a proxy for previous exposure to other betacoronaviruses. For IFR, factors were age distribution of the population, mean body-mass index (BMI), exposure to air pollution, smoking rates, the proxy for previous exposure to other betacoronaviruses, population density, age-standardised prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer, and GDP per capita. These were standardised using indirect age standardisation and multivariate linear models. Standardised national cumulative infection rates and IFRs were tested for associations with 12 pandemic preparedness indices, seven health-care capacity indicators, and ten other demographic, social, and political conditions using linear regression. To investigate pathways by which important factors might affect infections with SARS-CoV-2, we also assessed the relationship between interpersonal and governmental trust and corruption and changes in mobility patterns and COVID-19 vaccination rates.
Findings
The factors that explained the most variation in cumulative rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection between Jan 1, 2020, and Sept 30, 2021, included the proportion of the population living below 100 m (5·4% [4·0–7·9] of variation), GDP per capita (4·2% [1·8–6·6] of variation), and the proportion of infections attributable to seasonality (2·1% [95% uncertainty interval 1·7–2·7] of variation). Most cross-country variation in cumulative infection rates could not be explained. The factors that explained the most variation in COVID-19 IFR over the same period were the age profile of the country (46·7% [18·4–67·6] of variation), GDP per capita (3·1% [0·3–8·6] of variation), and national mean BMI (1·1% [0·2–2·6] of variation). 44·4% (29·2–61·7) of cross-national variation in IFR could not be explained. Pandemic-preparedness indices, which aim to measure health security capacity, were not meaningfully associated with standardised infection rates or IFRs. Measures of trust in the government and interpersonal trust, as well as less government corruption, had larger, statistically significant associations with lower standardised infection rates. High levels of government and interpersonal trust, as well as less government corruption, were also associated with higher COVID-19 vaccine coverage among middle-income and high-income countries where vaccine availability was more widespread, and lower corruption was associated with greater reductions in mobility. If these modelled associations were to be causal, an increase in trust of governments such that all countries had societies that attained at least the amount of trust in government or interpersonal trust measured in Denmark, which is in the 75th percentile across these spectrums, might have reduced global infections by 12·9% (5·7–17·8) for government trust and 40·3% (24·3–51·4) for interpersonal trust. Similarly, if all countries had a national BMI equal to or less than that of the 25th percentile, our analysis suggests global standardised IFR would be reduced by 11·1%.
Interpretation
Efforts to improve pandemic preparedness and response for the next pandemic might benefit from greater investment in risk communication and community engagement strategies to boost the confidence that individuals have in public health guidance. Our results suggest that increasing health promotion for key modifiable risks is associated with a reduction of fatalities in such a scenario.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant global impact, resulting in long-term health effects for many individuals. As more patients recover, there is a growing need to identify effective management strategies for ongoing health concerns, such as post-COVID-19 syndrome, characterized by persistent symptoms or complications beyond several weeks or months from the onset of symptoms. In this review, we explore the potential of dietary polysaccharides as a promising approach to managing post-COVID-19 syndrome. We summarize the immunomodulatory, antioxidant, antiviral, and prebiotic activities of dietary polysaccharides for the management of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Furthermore, the review investigates the role of polysaccharides in enhancing immune response, regulating immune function, improving oxidative stress, inhibiting virus binding to ACE2, balancing gut microbiota, and increasing functional metabolites. These properties of dietary polysaccharides may help alleviate COVID-19 symptoms, providing a promising avenue for effective treatment strategies.

AB  - Governments implemented countermeasures to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. This had a severe effect on the economy. We examine convergence patterns in the evolution of COVID-19 deaths across countries. We aim to investigate whether countries that implemented different measures managed to limit the number of COVID-19 deaths. We extend the most recent macro-growth convergence methodology to examine convergence of COVID-19 deaths. We combine a long memory stationarity framework with the maximal clique algorithm. This provides a rich and flexible club formation strategy that goes beyond the stationary/non stationary approach adopted in the previous literature. Our results suggest that strict measures (even belated) or an aggressive vaccination scheme can confine the spread of the disease while maintaining the strictness of the measures steady can lead to a burst of the virus. Finally, we observe that fiscal measures did not have an effect on the containment of the virus.

AB  - The assessment of hospitalisations and intensive care is crucial for planning health care resources needed over the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nonetheless, comparative empirical assessments of COVID-19 hospitalisations and related fatality risk patterns on a large scale are lacking. This paper exploits anonymised, individual-level data on SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infections collected and harmonized by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to profile the demographics of COVID-19 hospitalised patients across nine European countries during the first pandemic wave (February – June 2020). We estimate the role of demographic factors for the risk of in-hospital mortality, and present a case study exploring individuals’ comorbidities based on a subset of COVID-19 hospitalised patients available from the Dutch health system. We find that hospitalisation rates are highest among individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who are not only older than 70 years, but also 50-69 years. The latter group has a longer median time between COVID-19 symptoms’ onset and hospitalisation than those aged 70+ years. Men have higher hospitalisation rates than women at all ages, and particularly above age 50. Consistently, men aged 50-59 years have a probability of hospitalisation almost double than women do. Although the gender imbalance in hospitalisation remains above age 70, the gap between men and women narrows at older ages. Comorbidities play a key role in explaining selection effects of COVID-19 confirmed positive cases requiring hospitalisation. Our study contributes to the evaluation of the COVID-19 burden on the demand of health-care during emergency phases. Assessing intensity and timing dimensions of hospital admissions, our findings allow for a better understanding of COVID-19 severe outcomes. Results point to the need of suitable calibrations of epidemiological projections and (re)planning of health services, enhancing preparedness to deal with infectious disease outbreaks.

AB  - Zoonotic viruses originate from birds or animal sources and responsible for disease transmission from animals to people through zoonotic spill over and presents a significant global health concern due to lack of rapid diagnostics and therapeutics. The Corona viruses (CoV) were known to be transmitted in mammals. Early this year, SARS-CoV-2, a novel strain of corona virus, was identified as the causative pathogen of an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China. The disease later named corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), subsequently spread across the globe rapidly. Nano-particles and viruses are comparable in size, which serves to be a major advantage of using nano-material in clinical strategy to combat viruses. Nanotechnology provides novel solutions against zoonotic viruses by providing cheap and efficient detection methods, novel, and new effective rapid diagnostics and therapeutics. The prospective of nanotechnology in COVID 19 is exceptionally high due to their small size, large surface-to-volume ratio, susceptibility to modification, intrinsic viricidal activity. The nano-based strategies address the COVID 19 by extending their role in i) designing nano-materials for drug/vaccine delivery, ii) developing nano-based diagnostic approaches like nano-sensors iii) novel nano-based personal protection equipment to be used in prevention strategies.This review aims to bring attention to the significant contribution of nanotechnology to mitigate against zoonotic viral pandemics by prevention, faster diagnosis and medication point of view.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented health, economic, and social consequences worldwide. Although contact reductions and wearing face coverings have reduced infection rates, and vaccines have reduced illness severity, emergence of new variants of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and the shift from pandemic to endemic patterns of infection, highlights the importance of ongoing preventive behavior adherence to manage future outbreaks. Research applying social cognition theories may assist in explaining variance in these behaviors and inform the development of efficacious behavior change interventions to promote adherence. In the present article, we summarize research applying these theories to identify modifiable determinants of COVID-19 preventive behaviors and the mechanisms involved, and their utility in informing interventions. We identify limitations of these applications (e.g., overreliance on correlational data, lack of long-term behavioral follow-up), and suggest how they can be addressed. We demonstrate the virtue of augmenting theories with additional constructs (e.g., moral norms, anticipated regret) and processes (e.g., multiple action phases, automatic processes) to provide comprehensive, parsimonious behavioral explanations. We also outline how the theories contribute to testing mechanisms of action of behavioral interventions. Finally, we recommend future studies applying these theories to inform and test interventions to promote COVID-19 preventive behavior adherence.

AB  - Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted vaccination services and raised the risk of a global resurgence of preventable diseases. We assessed the extent of and reasons for missed or delayed vaccinations (hereafter ‘missed’) in middle- and high-income countries in the early months of the pandemic.
Methods
From May to June 2020, participants completed an online survey on missed vaccination. Analyses separated missed childhood and adult vaccination in middle-and high-income countries.
Results
Respondents were 28,429 adults from 26 middle- and high-income countries. Overall, 9% of households had missed a vaccine, and 13% were unsure. More households in middle- than high-income countries reported missed childhood vaccination (7.6% vs. 3.0%) and missed adult vaccination (9.6% vs. 3.4%, both p < .05). Correlates of missed childhood vaccination in middle-income countries included COVID-19 risk factors (respiratory and cardiovascular diseases), younger age, male sex, employment, psychological distress, larger household size, and more children. In high-income countries, correlates of missed childhood vaccination also included immunosuppressive conditions, but did not include sex or household size. Fewer correlates were associated with missed adult vaccination other than COVID-19 risk factors and psychological distress. Common reasons for missed vaccinations were worry about getting COVID-19 at the vaccination clinic (15%) or when leaving the house (11%). Other reasons included no healthcare provider recommendation, clinic closure, and wanting to save services for others.
Interpretation
Missed vaccination was common and more prevalent in middle- than high-income countries. Missed vaccination could be mitigated by emphasizing COVID-19 safety measures in vaccination clinics, ensuring free and accessible immunization, and clear healthcare provider recommendations.

KW  - Vaccine hesitancy
AB  - Background
Prior research has highlighted racial and ethnic disparities in H1N1 vaccination in the United States. Our study adds to this literature by utilizing an intersectionality framework to examine the joint influence of race and sex on H1N1 vaccination beliefs and behaviors among non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites (hereafter blacks and whites).
Methods
Using data from the National H1N1 Flu Survey of U.S. adults, we measured differences in beliefs about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine among black women, black men, white women, and white men. We then estimated a series of nested logistic regression models to examine how race/sex vaccination disparities were influenced by health beliefs, socioeconomic status (SES), pre-existing conditions, and healthcare.
Results
Black respondents were more likely than white respondents to express reservations about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine. Consistent with those beliefs, white females reported the highest rate of H1N1 vaccination (28.4%), followed by white males (26.3%), black males (21.6%), and black females (17.5%). Differences in health beliefs, SES, pre-existing conditions, and healthcare explained lower odds of H1N1 vaccination among white men and black men, relative to white women. However, black women experienced 35–45% lower odds of vaccination than white women across all models, highlighting the intersectional nature of these associations.
Discussion
The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provides a cautionary tale about the distribution of new vaccines across large populations with diverse racial, sex, and socioeconomic characteristics. Despite differences between the H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics, our study warns that many black Americans will forego COVID-19 vaccines unless swift action is taken to address black-white disparities in access to vital resources. Public health stakeholders can also encourage widespread adoption of COVID-19 vaccines by tailoring health promotion messages for different groups of racial minorities, especially groups like black women who face intersecting disadvantages.

AB  - Background
Multiple prediction models were developed for critical outcomes of COVID-19. However, prediction models using predictors which can be easily obtained in clinical practice and on dental status are scarce.
Aim
The study aimed to develop and externally validate prediction models for critical outcomes of COVID-19 for unvaccinated adult patients in hospital settings based on demographics, medical conditions, and dental status.
Methods
A total of 285 and 352 patients from two hospitals in the Netherlands were retrospectively included as derivation and validation cohorts. Demographics, medical conditions, and dental status were considered potential predictors. The critical outcomes (death and ICU admission) were considered endpoints. Logistic regression analyses were used to develop two models: for death alone and for critical outcomes. The performance and clinical values of the models were determined in both cohorts.
Results
Age, number of teeth, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases were the significant independent predictors. The models showed good to excellent calibration with observed: expected (O:E) ratios of 0.98 (95%CI: 0.76 to 1.25) and 1.00 (95%CI: 0.80 to 1.24), and discrimination with shrunken area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.85 and 0.79, based on the derivation cohort. In the validation cohort, the models showed good to excellent discrimination with AUC values of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.80 to 0.90) and 0.78 (95%CI: 0.73 to 0.83), but an overestimation in calibration with O:E ratios of 0.65 (95%CI: 0.49 to 0.85) and 0.67 (95%CI: 0.52 to 0.84).
Conclusion
The performance of the models was acceptable in both derivation and validation cohorts. Number of teeth was an additive important predictor of critical outcomes of COVID-19. It is an easy-to-apply tool in hospitals for risk stratification of COVID-19 prognosis.

AB  - As the COVID-19 pandemic poses serious threats to global public health, Nigeria faces a potential public health crisis owing to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, such as Lassa fever (LF) and malaria. In this study, we discuss the possible determinants behind the decreased number of LF cases in Nigeria, which was likely due to the synergistic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the epidemic curve of LF seems to have deviated from the general seasonal scale seen in past years, which could be due to underreporting of cases. In addition, partial compliance with nonpharmaceutical interventions, limited resources, or human behavior could be contributing factors. Thus, we suggest that better differentiation in terms of human and resource allocation between COVID-19 and LF could help curtail the transmission effectively.

AB  - In this perspective, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on tuberculosis (TB)/HIV health services and approaches to mitigating the growing burden of these three colliding epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). SSA countries bear significantly high proportions of TB and HIV cases reported worldwide, compared to countries in the West. Whilst COVID-19 epidemiology appears to vary across Africa, most countries in this region have reported relatively lower-case counts compared to the West. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has added an additional burden to already overstretched health systems in SSA, which, among other things, have been focused on the longstanding dual epidemics of TB and HIV. As with these dual epidemics, inadequate resources and poor case identification and reporting may be contributing to underestimations of the COVID-19 case burden in SSA. Modelling studies predict that the pandemic-related disruptions in TB and HIV services will result in significant increases in associated morbidity and mortality over the next five years. Furthermore, limited empirical evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 coinfections with TB and HIV are associated with increased mortality risk in SSA. However, predictive models require a better evidence-base to accurately define the impact of COVID-19, not only on communicable diseases such as TB and HIV, but on non-communicable disease comorbidities. Further research is needed to assess morbidity and mortality data among both adults and children across the African continent, paying attention to geographic disparities, as well as the clinical and socio-economic determinants of COVID-19 in the setting of TB and/or HIV.

AB  - We sought to better understand the immune response during the immediate post-diagnosis phase of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by identifying molecular associations with longitudinal disease outcomes. Multi-omic analyses identified differences in immune cell composition, cytokine levels, and cell subset-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures between individuals on a more serious disease trajectory (Progressors) as compared to those on a milder course (Non-progressors). Higher levels of multiple cytokines were observed in Progressors, with IL-6 showing the largest difference. Blood monocyte cell subsets were also skewed, showing a comparative decrease in non-classical CD14−CD16+ and intermediate CD14+CD16+ monocytes. In lymphocytes, the CD8+ T effector memory cells displayed a gene expression signature consistent with stronger T cell activation in Progressors. These early stage observations could serve as the basis for the development of prognostic biomarkers of disease risk and interventional strategies to improve the management of severe COVID-19.
Background
Much of the literature on immune response post-SARS-CoV-2 infection has been in the acute and post-acute phases of infection.
Translational significance
We found differences at early time points of infection in approximately 160 participants. We compared multi-omic signatures in immune cells between individuals progressing to needing more significant medical intervention and non-progressors. We observed widespread evidence of a state of increased inflammation associated with progression, supported by a range of epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic signatures. The signatures we identified support other findings at later time points and serve as the basis for prognostic biomarker development or to inform interventional strategies.

AB  - Summary
T cell responses play an important role in protection against beta-coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, where they associate with decreased COVID-19 disease severity and duration. To enhance T cell immunity across epitopes infrequently altered in SARS-CoV-2 variants, we designed BNT162b4, an mRNA vaccine component that is intended to be combined with BNT162b2, the spike-protein-encoding vaccine. BNT162b4 encodes variant-conserved, immunogenic segments of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, membrane, and ORF1ab proteins, targeting diverse HLA alleles. BNT162b4 elicits polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to diverse epitopes in animal models, alone or when co-administered with BNT162b2 while preserving spike-specific immunity. Importantly, we demonstrate that BNT162b4 protects hamsters from severe disease and reduces viral titers following challenge with viral variants. These data suggest that a combination of BNT162b2 and BNT162b4 could reduce COVID-19 disease severity and duration caused by circulating or future variants. BNT162b4 is currently being clinically evaluated in combination with the BA.4/BA.5 Omicron-updated bivalent BNT162b2 (NCT05541861).

AB  - Objective
This sequential, prospective meta-analysis sought to identify risk factors among pregnant and postpartum women with COVID-19 for adverse outcomes related to disease severity, maternal morbidities, neonatal mortality and morbidity, and adverse birth outcomes.
Data Sources
We prospectively invited study investigators to join the sequential, prospective meta-analysis via professional research networks beginning in March 2020.
Study Eligibility Criteria
Eligible studies included those recruiting at least 25 consecutive cases of COVID-19 in pregnancy within a defined catchment area.
Methods
We included individual patient data from 21 participating studies. Data quality was assessed, and harmonized variables for risk factors and outcomes were constructed. Duplicate cases were removed. Pooled estimates for the absolute and relative risk of adverse outcomes comparing those with and without each risk factor were generated using a 2-stage meta-analysis.
Results
We collected data from 33 countries and territories, including 21,977 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy or postpartum. We found that women with comorbidities (preexisting diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease) vs those without were at higher risk for COVID-19 severity and adverse pregnancy outcomes (fetal death, preterm birth, low birthweight). Participants with COVID-19 and HIV were 1.74 times (95% confidence interval, 1.12–2.71) more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit. Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy were at higher risk of intensive care unit admission (relative risk, 5.53; 95% confidence interval, 2.27–13.44), ventilation (relative risk, 9.36; 95% confidence interval, 3.87–22.63), and pregnancy-related death (relative risk, 14.10; 95% confidence interval, 2.83–70.36). Prepregnancy obesity was also a risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes including intensive care unit admission (relative risk, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.26–2.60), ventilation (relative risk, 2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–3.51), any critical care (relative risk, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.28–2.77), and pneumonia (relative risk, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.18–2.33). Anemic pregnant women with COVID-19 also had increased risk of intensive care unit admission (relative risk, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.25–2.11) and death (relative risk, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–4.81).
Conclusion
We found that pregnant women with comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease were at increased risk for severe COVID-19–related outcomes, maternal morbidities, and adverse birth outcomes. We also identified several less commonly known risk factors, including HIV infection, prepregnancy underweight, and anemia. Although pregnant women are already considered a high-risk population, special priority for prevention and treatment should be given to pregnant women with these additional risk factors.

AB  - Summary
Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has negatively affected access to healthcare systems and treatment timelines. This study was designed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
Methods
From January 2019 to December 2020, 489,001 patients from 1068 institutions were registered in the Japanese nationwide PCI (J-PCI) registry. We constructed generalized linear models to assess the difference in the daily number of patients and in-hospital outcomes between 2019 and 2020.
Findings
In total, 207 institutions (19·3%) had closed or restricted access during the first COVID-19 outbreak in May 2020; the number of closed or restricted institutions had plateaued at a median of 121 institutions (11·3%). The daily case volume of PCI significantly decreased in 2020 (by 6·7% compared with that in 2019; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6·2–7·2%; p < 0·001). Marked differences in the presentation of PCI patients were observed; more patients presented with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (18·3% vs. 17·5%; p < 0·001), acute heart failure (4·49% vs. 4·30%; p = 0·001), cardiogenic shock (3·79% vs. 3·45%; p < 0·001), and cardiopulmonary arrest (2·12% vs. 2·00%; p = 0·002) in 2020. The excess adjusted in-hospital mortality rate in patients treated in 2020 relative to those treated in 2019 was significant (adjusted odds ratio, 1·054; 95% CI, 1·004–1·107; p = 0·03).
Interpretation
While the number of patients who underwent PCI substantially decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, more patients presented with high-risk characteristics and were associated with significantly higher adjusted in-hospital mortality.
Funding
The J-PCI registry is a registry led and supported by the Japanese Association of Cardiovascular Intervention and Therapeutics. The present study was supported by the Grant-in-Aid from the Ministry of Health and Labour (No. 20IA2002 and 21FA1015), the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI; No. 21K08064), and the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (No. 17ek0210097h000).

AB  - Summary
Background
We aimed to evaluate the use of baricitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) 1–2 inhibitor, for the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.
Methods
This randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), is assessing multiple possible treatments in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone (usual care group) or usual care plus baricitinib 4 mg once daily by mouth for 10 days or until discharge if sooner (baricitinib group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed in the intention-to-treat population. A meta-analysis was done, which included the results from the RECOVERY trial and all previous randomised controlled trials of baricitinib or other JAK inhibitor in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. The RECOVERY trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04381936) and is ongoing.
Findings
Between Feb 2 and Dec 29, 2021, from 10 852 enrolled, 8156 patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus baricitinib versus usual care alone. At randomisation, 95% of patients were receiving corticosteroids and 23% were receiving tocilizumab (with planned use within the next 24 h recorded for a further 9%). Overall, 514 (12%) of 4148 patients allocated to baricitinib versus 546 (14%) of 4008 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (age-adjusted rate ratio 0·87; 95% CI 0·77–0·99; p=0·028). This 13% proportional reduction in mortality was somewhat smaller than that seen in a meta-analysis of eight previous trials of a JAK inhibitor (involving 3732 patients and 425 deaths), in which allocation to a JAK inhibitor was associated with a 43% proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0·57; 95% CI 0·45–0·72). Including the results from RECOVERY in an updated meta-analysis of all nine completed trials (involving 11 888 randomly assigned patients and 1485 deaths) allocation to baricitinib or another JAK inhibitor was associated with a 20% proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0·80; 95% CI 0·72–0·89; p<0·0001). In RECOVERY, there was no significant excess in death or infection due to non-COVID-19 causes and no significant excess of thrombosis, or other safety outcomes.
Interpretation
In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, baricitinib significantly reduced the risk of death but the size of benefit was somewhat smaller than that suggested by previous trials. The total randomised evidence to date suggests that JAK inhibitors (chiefly baricitinib) reduce mortality in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 by about one-fifth.

AB  - The latest WHO report determined the increasing diversity within the CoV-2 omicron and its descendent lineages. Some heavily mutated offshoots of BA.5 and BA.2, such as BA.4.6, BF.7, BQ.1.1, and BA.2.75, are responsible for about 20% of infections and are spreading rapidly in multiple countries. It is a sign that Omicron subvariants are now developing a capacity to be more immune escaping and may contribute to a new wave of COVID-19. Covid-19 infections often induce many alterations in human physiological defense and the natural control systems, with exacerbated activation of the inflammatory and homeostatic response, as for any infectious diseases. Severe activation of the early phase of hemostatic components, often occurs, leading to thrombotic complications and often contributing to a lethal outcome selectively in certain populations. Development of autoimmune complications increases the disease burden and lowers its prognosis. While the true mechanism still remains unclear, it is believed to mainly be related to the host autoimmune responses as demonstrated, only in some patients suffering from the presence of autoantibodies that worsens the disease evolution. In fact in some studies the development of autoantibodies to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified, and in other studies autoantibodies, thought to be targeting interferon or binding to annexin A1, or autoantibodies to phospholipids were seen. Moreover, the occurrence of autoimmune heparin induced thrombocytopenia has also been described in infected patients treated with heparin for controlling thrombogenicity. This commentary focuses on the presence of various autoantibodies reported so far in Covid-19 diseases, exploring their association with the disease course and the durability of some related symptoms. Attempts are also made to further analyze the potential mechanism of actions and link the presence of antibodies with pathological complications.

AB  - Disparities in screening mammography and barriers to accessing breast cancer screening are most prevalent among racial/ethnic minority and low-income women. The significant breast cancer mortality rates experienced in both Hispanic and African American populations are found to be connected to delayed screening. For these women to follow the screening guidelines outlined by the American College of Radiology and Society of Breast Imaging, they must successfully navigate existing barriers to screening. These barriers include differential access to care, language barriers, and lack of medical insurance. The COVID-19 Pandemic has worsened the barriers to breast cancer screening faced by these groups of women. These barriers need to be addressed or they may further exacerbate disparities.

Exploiting detailed geographical variation within countries, we show that a one-standard-deviation increase in social capital leads to between 14% and 34% fewer Covid-19 cases per capita accumulated from mid-March until end of June 2020, as well as between 6% and 35% fewer excess deaths per capita. Our results highlight the positive health returns of strengthening social capital.

AB  - Objective
Obesity is a major risk factor for adverse outcomes after COVID-19 infection. However, it is unknown if the worse outcomes are due to the confounding effect of demographic and obesity-related comorbidities. The study objective is to analyze associations between body mass index, patient characteristics, obesity-related comorbidity, and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
Methods
In this prospective cohort study, we chose patient records between March 1st, 2020, and December 1st, 2022, in a large tertiary care center in southeast Wisconsin in the United States. Patients over the age of 18 who tested positive were included in the study. Clinical outcomes included hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality rates. We examined the characteristics of patients who had positive clinical outcomes. We created unadjusted logistic regression models, sequentially adjusting for demographic and comorbidity variables, to assess the independent associations between BMI, patient characteristics, obesity-related comorbidities, and clinical outcomes.
Results
From a record of 1.67 million inpatients and outpatients at Froedtert Health Center, 55,299 (BMI: 30.5 ± 7.4 kg/m2, 62.5 % female) tested COVID-19 positive during the study period. 17,580 (31.8 %) patients were admitted to hospitals, and of hospitalized patients required ICU admission. 1038 (36.3 %) required mechanical ventilation, and 462 (44.5 %) died after a positive test for COVID-19. We found female patients show a higher hospitalization rate, while male patients have a higher rate of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Obesity-related comorbidities are associated with worse outcomes compared to simple obesity without comorbidities. In logistic regression models, we found four similar V-shaped associations between BMI and four clinical outcomes. Patients with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 are at the lowest risk for clinical outcomes. Patients with a BMI lower than 18 kg/m2 or higher than 30 kg/m2 are associated with a higher risk of hospitalization, ICU, mechanical ventilation, and death. After adjusting the model for demographic factors and hypertension and diabetes as two common comorbidities, we found that demographic factors do not significantly increase the risk. Obesity alone does not significantly increase the risk of severe clinical outcomes. Obesity-related comorbidities, on the other hand, resulted in a significantly higher risk of outcomes.
Conclusion
Obesity alone does not increase the risk of worse clinical outcomes after COVID-19 infection. It may suggest that the worse clinical outcomes of patients with obesity are mediated via hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Patients with obesity and comorbidities have a higher risk of poor outcomes. Obesity-related comorbidities, including hypertension and diabetes, are independently associated with poorer clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients. At a BMI of more than 30 kg/m2 or less than 18 kg/m2, we found an increase in the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes leading to hospitalization, ICU, mechanical ventilation, and death. The increased risk of severe outcomes is not attributed to patient characteristics but can be attributed to hypertension and diabetes.

AB  - Racial and ethnic-related health disparities in the United States have been intensified by the greater burden of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in racial and ethnic minority populations. Compared to non-Hispanic White individuals, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx individuals infected by COVID-19 are at greater risk for hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and death. There are several factors that may contribute to disparities in COVID-19-related severity and outcomes in these minority populations, including the greater burden of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases as discussed in our companion review article. Social determinants of health are a critical, yet often overlooked, contributor to racial and ethnic-related health disparities in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx individuals relative to non-Hispanic White individuals. Thus, the purpose of this review is to focus on the essential role of social factors in contributing to health disparities in chronic diseases and COVID-19 outcomes in minority populations. Herein, we begin by focusing on structural racism as a social determinant of health at the societal level that contributes to health disparities through downstream social level (e.g., occupation and residential conditions) and individual level health behaviors (e.g., nutrition, physical activity, and sleep). Lastly, we conclude with a discussion of practical applications and recommendations for future research and public health efforts that seek to reduce health disparities and overall disease burden.

AB  - Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been identified as one of the most common and significant problems in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, studies examining the relationship between COVID-19 and AKI in low- and low-middle income countries (LLMIC) are lacking. Given that AKI is known to carry a higher mortality rate in these countries, it is important to understand differences in this population.
Methods
This prospective, observational study examines the AKI incidence and characteristics of 32,210 patients with COVID-19 from 49 countries across all income levels who were admitted to an intensive care unit during their hospital stay.
Results
Among patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit, AKI incidence was highest in patients in LLMIC, followed by patients in upper-middle income countries (UMIC) and high-income countries (HIC) (53%, 38%, and 30%, respectively), whereas dialysis rates were lowest among patients with AKI from LLMIC and highest among those from HIC (27% vs. 45%). Patients with AKI in LLMIC had the largest proportion of community-acquired AKI (CA-AKI) and highest rate of in-hospital death (79% vs. 54% in HIC and 66% in UMIC). The association between AKI, being from LLMIC and in-hospital death persisted even after adjusting for disease severity.
Conclusions
AKI is a particularly devastating complication of COVID-19 among patients from poorer nations where the gaps in accessibility and quality of healthcare delivery have a major impact on patient outcomes.

AB  - Objectives
In situations of excess demand for healthcare, treating one patient means losing the opportunity to treat another. Therefore, each decision bears an opportunity cost. Nevertheless, when assessing the value of health technologies, these opportunity costs are not always fully considered. We present a pragmatic approach for conceptualizing vaccines’ health system capacity value when considering opportunity costs.
Methods
Our approach proxies opportunity costs through the net monetary benefit forgone as scarce healthcare resources are used to treat a vaccine-preventable disease instead of a patient from the waiting list. We apply this approach to cost the resource “hospital beds” for 3 different scenarios of excess demand. Empirically, we estimate the opportunity costs saved for 4 selected vaccination programs from the national schedule in England during a hypothetical scenario of long-lasting excess demand induced by the pandemic.
Results
The opportunity cost avoided through vaccination rises with excess demand for treatment. When treating an acute vaccine-preventable outcome is a suboptimal choice compared with treating elective patients, preventing a vaccine-preventable disease from blocking a hospital bed generates opportunity cost savings of approximately twice the direct costs saved by avoiding vaccine-preventable hospitalizations.
Conclusions
Policy makers should be aware that, in addition to preventing the outcome of interest, vaccines and other preventative health technologies deliver value in maintaining regular healthcare services and clearing the pent-up demand from the pandemic. Therefore, health system capacity value should be a key-value element in health technology assessment. Existing and potential future vaccination programs deliver more value than hitherto quantified.

AB  - Although not a standard-of-care yet, adoptive immunotherapeutic approaches have gradually earned a place within the list of antiviral therapies for some of fatal and hard-to-treat viral diseases. To maintain robust antiviral immunity and to effectively target the viral particles and virally-infected cells, immune cells capable of recognizing the viral antigens are required. While conventional vaccination can induce these cells in vivo; another option is to prime and generate antigen-specific immune cells ex vivo. This approach has been successfully trialed for virulent opportunistic viral infections after bone marrow transplantation. Amid the crisis of SARS-CoV2 pandemic, which has been followed by the success of certain early-authorized vaccines; some institutions and companies have explored the effects of viral-specific adoptive cell transfers (ACTs) in trials, as alternative treatments. Aimed at outlining a perspective on antigen-specific adoptive immunotherapy for viral infections, this review article specifically provides an appraisal of ACT-based studies/trials on SARS-CoV2 infection.

AB  - The number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases continues to surge, overwhelming healthcare systems and causing excess mortality in many countries. Testing of infectious populations remains a key strategy to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, delay the exponential spread of the disease, and flatten the epidemic curve. Using the Omicron variant outbreak as a background, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of testing strategies with different test combinations and frequencies, analyze the factors associated with testing effectiveness, and optimize testing strategies based on these influencing factors. We developed a stochastic, agent-based, discrete-time susceptible–latent–infectious–recovered model simulating a community to estimate the association between three levels of testing strategies and COVID-19 transmission. Antigen testing and its combination strategies were more efficient than polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-related strategies. Antigen testing also showed better performance in reducing the demand for hospital beds and intensive care unit beds. The delay in the turnaround time of test results had a more significant impact on the efficiency of the testing strategy compared to the detection limit of viral load and detection-related contacts. The main advantage of antigen testing strategies is the short turnaround time, which is also a critical factor to be optimized to improve PCR strategies. After modifying the turnaround time, the strategies with less frequent testing were comparable to daily testing. The choice of testing strategy requires consideration of containment goals, test efficacy, community prevalence, and economic factors. This study provides evidence for the selection and optimization of testing strategies in the post-pandemic era and provides guidance for optimizing healthcare resources.

AB  - Summary
Background
The burden of COVID-19 in children and adolescents has increased during the delta and omicron waves, necessitating studies of long-term symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnoea and cognitive problems. Furthermore, immune responses in relation to persisting symptoms in younger people have not been well characterised. In this cohort study, we investigated the role of antibodies, vaccination and omicron reinfection upon persisting and long-term symptoms up to 8 months post-delta infection.
Methods
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive participants (n = 276, aged 10–20 years) were prospectively recruited in August 2021. We recorded the major symptoms of post COVID-19 condition and collected serum samples 3- and 8-months post delta infection. Binding antibodies were measured by spike IgG ELISA, and surrogate neutralising antibodies against Wuhan and delta variants by the hemagglutination test (HAT).
Findings
After delta infection, persisting symptoms at 3 months were significantly associated with higher delta antibody titres (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.57–6.04, p = 0.001). Asymptomatic acute infection compared to symptomatic infection lowered the risk of persisting (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02–0.55, p = 0.013) and long-term (OR 0.28 95% CI 0.11–0.66, p = 0.005) symptoms at 3 and 8 months, respectively. Adolescents (16–20 years) were more likely to have long-term symptoms compared to children (10–15 years) (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.37–4.41, p = 0.003).
Interpretation
This clinical and serological study compares long-term symptoms after delta infection between children and adolescents. The association between high antibody titres and persisting symptoms suggest the involvement of an immune mechanism. Similarly to adults, the dominant long-term symptoms in children are fatigue, dyspnoea and cognitive problems.

AB  - Coronaviruses are pathogens thought to primarily affect the respiratory tracts of humans. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 was also marked mainly by its symptoms of respiratory illness, which were named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its initial discovery, many other symptoms have been linked to acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as to the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Among these symptoms are different categories of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which continue to be the main cause of death worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that 17.9 million people die from CVDs each year, accounting for ∼32% of all deaths globally. Physical inactivity is one of the most important behavioral risk factors for CVDs. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected CVDs as well as the physical activity in different ways. Here, we provide an overview of the current status as well as future challenges and possible solutions.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with specific coagulopathy that frequently occurs during the different phases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and can result in thrombotic complications and/or death. This COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) exhibits some of the features associated with thrombotic microangiopathy, particularly complement-mediated hemolytic-uremic syndrome. In some cases, due to the anti-phospholipid antibodies, CAC resembles catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome. In other patients, it exhibits features of hemophagocytic syndrome. CAC is mainly identified by: increases in fibrinogen, D-dimers, and von Willebrand factor (released from activated endothelial cells), consumption of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13 (ADAMTS13), over activated and dysregulated complement, and elevated plasma cytokine levels. CAC manifests as both major cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events and dysfunctional microcirculation, which leads to multiple organ damage. It is not clear whether the mainstay of COVID-19 is complement overactivation, cytokine/chemokine activation, or a combination of these activities. Available data have suggested that non-critically ill hospitalized patients should be administered full-dose heparin. In critically ill, full dose heparin treatment is discouraged due to higher mortality rate. In addition to anti-coagulation, four different host-directed therapeutic pathways have recently emerged that influence CAC: (1) Anti-von Willebrand factor monoclonal antibodies; (2) activated complement C5a inhibitors; (3) recombinant ADAMTS13; and (4) Interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 antibodies. Moreover, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the virus surface protein have been tested. However, the role of antiplatelet treatment remains unclear for patients with COVID-19.

AB  - We propose a new clustering approach for comparing financial time series and employ it to study how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the U.S. stock market. Essentially, we compute the forecast accuracy of asymmetric GARCH models applied to S&P500 industries and use the model forecast errors for different horizons and cut-off points to calculate a distance matrix for the stock indices. Hierarchical clustering algorithms are used to assign the set of industries into clusters. We found homogeneous clusters of industries in terms of the impact of COVID-19 on US stock market volatility. The industries most affected by the pandemic and with less accurate stock market prediction (Hotels, Airline, Apparel, Accessories & Luxury Goods, and Automobile) are separated in Euclidean distance from those industries that were less impacted by COVID-19 and which had more accurate forecasting (Pharmaceuticals, Internet & Direct Marketing Retail, Data Processing, and Movies & Entertainment).

AB  - Background
Mortality from COVID-19 shows a strong relationship with age and pre-existing medical conditions, as does mortality from other causes. We aimed to investigate how specific factors are differentially associated with COVID-19 mortality as compared to mortality from causes other than COVID-19.
Methods
Working on behalf of NHS England, we carried out a cohort study within the OpenSAFELY platform. Primary care data from England were linked to national death registrations. We included all adults (aged ≥18 years) in the database on 1st February 2020 and with >1 year of continuous prior registration; the cut-off date for deaths was 9th November 2020. Associations between individual-level characteristics and COVID-19 and non-COVID deaths, classified according to the presence of a COVID-19 code as the underlying cause of death on the death certificate, were estimated by fitting age- and sex-adjusted logistic models for these two outcomes.
Findings
17,456,515 individuals were included. 17,063 died from COVID-19 and 134,316 from other causes. Most factors associated with COVID-19 death were similarly associated with non-COVID death, but the magnitudes of association differed. Older age was more strongly associated with COVID-19 death than non-COVID death (e.g. ORs 40.7 [95% CI 37.7-43.8] and 29.6 [28.9-30.3] respectively for ≥80 vs 50-59 years), as was male sex, deprivation, obesity, and some comorbidities. Smoking, history of cancer and chronic liver disease had stronger associations with non-COVID than COVID-19 death. All non-white ethnic groups had higher odds than white of COVID-19 death (OR for Black: 2.20 [1.96-2.47], South Asian: 2.33 [2.16-2.52]), but lower odds than white of non-COVID death (Black: 0.88 [0.83-0.94], South Asian: 0.78 [0.75-0.81]).
Interpretation
Similar associations of most individual-level factors with COVID-19 and non-COVID death suggest that COVID-19 largely multiplies existing risks faced by patients, with some notable exceptions. Identifying the unique factors contributing to the excess COVID-19 mortality risk among non-white groups is a priority to inform efforts to reduce deaths from COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has strained health system capacity worldwide due to a surge of hospital admissions, while mitigation measures have simultaneously reduced patients' access to health care, affecting the diagnosis and treatment of other diseases such as cancer. We estimated the impact of delayed diagnosis on cancer outcomes in Chile using a novel modelling approach to inform policies and planning to mitigate the forthcoming cancer-related health impacts of the pandemic in Chile.
Methods
We developed a microsimulation model of five cancers in Chile (breast, cervix, colorectal, prostate, and stomach) for which reliable data were available, which simulates cancer incidence and progression in a nationally representative virtual population, as well as stage-specific cancer detection and survival probabilities. We calibrated the model to empirical data on monthly detected cases, as well as stage at diagnosis and 5-year net survival. We accounted for the impact of COVID-19 on excess mortality and cancer detection by month during the pandemic, and projected diagnosed cancer cases and outcomes of stage at diagnosis and survival up to 2030. For comparison, we simulated a no COVID-19 scenario in which the impacts of COVID-19 on excess mortality and cancer detection were removed.
Findings
Our modelling showed a sharp decrease in the number of diagnosed cancer cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a large projected short-term increase in future diagnosed cases. Due to the projected backlog in diagnosis, we estimated that in 2021 there will be an extra 3198 cases (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1356–5017) diagnosed among the five modelled cancers, an increase of nearly 14% compared with the no COVID-19 scenario, falling to a projected 10% increase in 2022 with 2674 extra cases (1318–4032) diagnosed. As a result of delayed diagnosis, we found a worse stage distribution for detected cancers in 2020–22, which is estimated to lead to 3542 excess cancer deaths (95% UI 2236–4816) in 2022–30, compared with the no COVID-19 scenario, among the five modelled cancers, most of which (3299 deaths, 2151–4431) are projected to occur before 2025.
Interpretation
In addition to a large projected surge in diagnosed cancer cases, we found that delays in diagnosis will result in worse cancer stage at presentation, leading to worse survival outcomes. These findings can help to inform surge capacity planning and highlight the importance of ensuring appropriate health system capacity levels to detect and care for the increased cancer cases in the coming years, while maintaining the timeliness and quality of cancer care. Potential delays in treatment and adverse impacts on quality of care, which were not considered in this model, are likely to contribute to even more excess deaths from cancer than projected.

AB  - COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading disease, which has caught the world by surprise. Millions of people suffer from illness, and the mortality rates are dramatically high. Currently, there is no specific and immediate treatment for this disease. Remedies are limited to supportive regiments and few antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs. The lack of a definite cure for COVID-19 is the reason behind its high mortality and global prevalence. COVID-19 can lead to a critical illness with severe respiratory distress and cytokine release. Increased oxidative stress and excessive production of inflammatory cytokines are vital components of severe COVID-19. Micronutrients, metalloids, and vitamins such as iron, manganese, selenium, Zinc, Copper, vitamin A, B family, and C are among the essential and trace elements that play a pivotal role in human nutrition and health. They participate in metabolic processes that lead to energy production. In addition, they support immune functions and act as antioxidants. Therefore, maintaining an optimal level of micronutrients intake, particularly those with antioxidant activities, is essential to fight against oxidative stress, modulate inflammation, and boost the immune system. Therefore, these factors could play a crucial role in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. In this review, we aimed to summarize antiviral properties of different vitamins and minerals. Moreover, we will investigate the correlation between them and their effects in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the development of reliable diagnostic methods for accurately detecting the novel coronavirus and its variants. Deep learning (DL) techniques have shown promising potential as screening tools for COVID-19 detection. In this study, we explore the realistic development of DL-driven COVID-19 detection methods and focus on the fully automatic framework using available resources, which can effectively investigate various coronavirus variants through modalities. We conducted an exploration and comparison of several diagnostic techniques that are widely used and globally validated for the detection of COVID-19. Furthermore, we explore review-based studies that provide detailed information on synergistic medicine combinations for the treatment of COVID-19. We recommend DL methods that effectively reduce time, cost, and complexity, providing valuable guidance for utilizing available synergistic combinations in clinical and research settings. This study also highlights the implication of innovative diagnostic technical and instrumental strategies, exploring public datasets, and investigating synergistic medicines using optimised DL rules. By summarizing these findings, we aim to assist future researchers in their endeavours by providing a comprehensive overview of the implication of DL techniques in COVID-19 detection and treatment. Integrating DL methods with various diagnostic approaches holds great promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of COVID-19 diagnostics, thus contributing to effective control and management of the ongoing pandemic.

In this paper, we first extend the SIR model by introducing two new status. We calibrate the model by 2022 Shanghai COVID-19 outbreak. The results shows compared to zero-constraint policy, under our control policy, 50 % more life can be saved at the cost of 2.13 % loss of consumptions. Our results also emphasize the importance of the dynamic nature and the timing of control policy, either a static pandemic control or a lagged pandemic control damages badly to people's livelihood and social productions. Counter factual experiments show that compared to the baseline, when a persistent high-strength control is applied, aggregate productions decreases by 57 %; when pandemic control ends too early, the death would rise by 15 %, when pandemic control starts too late, the death rises by 23 % and aggregate productions decreases by 13 %.

Summary of findings
Disease pandemics caused by emerging pathogens impacted the social development, health and wealth of most societies in human history. In an outbreak, the first months determine its course. To block an exponential spread and the development of an epi/ pandemic early, vaccine availability in sufficient quantities is of paramount importance. It is inevitable that new human viruses will emerge. Any future pandemic will come likely from RNA viruses through zoonotic or vector transmission, but we cannot predict when or where “Disease X” will strike. Public health, scientific and societal readiness plans need to include: continuous identification of new viruses in common mammalian reservoir hosts; continuous epidemiological surveillance, including wastewater sampling; establishment of prototype vaccine libraries against various virus families sharing functional and structural properties; testing of various and innovative vaccine platforms including mRNA, vector, nasal or oral vaccines for suitability by virus family; functional clinical trial sites and laboratory networks in various geographies; more efficient phasing of preclinical and clinical activities; global harmonization and streamlining of regulatory requirements including pre-established protocols; and societal preparedness including combating any pandemic of misinformation.
Conclusions
“Outbreaks are unavoidable, pandemics are optional”.

AB  - In an uncertain and finite world, actions towards the development of a green economy are attracting wider support. The damaging anthropogenic impact on earth systems is leading humanity to devastating situations, jeopardizing its very survival. A new world scenario has emerged with COVID-19, where the biopharmaceutical sector has arisen as a powerful effective solution for the health, economic and social crisis derived from the pandemic. This research aims to study the stock market reaction of the two US biopharmaceutical companies that first developed messenger RNA vaccines against COVID-19 (Pfizer and Moderna), considering two time periods, before and during COVID. In the analysis, the influence of the technological market index, market volatility, and investor sentiment are also considered. The results show an unequal influence of market volatility and market sentiment on the returns of both companies, as well as a different volatility behaviour. Furthermore, a contagion effect is observed during the COVID period between both companies and the technological market. The study's findings provide investors, organizations, policy-makers and society with useful information for the design of policies and strategies that ultimately are called to ensure sustainable growth for future generations.

During the pandemic, the antimicrobial aprons, face masks, sterilizers, sensor processed touch-free sanitizers, and highly effective diagnostic devices having greater sensitivity and selectivity helped to foster the healthcare facilities. Furthermore, the research and development sectors are tackling this emergency with the rapid invention of vaccines and medicines. In this regard, two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are greatly explored to combat the extreme severity of the pandemic. Among the nanomaterials, the 2D MXene is a prospective element due to its unique properties like greater surface functionalities, enhanced conductivity, superior hydrophilicity, and excellent photocatalytic and/or photothermal properties. These unique properties of MXene can be utilized to fabricate face masks, PPE kits, face shields, and biomedical instruments like efficient biosensors having greater antiviral activities. MXenes can also cure comorbidities in COVID-19 patients and have high drug loading as well as controlled drug release capacity. Moreover, the remarkable biocompatibility of MXene adds a feather in its cap for diverse biomedical applications. This review briefly explains the different synthesis processes of 2D MXenes, their biocompatibility, cytotoxicity and antiviral features. In addition, this review also discusses the viral cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and its inactivation mechanism using MXene. Finally, various applications of MXene for combatting the COVID-19 pandemic and their future perspectives are discussed.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic provides a stark reminder of the political tensions associated with the field of immigration and health, highlighting the central role that nationalism, racism and xenophobia play in determining responses to communicable diseases. The blurring of global health, immigration governance, and the global health security agendas has long been recognised. However, an improved understanding of the politics influencing these entanglements, specifically within the context of the Covid-19 response in low- and middle-income country contexts, is urgently needed. This includes – but is not limited to – the immediate concerns surrounding inclusive social, political and medical responses to Covid-19; vaccine nationalism – at both global and national levels; and calls for ‘vaccine passports’. To this end, we draw on the Southern African Development Community (SADC) context – one associated with high levels of diverse population movements and a large burden of communicable diseases – to explore responses to Covid-19. We unpack tensions surrounding the management of migration and the ways in which sovereignty impacts attempts at building regional, coordinated responses to migration and health, and consider how this affects progress towards global health targets. With an initial focus on South Africa, we build on previous work exploring the blurring of global health, immigration governance, and the global health security agendas in SADC, and draw from ongoing research on the governance of migration and health within the region. This includes current and evolving research exploring migration and Covid-19, initiated in March 2020 when the first cases of Covid-19 were identified in Southern Africa. The aim is for these findings to catalyse a new and evolving researh agenda to inform the development and implementation of appropriate pandemic responses in a region associated with some of the highest levels of inequality globally. To this end, an evolving research agenda should be responsive to current needs. We suggest that, in SADC, priority research should focus on improving our understanding of (1) the political factors influencing the (dis)connections between migration and health governance structures in the context of Covid-19, and how to overcome these in the context of a pandemic; and (2) the motivations for and implications of a ‘vaccine passport’ system on movement within and beyond the SADC region. This requires a reactive, cross-disciplinary, regional research network. In a context where funding for research is increasingly inaccessible, this requires innovative, informal, collaborative engagement.

AB  - Rapid screening, detection and monitoring of viral infection is of critical importance, as exemplified by the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, leading to the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19. This is equally the case for the stages of patient convalescence as for the initial stages of infection, to understand the medium and long terms effects, as well as the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Optical spectroscopic techniques potentially offer an alternative to currently employed techniques of screening for the presence, or the response to infection. In this study, the ability of Raman spectroscopy to distinguish between samples of the serum of convalescent COVID-19 positive patients and COVID-19 negative serum samples, and to further analyse and quantify systemic responses, was explored. The study included serum samples of patients who had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM responses between 25 and 134 days after the infection was identified. Both COVID-19 positive and negative groups included males and females who ranged in age from 21 to 81 years old. No correlation was apparent between the specified SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM immunoglobulin levels of the positive group, their sex, or age. Raman spectroscopic measurements were performed at 785 nm, in liquid serum, thawed from frozen, and spectra were pre-processed to remove the contribution of water, normalising to the water content. Principal components analysis of the spectral dataset over the range 400–1800 cm-1 provided no clear indication of a difference between normal serum and SARS-CoV-2 positive serum. A selection of 5 of the samples, which were available in sufficient volume, were fractionated by centrifugal filtration, and the 100 kDa, 50 kDa, 30 kDa, and 10 kDa concentrates similarly analysed by Raman spectroscopy. Partial least squares regression analysis revealed a negative correlation between the spectral profile of the 30 kDa fractions and SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody levels, potentially indicating an association with depleted glutathione levels. The study supports a potential role of Raman screening of blood serum for monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also in longitudinal studies of disease progression, long term effects, and therapeutic interventions.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected >610 million people globally, exerting major social, economic, and health impacts. Despite the large number of global casualities and severe symptomatology associated with COVID-19, a large number of individuals remain at elevated risk of infection and severe outcomes related to poor lifestyle behaviors and/or associated comorbidities. Beyond the well-known social distance and masking policies, maintaining an active lifestyle, minimizing the consumption of tobacco products, and maintaining an adequate nutrition status are some of the key factors that, in an affordable and accessible way, have the potential to improve health and minimize COVID-19 impact. In addition, bringing awareness of the higher risks and poor prognosis of COVID-19 when other conditions are present seems to be essential to protect those individuals with the highest risks.

AB  - Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the neoplasms with higher mortality, causing around 700 000 deaths worldwide. Despite efforts in GC research, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and conventional surgery have not been sufficiently effective. Immunotherapy has been proposed as an alternative, and the most recent guidelines recommend its use as a third-line treatment for advanced GC. In this context, the development of an mRNA vaccine to control GC is presented as a promising alternative, either to stimulate an immune response against tumor cells or as a therapeutic option to restore the immune system and reduce mortality from GC. Although there is still a long way to go, technological advances and ongoing research bring us closer to the development of an mRNA vaccine for GC that can be administered in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Resumen
El cáncer gástrico (CG) es una de las neoplasias con mayor mortalidad, provocando alrededor de 700.000 muertes en todo el mundo. A pesar de los esfuerzos en la investigación de GC, la quimioterapia, la radioterapia y la cirugía convencional no han sido lo suficientemente efectivas. La inmunoterapia se ha propuesto como opción y las guías más recientes recomiendan su uso como tratamiento de tercera línea para el CG avanzado. En este contexto, el desarrollo de una vacuna de ARNm para el control de CG se presenta como una alternativa prometedora, ya sea para estimular una respuesta inmune contra las células tumorales o como una opción terapéutica para restaurar el sistema inmunológico y reducir la mortalidad por CG. Aunque todavía queda mucho camino por recorrer, los avances tecnológicos y la investigación en curso nos acercan al desarrollo de una vacuna de ARNm para CG que pueda administrarse en combinación con inhibidores de puntos de control inmunitarios.

AB  - Aim
COVID-19 is an inflammatory disease and its prognosis is associated with cardiovascular risk, which can be associated with changes in lipoprotein metabolism. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs187238 of Interleukin (IL)-18 is extensively reported in association with worsening inflammatory and cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study evaluated the association of IL-18 levels and its SNP rs187238 with lipoprotein profile changes in COVID-19 outpatients.
Methods
Observational, analytical, cross-sectional study that evaluated 250 patients with respiratory syndrome, 36% (n = 90) with COVID-19. Serum total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), triglycerides (TG), apolipoproteins A-I and B (Apo A-I and Apo B) and IL-18 levels were determined. Polymorphism genotyping was done by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The significance level was p < 0.05.
Results
Patients with COVID-19 showed a reduction in TC and HDL-c, without difference in IL-18. HDL-c and LDL-c had a high frequency outside the reference values. There was a negative correlation of IL-18 with HDL-c and a positive correlation with Apo B/Apo A-I ratio. The frequencies of the C (wild) and G (polymorphic) alleles between patients with and without COVID-19 followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. However, COVID-19 was associated with reduced HDL-c and Apo A-I values in patients with the CC genotype.
Conclusion
IL-18 levels and its SNP rs187238 were associated with decreased HDL-c and Apo A-I in COVID-19 outpatients.

AB  - The ongoing coronavirus pandemic responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly increased the rate of global death and infections due to variant mutations (such as Delta and Omicron). While specifically developed and approved vaccines can limit the spread of disease in a population and severity of resulting symptoms, none have been demonstrated to effectively prevent infection altogether. Thus, reliable early diagnosis of COVID-19 is critical to identify positive cases to help contain the outbreak. Herein we report a label-free electrochemical immunosensor for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 by using nitrogen-doped holey graphene (N-HRGO) as a nanocarrier decorated with thionine (TH) molecules as electrochemical indicators. With the spike protein located on the surface of the COVID-19 particles as the model target, the as-prepared electrochemical immunosensor could detect the presence of the COVID-19 spike protein over a wide linear range (1 pg mL−1−10 ng mL−1) with a low detection limit (0.3 pg mL−1). In addition, the developed electrochemical immunosensor exhibited an excellent selectivity (with insignificant current changes towards interfering proteins comparing with COVID-19 spike protein), a good reproducibility and long-term storage stability. Importantly, the electrochemical immunosensor thus developed could successfully and reliably detect the spike protein of COVID-19 in saliva and human serum complex samples. Thus, the as-prepared label-free electrochemical immunosensor can achieve rapid and sensitive detection of the COVID-19 spike protein, as a promising clinical diagnosis tool in monitoring the progression of COVID-19.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global crisis, and medical systems in many countries are overwhelmed with supply shortages and increasing demands to treat patients due to the surge in cases and severe illnesses. This study aimed to assess COVID-19-related essential clinical resource demands in China, based on different scenarios involving COVID-19 spreads and interventions. We used a susceptible–exposed–infectious–hospitalized/isolated–removed (SEIHR) transmission dynamics model to estimate the number of COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations with corresponding essential healthcare resources needed. We found that, under strict non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) or mass vaccination of the population, China would be able to contain community transmission and local outbreaks rapidly. However, under scenarios involving a low intensity of implemented NPIs and a small proportion of the population vaccinated, the use of a peacetime–wartime transition model would be needed for medical source stockpiles and preparations to ensure a normal functioning healthcare system. The implementation of COVID-19 vaccines and NPIs in different periods can influence the transmission of COVID-19 and subsequently affect the demand for clinical diagnosis and treatment. An increased proportion of asymptomatic infections in simulations will not reduce the demand for medical resources; however, attention must be paid to the increasing difficulty in containing COVID-19 transmission due to asymptomatic cases. This study provides evidence for emergency preparations and the adjustment of prevention and control strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also provides guidance for essential healthcare investment and resource allocation.

AB  - Summary
Background
Communicable disease control has long been a focus of global health policy. There have been substantial reductions in the burden and mortality of communicable diseases among children younger than 5 years, but we know less about this burden in older children and adolescents, and it is unclear whether current programmes and policies remain aligned with targets for intervention. This knowledge is especially important for policy and programmes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to use the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019 to systematically characterise the burden of communicable diseases across childhood and adolescence.
Methods
In this systematic analysis of the GBD study from 1990 to 2019, all communicable diseases and their manifestations as modelled within GBD 2019 were included, categorised as 16 subgroups of common diseases or presentations. Data were reported for absolute count, prevalence, and incidence across measures of cause-specific mortality (deaths and years of life lost), disability (years lived with disability [YLDs]), and disease burden (disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs]) for children and adolescents aged 0–24 years. Data were reported across the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and across time (1990–2019), and for 204 countries and territories. For HIV, we reported the mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) as a measure of health system performance.
Findings
In 2019, there were 3·0 million deaths and 30·0 million years of healthy life lost to disability (as measured by YLDs), corresponding to 288·4 million DALYs from communicable diseases among children and adolescents globally (57·3% of total communicable disease burden across all ages). Over time, there has been a shift in communicable disease burden from young children to older children and adolescents (largely driven by the considerable reductions in children younger than 5 years and slower progress elsewhere), although children younger than 5 years still accounted for most of the communicable disease burden in 2019. Disease burden and mortality were predominantly in low-SDI settings, with high and high-middle SDI settings also having an appreciable burden of communicable disease morbidity (4·0 million YLDs in 2019 alone). Three cause groups (enteric infections, lower-respiratory-tract infections, and malaria) accounted for 59·8% of the global communicable disease burden in children and adolescents, with tuberculosis and HIV both emerging as important causes during adolescence. HIV was the only cause for which disease burden increased over time, particularly in children and adolescents older than 5 years, and especially in females. Excess MIRs for HIV were observed for males aged 15–19 years in low-SDI settings.
Interpretation
Our analysis supports continued policy focus on enteric infections and lower-respiratory-tract infections, with orientation to children younger than 5 years in settings of low socioeconomic development. However, efforts should also be targeted to other conditions, particularly HIV, given its increased burden in older children and adolescents. Older children and adolescents also experience a large burden of communicable disease, further highlighting the need for efforts to extend beyond the first 5 years of life. Our analysis also identified substantial morbidity caused by communicable diseases affecting child and adolescent health across the world.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic increased stress and reduced wellness for patients and physicians alike. The uncertainty, frequent changes, fear of illness and death, and supply chain issues taxed an already broken health care system. The pandemic undermined the factors that allow for a healthy workplace: control, predictability, and certainty. During this time, rates of depression, suicidality, and anxiety all increased among physicians and the community at large. These challenges were aggravated by disagreements regarding masking and vaccinations. These factors, as well as the degree to which people felt valued or not also contributed to burnout. Some changes such as the transition to telemedicine, although initially stressful, led to patient satisfaction and allowed clinical care to continue. Other changes, such as trying to homeschool, or watching young children while also trying to work were less desirable. Patients and physicians did their best to combat isolation, fear, anxiety, and the numerous societal changes. Burnout fluctuated throughout the pandemic related to local and systemic factors such as rates of infection, vaccination, supply chain issues, and individual support. The pandemic highlighted problems with our health care system, including structural racism, health care disparities, and how easily the system can be overwhelmed. Physicians may have been thrown into roles they did not feel comfortable filling and may have had insufficient staff to practice in the way they wanted. These factors led to frustration among patients and physicians alike. The National Plan for Health Workforce Well-Being outlines the need for health care reform to allow for effective and safe health care while protecting clinicians from burnout.

AB  - Summary
Several global efforts are underway to develop COVID-19 vaccines, and interim analyses from phase 3 clinical testing have been announced by nine organisations: Pfizer, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm Group, Sinovac Biotech, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, and CanSino Biologics. The US programme known as Operation Warp Speed provided US$18 billion in funding for development of vaccines that were intended for US populations. Depending on safety and efficacy, vaccines can become available through mechanisms for emergency use, expanded access with informed consent, or full licensure. An important question is: how will these Operation Warp Speed vaccines be used for COVID-19 prevention in global health settings? We address some key questions that arise in the transition from US to global vaccine prevention efforts and from ethical and logistical issues to those that are relevant to global vaccine security, justice, equity, and diplomacy.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 is known to be associated with a myriad of cardiovascular (CV) complications during acute illness, but the rates of readmissions for CV complications after COVID-19 infection are less well established.
Methods
The US Nationwide Readmission Database was utilized to identify COVID-19 admissions that occurred in the period from April 1st to November 30th, 2020, using International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, Clinical Modification administrative claims.
Results
A total of 521,351 admissions for COVID-19 were identified. The all-cause 30-day readmission rate was 11.6% (n = 60,262). The incidence of CV-related readmissions was 5.1% (n = 26,725), accounting for 44.3% of all-cause 30-day readmissions. Both CV-related and non-CV-related readmissions occurred at a median of 7 days. Patients readmitted with CV causes had a higher comorbidity burden, with a median Charlson comorbidity score of 6. The most common CV cause of readmission was acute heart failure (8.5%), followed by acute myocardial infarction (5.2%). Venous thromboembolism and stroke during 30-day readmission occurred at rates of 4.6% and 3.6%, respectively. Stress cardiomyopathy and acute myocarditis were less frequent, with incidences of 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. CV-related readmissions were associated with higher mortality, compared with non-CV-related readmissions (16.5% vs 7.5%, P < 0.01). Each 30-day CV-related readmission was associated with greater cost of care than each non-CV-related readmission ($13,803 vs $10,310, P < 0.01).
Conclusions
Among survivors of index COVID-19 admission, 44.7% of all 30-day readmissions were attributed to CV causes. Acute heart failure remains the most common cause of readmission after COVID-19, followed closely by acute myocardial infarction. CV causes of readmissions remain a significant source of mortality, morbidity, and resource utilization.
Résumé
Contexte
La COVID-19 est connue pour être associée à une myriade de complications cardiovasculaires (CV) durant la maladie en phase aiguë, mais les taux de nouvelles hospitalisations pour des complications CV après une infection par le virus causant la COVID-19 sont moins bien établis.
Méthodologie
La Nationwide Readmission Database des États-Unis a servi à recenser les hospitalisations pour la COVID-19 dans la période allant du 1er avril au 30 novembre 2020, à l’aide de la Classification internationale des maladies, 10e révision, modifications cliniques, selon les données administratives sur les demandes de remboursement.
Résultats
Au total, 521 351 hospitalisations pour la COVID-19 ont été recensées. Le taux de nouvelle hospitalisation à 30 jours, toutes causes confondues, a été de 11,6 % (n = 60 262). La fréquence de nouvelles hospitalisations liées à des causes CV a été de 5,1 % (n = 26 725), ce qui représente 44,3 % des nouvelles hospitalisations à 30 jours, toutes causes confondues. Les nouvelles hospitalisations, liées ou non liées à des causes CV, se sont produites à une médiane de sept jours. Les patients réadmis à l’hôpital pour des causes CV avaient un plus lourd fardeau de comorbidité, la valeur médiane du score de comorbidité de Charlson étant de 6. La cause CV la plus fréquente de nouvelle hospitalisation a été une insuffisance cardiaque aiguë (8,5 %), suivie d’un infarctus aigu du myocarde (5,2 %). Une thromboembolie veineuse et un accident vasculaire cérébral sont survenus durant une nouvelle hospitalisation dans les 30 jours à des taux de 4,6 % et de 3,6 %, respectivement. Une cardiomyopathie de stress et une myocardite aiguë ont été signalées à des fréquences moindres de 0,1 % et de 0,2 %, respectivement. Les nouvelles hospitalisations pour des causes CV ont été associées à une mortalité accrue comparativement aux nouvelles hospitalisations pour des causes autres que CV (16,5 % contre 7,5 %; p < 0,01). Les coûts des soins de santé associés à chaque nouvelle hospitalisation liée à une cause CV à 30 jours ont été plus élevés que pour chaque nouvelle hospitalisation non liée à une cause CV (13 803 $ contre 10 310 $; p < 0,01).
Conclusions
Chez les survivants de la première hospitalisation pour la COVID-19, 44,7 % des nouvelles hospitalisations à 30 jours ont été attribuées à des causes CV. Une insuffisance cardiaque aiguë demeure la principale cause de nouvelle hospitalisation après la COVID-19, suivie de près par un infarctus aigu du myocarde. Les causes CV des nouvelles hospitalisations sont encore une importante source de mortalité, de morbidité et d’utilisation des ressources.

AB  - COVID-19 has exposed major weaknesses in the healthcare settings. The surge in COVID-19 cases increases the demands of health care, endangers vulnerable patients, and threats occupational safety. In contrast to a hospital outbreak of SARS leading to a whole hospital quarantined, at least 54 hospital outbreaks following a COVID-19 surge in the community were controlled by strengthened infection prevention and control measures for preventing transmission from community to hospitals as well as within hospitals. Access control measures include establishing triage, epidemic clinics, and outdoor quarantine stations. Visitor access restriction is applied to inpatients to limit the number of visitors. Health monitoring and surveillance is applied to healthcare personnel, including self-reporting travel declaration, temperature, predefined symptoms, and test results. Isolation of the confirmed cases during the contagious period and quarantine of the close contacts during the incubation period are critical for containment. The target populations and frequency of SARS-CoV-2 PCR and rapid antigen testing depend on the level of transmission. Case investigation and contact tracing should be comprehensive to identify the close contacts to prevent further transmission. These facility-based infection prevention and control strategies help reduce hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to a minimum in Taiwan.

AB  - Selenium is an indispensable trace element for all living organisms. It is an essential structural component of several selenium-dependent enzymes, which support the human body’s defense mechanism. Recently, the significance of selenium in preventing/treating COVID-19 has been documented in the literature. This review highlights the clinical studies, compositions, and patent literature on selenium to prevent/treat COVID-19. Selenium exerts its anti-COVID-19 action by reducing oxidative stress, declining the expression of the ACE-2 receptor, lowering the discharge of pro-inflammatory substances, and inhibiting the 3CLPro (main protease) and PLpro enzyme of SARS-CoV-2. The data of clinical studies, inventive compositions, and patent literature revealed that selenium monotherapy and its compositions with other nutritional supplements/drugs (vitamin, iron, zinc, copper, ferulic acid, resveratrol, spirulina, N-acetylcysteine, fish oil, many herbs, doxycycline, azithromycin, curcumin, quercetin, etc.,) might be practical to prevent/treat COVID-19. The studies have also suggested a correlation between COVID-19 and selenium deficiency. This indicates that adequate selenium supplementation may provide promising treatment outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The authors foresee the development and commercialization of Selenium-based compositions and dosage forms (spray, inhalers, control release dosage forms, etc.) to battle COVID-19. We also trust that numerous selenium-based compositions are yet to be explored. Accordingly, there is good scope for scientists to work on developing novel and inventive selenium-based compositions to fight against COVID-19. However, there is also a need to consider the narrow therapeutic window and chemical interaction of selenium before developing selenium-based compositions.

AB  - Summary
Background
While the COVID-19 pandemic will increase mortality due to the virus, it is also likely to increase mortality indirectly. In this study, we estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths resulting from the potential disruption of health systems and decreased access to food.
Methods
We modelled three scenarios in which the coverage of essential maternal and child health interventions is reduced by 9·8–51·9% and the prevalence of wasting is increased by 10–50%. Although our scenarios are hypothetical, we sought to reflect real-world possibilities, given emerging reports of the supply-side and demand-side effects of the pandemic. We used the Lives Saved Tool to estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths under each scenario, in 118 low-income and middle-income countries. We estimated additional deaths for a single month and extrapolated for 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.
Findings
Our least severe scenario (coverage reductions of 9·8–18·5% and wasting increase of 10%) over 6 months would result in 253 500 additional child deaths and 12 200 additional maternal deaths. Our most severe scenario (coverage reductions of 39·3–51·9% and wasting increase of 50%) over 6 months would result in 1 157 000 additional child deaths and 56 700 additional maternal deaths. These additional deaths would represent an increase of 9·8–44·7% in under-5 child deaths per month, and an 8·3–38·6% increase in maternal deaths per month, across the 118 countries. Across our three scenarios, the reduced coverage of four childbirth interventions (parenteral administration of uterotonics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants, and clean birth environments) would account for approximately 60% of additional maternal deaths. The increase in wasting prevalence would account for 18–23% of additional child deaths and reduced coverage of antibiotics for pneumonia and neonatal sepsis and of oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea would together account for around 41% of additional child deaths.
Interpretation
Our estimates are based on tentative assumptions and represent a wide range of outcomes. Nonetheless, they show that, if routine health care is disrupted and access to food is decreased (as a result of unavoidable shocks, health system collapse, or intentional choices made in responding to the pandemic), the increase in child and maternal deaths will be devastating. We hope these numbers add context as policy makers establish guidelines and allocate resources in the days and months to come.

AB  - Worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare services, including cervical cancer management, and an increased burden for this condition is expected. This systematic review synthetizes the available evidence on the impact of the pandemic on prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer. Searches were performed on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for relevant studies on these topics with the purpose of comparing service access and care delivery before and during COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the methodological heterogeneity among the studies, findings were narratively discussed. Of the 715 screened titles and abstracts, 33 articles were included, corresponding to 42 reports that covered the outcomes of interest: vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) (6 reports), cancer screening (19), diagnosis (8), and treatment (8). Seven studies observed reductions in HPV vaccination uptake and coverage during COVID-19. Reports on cervical screening and cancer diagnosis activities showed a substantial impact of the pandemic on access to screening services and diagnostic procedures. All but one study that investigated cervical cancer treatment reported changes in the number of women with cervical lesions who received treatments, as well as treatment delay and interruption. With a major impact during the first wave in 2020, COVID-19 and restriction measures resulted in a substantial disruption in cervical cancer prevention and management, with declines in screening and delays in treatment. Taken together, findings from this systematic review calls for urgent policy interventions for recovering cervical cancer prevention and care.

KW  - Noninfectious uveitis
AB  - Purpose
To assess the association between BNT162b2 mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine and the risk of active noninfectious uveitis (NIU).
Design
Retrospective, population-based study.
Participants
Two million six hundred two thousand five hundred fifty-seven people who received the first vaccine dose between December 20, 2020, and April 30, 2021, and 2 441 719 people who received the second vaccine dose between January 10, 2021, and April 30, 2021.
Methods
Events of active NIU were included if they occurred within 21 days after either vaccine dose. Active NIU was defined as newly active or worsening ocular inflammation requiring initiation or increase in local or systemic corticosteroids. Observed cases were compared with the expected number, based on the experience of the population in 2019.
Main Outcome Measures
Age- and sex-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and attributable risks after BNT126b2 vaccination.
Results
Overall, 100 and 88 events of active NIU were recorded within 21 days after the first and second vaccine doses, respectively. Using the experience of the population in 2019 as a reference, after the first dose, the estimated age- and sex-adjusted SIR was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15–1.71) along with a 21-day attributable risk of 1.12 cases per 100 000 vaccinees. After the second dose, the SIR was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.05–1.62), with an estimated attributable risk of 0.86 cases per 100 000 vaccinees. Anterior uveitis was the most common site of inflammation, occurring in 90.96% of eyes, and idiopathic uveitis was the most common cause (56.38%).
Conclusions
This study suggests that the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may be associated with an increased risk of active NIU. However, considering the small effect size and study limitations, this study does not provide proof for a cause-and-effect relationship. The small estimated attributable risks suggest that the impact on public health is relatively minor.

AB  - There has been an increase in the outbreak of communicable diseases in recent times; the most recent ones are Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) and COVID-19. These diseases have had different impacts on society and the ecosystem. However, underlying these impacts are the levels of preparedness of governments and public health institutions to mitigate and control these diseases. Therefore, this paper aims to explore these impacts, government and institutional interventions and their nexus towards the effective management of such crises. A critical review of empirical literature was adopted for the methodological approach and narrative synthesis used for analysis. Results show that EVD had diverse impacts on West Africa; economically through the loss of income from economic activities due to widespread sickness among workers and movement restrictions. EVD also had significant social impacts, such as reduced community cohesion, school and business closures, job losses, food insecurity, and high morbidity and mortality. Though some good efforts have been made by different countries in collaboration with international organisations like the World Health Organization to control disease outbreaks more effectively, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has however exposed major weaknesses in the capacity of most African countries to cope. Poor capacity for testing and treatment, inadequate health facilities, poor incentives for health care workers, poor governance systems, poor border control, and awareness and research capacities impacted negatively on the capacity to control disease outbreaks. There is, therefore, a need to strengthen health systems across Africa through improved resource mobilisation, staff training, and coordination of investment strategies to sustain health system preparedness to manage future emerging or re-emerging outbreaks.

AB  - Causal machine learning (ML) algorithms recover graphical structures that tell us something about cause-and-effect relationships. The causal representation provided by these algorithms enables transparency and explainability, which is necessary for decision making in critical real-world problems. Yet, causal ML has had limited impact in practice compared to associational ML. This paper investigates the challenges of causal ML with application to COVID-19 UK pandemic data. We collate data from various public sources and investigate what the various structure learning algorithms learn from these data. We explore the impact of different data formats on algorithms spanning different classes of learning, and assess the results produced by each algorithm, and groups of algorithms, in terms of graphical structure, model dimensionality, sensitivity analysis, confounding variables, predictive and interventional inference. We use these results to highlight open problems in causal structure learning and directions for future research. To facilitate future work, we make all graphs, models, data sets, and source code publicly available online.

AB  - Background
The number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases was expected to increase during the Tokyo Olympic Games because of the increased physical contact within and between the domestic population and international participants of the Games. The rapid rise of the Delta variant (B.1.617) in Japan meant that hosting the Olympic Games without any restrictions was likely to lead to an increase in cases. We aimed to quantitatively assess possible COVID-19 response strategies for the Olympic Games, comparing the prevalence of severe cases and the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths via scenario analysis.
Methods
We used a discrete-time deterministic compartmental model structured by age group. Parameters were calibrated using the age-stratified COVID-19 incidence data in Osaka. Numerical simulations incorporated the planned Olympics Games and nationwide COVID-19 vaccination into the proposed model, alongside various subjects and types of countermeasures.
Results
Our model-informed approach suggested that having spectators at the Tokyo Olympic Games could lead to a surge in both cases and hospitalization. Projections for the scenario that explicitly incorporated the spread of the Delta variant (i.e., time-dependent increase in the relative transmissibility) showed that imposing stringent social distancing measures (Rt=0.7) for more than 8 weeks from the end of the Olympic Games might be required to suppress the prevalence of severe cases of COVID-19 to avoid overwhelming the intensive care unit capacity in Tokyo.
Conclusions
Our modeling analyses guided an optimal choice of COVID-19 response during and after the Tokyo Olympic Games, allowing the epidemic to be brought under control despite such a large mass gathering.

AB  - The aim of this article is to give a better understanding of the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the Bergamo province (Italy), one of the most hit areas of the world, between February and April 2020. A new compartmental model, called SIAT3HE, was designed and fitted on accurate data about the pandemic provided by ATS Bergamo, the health protection agency of the Bergamo province. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 reached Bergamo in January and infected 318,000 people, the 28.8% of the province population. The 43.1% of the infected individuals stayed asymptomatic. As 6,028 people died due to COVID-19 till April 30th, the infection fatality ratio of SARS-CoV-2 in the Bergamo province was 1.9%. These results are in very good agreement with available information: the number of infections is consistent with the results of recent serological surveys and the number of deaths due to COVID-19 is close to the excess mortality of the considered period.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infection and its clinical manifestations (COVID-19) quickly evolved to a pandemic and a global public health emergency. The limited effectivity of available treatments aimed at reducing virus replication and the lessons learned from other coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV-1 or NL63) that share the internalization process of SARS-CoV-2, led us to revisit the COVID-19 pathogenesis and potential treatments. Virus protein S binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) initiating the internalization process. Endosome formation removes ACE2 from the cellular membrane preventing its counter-regulative effect mediated by the metabolism of angiotensin II to angiotensin (1–7). Internalized virus-ACE2 complexes have been identified for these coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 presents the highest affinity for ACE2 and produces the most severe symptoms. Assuming ACE2 internalization is the trigger for COVID-19 pathogenesis, accumulation of angiotensin II can be viewed as the potential cause of symptoms. Angiotensin II is a strong vasoconstrictor, but has also important roles in hypertrophy, inflammation, remodeling, and apoptosis. Higher levels of ACE2 in the lungs explain the acute respiratory distress syndrome as primary symptoms. Most of the described findings and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including increased interleukin levels, endothelial inflammation, hypercoagulability, myocarditis, dysgeusia, inflammatory neuropathies, epileptic seizures and memory disorders can be explained by excessive angiotensin II levels. Several meta-analyses have demonstrated that previous use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers were associated with better prognosis for COVID-19. Therefore, pragmatic trials to assess the potential therapeutic benefits of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors should be urgently promoted by health authorities to widen the therapeutic options for COVID-19.
Resumo
A infeção por SARS-CoV-2 e as suas manifestações clínicas (COVID-19) evoluíram rapidamente para uma pandemia e um problema de saúde pública global. A efetividade limitada dos tratamentos existentes orientados apenas para a redução da replicação do vírus e as lições aprendidas com outros coronavírus que utilizam o mesmo recetor de internalização levaram-nos a revisitar a patogénese da Covid-19 e potenciais tratamentos. A proteína S do vírus liga-se à enzima conversora de angiotensina de tipo 2 (ECA2) iniciando o processo de internalização. A afinidade do SARS-CoV-2 para a ECA2 é superior à dos outros coronavirus, o que se correlaciona com a gravidade dos sintomas. A ECA2 acompanha o vírus no endossoma, tendo sido identificados complexos vírus-ECA2 internalizados dos três coronavírus referidos. A ausência da ECA2 na membrana celular compromete o metabolismo da angiotensina II em angiotensina (1-7), pelo que a acumulação de angiotensina II pode ser vista como a causa potencial dos sintomas. A angiotensina II é um potente vasoconstritor mas também desempenha papéis importantes em processos fisiopatológicos como a inflamação, fibrose, hipertrofia e apoptose. Níveis mais elevados de angiotensina II nos pulmões explicariam a síndrome de insuficiência respiratória aguda como síndrome primária. A maioria das alterações de parâmetros e outras manifestações clínicas, tais como o aumento dos níveis de interleucinas, a inflamação endotelial, a hipercoagulabilidade, a miocardite, a disgeusia, as neuropatias inflamatórias, as convulsões epiléticas e os distúrbios da memória, pode ser explicada por níveis excessivos de angiotensina II. Várias meta-análises demonstraram que o uso prévio de inibidores da enzima conversora da angiotensina (IECAs) ou antagonistas dos recetores da angiotensina (ARAs) está associado a um melhor prognóstico para a Covid-19. Deste modo, ensaios pragmáticos para avaliar os potenciais benefícios terapêuticos dos inibidores do sistema renina-angiotensina-aldosterona (SRAA) deveriam ser promovidos urgentemente pelas autoridades de saúde para se diversificar as opções terapêuticas para a Covid-19.

AB  - COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that has infected over 136 million people worldwide with over 2.9 million deaths as of 11 April 2021. In March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic and countries began to implement measures to control the spread of the virus. The spread and the death rates of the virus displayed dramatic differences among countries globally, showing that there are several factors affecting its spread and mortality. By utilizing the cumulative number of cases from John Hopkins University, the recovery rate, death rate, and the number of active, recovered, and death cases were simulated to analyse the trends and patterns within the chosen countries. 10 countries from 3 different case severity categories (high cases, medium cases, and low cases) and 5 continents (Asia, North America, South America, Europe, and Oceania) were studied. A generalized SEIR model which considers control measures such as isolation, and preventive measures such as vaccination is applied in this study. This model is able to capture not only the dynamics between the states, but also the time evolution of the states by using the fourth-order-Runge–Kutta process. This study found no significant patterns in the countries under the same case severity category, suggesting that there are other factors contributing to the pattern in these countries. One of the factors influencing the pattern in each country is the population’s age. COVID-19 related deaths were found to be notably higher among older people, indicating that countries comprising of a larger proportion of older age groups have an increased risk of experiencing higher death rates. Tighter governmental control measures led to fewer infections and eventually reduced the number of death cases, while increasing the recovery rate, and early implementations were found to be far more effective in controlling the spread of the virus and produced better outcomes.

AB  - Objectives
At the end of 2020, many countries commenced a vaccination programme against SARS-CoV-2. Public health authorities aim to prevent and interrupt outbreaks of infectious disease in social care settings. We aimed to investigate the association between the introduction of the vaccination programme and the frequency and duration of COVID-19 outbreaks in Northern Ireland (NI).
Study design
We undertook an ecological study using routinely available national data.
Methods
We used Poisson regression to measure the relationship between the number of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks in care homes, and as a measure of community COVID-19 prevalence, the Office for National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey estimated the number of people testing positive for COVID-19 in NI. We estimated the change in this relationship and estimated the expected number of care home outbreaks in the absence of the vaccination programme. A Cox proportional hazards model estimated the hazard ratio of a confirmed COVID-19 care home outbreak closure.
Results
Care home outbreaks reduced by two-thirds compared to expected following the introduction of the vaccination programme, from a projected 1625 COVID-19 outbreaks (95% prediction interval 1553–1694) between 7 December 2020 and 28 October 2021 to an observed 501. We estimated an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.53 of the outbreak closure assuming a 21-day lag for immunity.
Conclusions
These findings describe the association of the vaccination with a reduction in outbreak frequency and duration across NI care homes. This indicates probable reduced harm and disruption from COVID-19 in social care settings following vaccination. Future research using individual level data from care home residents will be needed to investigate the effectiveness of the vaccines and the duration of their effects.
