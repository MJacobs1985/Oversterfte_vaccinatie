AB  - The impact of COVID-19 has been massive and unprecedented, affecting almost every aspect of our daily lives. This paper attempts to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on the future size, composition and distribution of Australia's population by projecting a range of scenarios. Drawing on the academic literature, historical data and informed by expert judgement, four scenarios representing possible future courses of economic and demographic recovery are formulated. Results suggest that Australia's population could be 6 per cent lower by 2040 in a Longer scenario than in the No Pandemic scenario, primarily due to a huge reduction in international migration. Impacts on population ageing will be less severe, leading to a one percentage point increase in the proportion of the population aged 65 and over by 2040. Differential impacts will be felt across Australian States and Territories, with the biggest absolute and relative reductions in growth occurring in the most populous states, Victoria and New South Wales. Given the ongoing nature of the crisis at the time of writing, there remains significant uncertainty surrounding the plausibility of the proposed scenarios. Ongoing monitoring of the demographic impacts of COVID-19 are important to ensure appropriate planning and recovery in the years ahead.

AB  - Vaccination is an excellent strategy to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious disease. Vaccination creates protective, long-lived antibody-mediated immunity by inducing the germinal centre response, an intricate immune reaction that produces memory B cells and long-lived antibody-secreting plasma cells that provide protection against (re)infection. The magnitude and quality of the germinal centre response declines with age, contributing to poor vaccine-induced immunity in older individuals. T follicular helper cells are essential for the formation and function of the germinal centre response. This review will discuss how age-dependent changes in T follicular helper cells influence the germinal centre response, and the evidence that age-dependent changes need not be a barrier to successful vaccination in the later years of life.

AB  - How might COVID-19 affect human capital and wellbeing in the long run? The COVID-19 pandemic has already imposed a heavy human cost—taken together, this public health crisis and its attendant economic downturn appear poised to dwarf the scope, scale, and disruptiveness of most modern pandemics. What evidence we do have about other modern pandemics is largely limited to short-run impacts. Consequently, recent experience can do little to help us anticipate and respond to COVID-19’s potential long-run impact on individuals over decades and even generations. History, however, offers a solution. Historical crises offer closer analogues to COVID-19 in each of its key dimensions—as a global pandemic, as a global recession—and offer the runway necessary to study the life-course and intergenerational outcomes. In this paper, we review the evidence on the long-run effects on health, labor, and human capital of both historical pandemics (with a focus on the 1918 Influenza Pandemic) and historical recessions (with a focus on the Great Depression). We conclude by discussing how past crises can inform our approach to COVID-19—helping tell us what to look for, what to prepare for, and what data we ought to collect now.

AB  - COVID-19 vaccinations have been shown to be safe, efficacious, and life-saving. They, like other vaccines, do not entirely protect everyone who receives them, and no one knows how effectively they can prevent people from spreading the virus to others or whether the booster dosage is dangerous to some vulnerable people. So, in addition to getting vaccinated, we must continue with additional efforts to combat the pandemic. Quantitatively, the pragmatic, appropriate, and phenomenal mechanism of the complex spherical fuzzy set enhances the decision-making efficacy and the ordering quality of the ELECTRE I method to include a profitable and optimal approach for MAGDM. In the CSF environment, critically ill patients are investigated systematically using a pairwise comparison based ELECTRE-I technique. In this paper, we improve the precision of the CSF-based ELECTRE-I approach to an unique score function. The suggested approach’s comparability is examined with techniques that should provide equal importance to the alternatives, and the presented score function’s reliability is validated using the existing score function with the two cases.

AB  - In late December 2019, a novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered as the source of a highly contagious syndrome later named COVID-19, causing severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. As the virus spread rapidly across the globe, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic on March 12, 2020. Like many health crises throughout history, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed myriad social and health disparities that have long impacted historically vulnerable populations both in the United States and worldwide. Such disparities have manifested as disproportionate diagnoses of COVID-19 depending on race/ethnicity, differential access to testing and treatment of COVID-19, especially in the early days of the pandemic, but continuing to persist throughout, rates of severe disease and death 2–3 times higher in minoritized populations than in White Americans, and significantly lower rates of vaccine uptake in minoritized populations. This disparity has caused many to label the COVID-19 pandemic as a “syndemic.” Syndemic theory at its core rejects the notion that disease can be addressed separately from the sociostructural context in which that disease exists. It necessitates relevant social and structural factors to be considered when assessing how disease affects the population. These factors will vary by group, but may intersect, especially among individuals sharing multiple racial identities.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19, is a novel coronavirus that began sweeping the globe at the end of 2019, causing mild illness in some patients while leading to devastating shock, immune dysregulation, multiorgan failure, and even death in others. Immune dysregulation may lead to increased susceptibility to severe disease from COVID-19. Immune enhancers could aid in immune regulation and protect against severe COVID-19 infection. Herbal supplements, spices, and lifestyle modifications have been shown to enhance immune responses to a number of pathogens, which may include COVID-19. These immune enhancers could be used adjunctively with vaccines, social distancing, and pharmacologic treatments to prevent life-threatening infection in susceptible patients.

AB  - Objectives
Mounting evidence links hyperinflammation in gravely ill patients to low serum iron levels and hyperferritinemia. However, little attention has been paid to other iron-associated markers such as transferrin. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of different iron parameters in severe COVID-19 and their relation to disease severity.
Subjects and methods
This study involved 73 hospitalized patients with positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. Patients were classified into two groups according to symptom severity: mild and severe. Blood levels of anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and iron-related biomarkers were measured.
Results
The results revealed a significant increase in IL-6, CRP, and ferritin levels and decreased transferrin and iron levels in severe COVID-19. Transferrin negatively predicted variations in IgM and IgG levels (P < 0.001), as well as 34.4% and 36.6% increase in IL-6 and CRP levels, respectively (P < 0.005). Importantly, transferrin was the main negative predictor of ferritin levels, determining 22.7% of serum variations (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
Reduced serum transferrin and iron levels, along with the increased CRP and high ferritin, were strongly associated with the heightened inflammatory and immune state in COVID-19. Transferrin can be used as a valuable predictor of increased severity and progression of the disease.

AB  - The COVID-19 virus’s high transmissibility has resulted in the virus’s rapid spread throughout the world, which has brought several repercussions, ranging from a lack of sanitary and medical products to the collapse of medical systems. Hence, governments attempt to re-plan the production of medical products and reallocate limited health resources to combat the pandemic. This paper addresses a multi-period production-inventory-sharing problem (PISP) to overcome such a circumstance, considering two consumable and reusable products. We introduce a new formulation to decide on production, inventory, delivery, and sharing quantities. The sharing will depend on net supply balance, allowable demand overload, unmet demand, and the reuse cycle of reusable products. Undeniably, the dynamic demand for products during pandemic situations must be reflected effectively in addressing the multi-period PISP. A bespoke compartmental susceptible-exposed-infectious-hospitalized-recovered-susceptible (SEIHRS) epidemiological model with a control policy is proposed, which also accounts for the influence of people’s behavioral response as a result of the knowledge of adequate precautions. An accelerated Benders decomposition-based algorithm with tailored valid inequalities is offered to solve the model. Finally, we consider a realistic case study – the COVID-19 pandemic in France – to examine the computational proficiency of the decomposition method. The computational results reveal that the proposed decomposition method coupled with effective valid inequalities can solve large-sized test problems in a reasonable computational time and 9.88 times faster than the commercial Gurobi solver. Moreover, the sharing mechanism reduces the total cost of the system and the unmet demand on the average up to 32.98% and 20.96%, respectively.

AB  - There are important questions surrounding the potential contribution of outdoor and indoor air quality in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and perpetuation of COVID-19 epidemic waves. Environmental health may be a critical component of COVID-19 prevention. The public health community and health agencies should consider the evolving evidence in their recommendations and statements, and work to issue occupational guidelines. Evidence coming from the current epidemiological and experimental research is expected to add knowledge about virus diffusion, COVID-19 severity in most polluted areas, inter-personal distance requirements and need for wearing face masks in indoor or outdoor environments. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for maintaining particulate matter concentrations at low levels for multiple health-related reasons, which may also include the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Indoor environments represent even a more crucial challenge to cope with, as it is easier for the SARS-COV2 to spread, remain vital and infect other subjects in closed spaces in the presence of already infected asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic people. The potential merits of preventive measures, such as CO2 monitoring associated with natural or controlled mechanical ventilation and air purification, for schools, indoor public places (restaurants, offices, hotels, museums, theatres/cinemas etc.) and transportations need to be carefully considered. Hospital settings and nursing/retirement homes as well as emergency rooms, infectious diseases divisions and ambulances represent higher risk indoor environments and may require additional monitoring and specific decontamination strategies based on mechanical ventilation or air purification.

AB  - Rationale & Objective
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disproportionately affects people with chronic diseases such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). We assessed the incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 in people with CKD.
Study Design
Systematic review and meta-analysis by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed through February 2021.
Setting & Study Populations
People with CKD with or without COVID-19.
Selection Criteria for Studies
Cohort and case-control studies.
Data Extraction
Incidences of COVID-19, death, respiratory failure, dyspnea, recovery, intensive care admission, hospital admission, need for supplemental oxygen, hospital discharge, sepsis, short-term dialysis, acute kidney injury, and fatigue.
Analytical Approach
Random-effects meta-analysis and evidence certainty adjudicated using an adapted version of GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
Results
348 studies (382,407 participants with COVID-19 and CKD; 1,139,979 total participants with CKD) were included. Based on low-certainty evidence, the incidence of COVID-19 was higher in people with CKD treated with dialysis (105 per 10,000 person-weeks; 95% CI, 91-120; 95% prediction interval [PrI], 25-235; 59 studies; 468,233 participants) than in those with CKD not requiring kidney replacement therapy (16 per 10,000 person-weeks; 95% CI, 4-33; 95% PrI, 0-92; 5 studies; 70,683 participants) or in kidney or pancreas/kidney transplant recipients (23 per 10,000 person-weeks; 95% CI, 18-30; 95% PrI, 2-67; 29 studies; 120,281 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, the incidence of death in people with CKD and COVID-19 was 32 per 1,000 person-weeks (95% CI, 30-35; 95% PrI, 4-81; 229 studies; 70,922 participants), which may be higher than in people with CKD without COVID-19 (incidence rate ratio, 10.26; 95% CI, 6.78-15.53; 95% PrI, 2.62-40.15; 4 studies; 18,347 participants).
Limitations
Analyses were generally based on low-certainty evidence. Few studies reported outcomes in people with CKD without COVID-19 to calculate the excess risk attributable to COVID-19, and potential confounders were not adjusted for in most studies.
Conclusions
The incidence of COVID-19 may be higher in people receiving maintenance dialysis than in those with CKD not requiring kidney replacement therapy or those who are kidney or pancreas/kidney transplant recipients. People with CKD and COVID-19 may have a higher incidence of death than people with CKD without COVID-19.

AB  - The highly transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen of the COVID-19 pandemic, bring new waves of infection worldwide. Identification of effective therapeutic drugs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent global need. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), an essential enzyme for viral RNA replication, is the most promising target for antiviral drug research since it has no counterpart in human cells and shows the highest conservation across coronaviruses. This review summarizes recent progress in studies of RdRp inhibitors, focusing on interactions between these inhibitors and the enzyme complex, based on structural analysis, and their effectiveness. In addition, we propose new possible strategies to address the shortcomings of current inhibitors, which may guide the development of novel efficient inhibitors to combat COVID-19.

AB  - In December 2019, the world was introduced to a new betacoronavirus, referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) for its propensity to cause rapidly progressive lung damage, resulting in high death rates. As fast as the virus spread, it became evident that the novel coronavirus causes a multisystem disease (COVID‐19) that may involve multiple organs and has a high risk of thrombosis associated with striking elevations in pro‐inflammatory cytokines, D‐dimer, and fibrinogen, but without disseminated intravascular coagulation. Postmortem studies have confirmed the high incidence of venous thromboembolism, but also notably revealed diffuse microvascular thrombi with endothelial swelling, consistent with a thrombotic microangiopathy, and inter‐alveolar endothelial deposits of complement activation fragments. The clinicopathologic presentation of COVID‐19 thus parallels that of other thrombotic diseases, such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), that are caused by dysregulation of the complement system. This raises the specter that many of the thrombotic complications arising from SARS‐CoV‐2 infections may be triggered and/or exacerbated by excess complement activation. This is of major potential clinical relevance, as currently available anti‐complement therapies that are highly effective in protecting against thrombosis in aHUS, could be efficacious in COVID‐19. In this review, we provide mounting evidence for complement participating in the pathophysiology underlying the thrombotic diathesis associated with pathogenic coronaviruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2. Based on current knowledge of complement, coagulation and the virus, we suggest lines of study to identify novel therapeutic targets and the rationale for clinical trials with currently available anti‐complement agents for COVID‐19.

AB  - The aim of this study is to identify spatiotemporal clusters and the socioeconomic drivers of COVID-19 in Toronto. Geographical, epidemiological, and socioeconomic data from the 140 neighbourhoods in Toronto were used in this study. We used local and global Moran's I, and space-time scan statistic to identify spatial and spatiotemporal clusters of COVID-19. We also used global (spatial regression models), and local geographically weighted regression (GWR) and Multiscale Geographically weighted regression (MGWR) models to identify the globally and locally varying socioeconomic drivers of COVID-19. The global regression model identified a lower percentage of educated people and a higher percentage of immigrants in the neighbourhoods as significant predictors of COVID-19. MGWR shows the best fit model to explain the variables affecting COVID-19. The findings imply that a single intervention package for the entire area would not be an effective strategy for controlling COVID-19; a locally adaptable intervention package would be beneficial.

AB  - Objectives
The aim of this study is to provide information on changes in mental health among disadvantaged immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa in the Greater Paris area and their level of information about Covid-19.
Methods
Prior to the Covid-19 epidemic, the Makasi community-based cohort followed 850 immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa in the Greater Paris area. Between the 1st of April and the 7th of June 2020, all participants scheduled for a follow-up survey were systematically included into an additional COVID-19-related wave of data collection (N = 100). We compared participants' type of housing, level of food insecurity, work and mental health (PHQ9) before and during the first COVID-19-related lockdown, using paired-Mc Nemar chi-2 tests. We next described their level of information on Covid-19 and policy measures, broken down by sex.
Results
Among the 100 participants, 68% had no legal residence permit. Food insecurity was more often reported during lockdown than before (62% vs 52%). 9% of participants had a score indicative of severe depression (PHQ9) before lockdown and 17% afterwards (p = 0.17). Only 51% knew about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission of the COVID-19 virus.
Conclusions
This study brings original information on a hard-to-reach population group. Our results suggest that the lockdown had a detrimental impact on various economic and mental health aspects among disadvantaged migrants residing in the Greater Paris area.

AB  - Summary
Background
The objective of this study was to describe 12-month mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with a reference population with no history of SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
Nationwide cohort study using electronic health care data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive cases (n= 66,287) and reference group subjects (n=254,969) with linkage to SARS-CoV-2 testing and death records.
Findings
People infected with SARS-COV-2 had more than three times the risk of dying over the following year compared with those who remained uninfected (aHR 3·1, 95%CI 2·9-3·3). Short-term mortality (up to 5 weeks post-infection) was significantly higher among COVID-19 group (1623·0/10 000) than in the reference group (118/10 000). For COVID-19 cases aged 60 years or older, increased mortality persisted until the end of the first year after infection, and was related to increased risk for cardiovascular (aHR 2·1, 95%CI 1·8-2·3), cancer (aHR 1·5, 95%CI 1·2-1·9), respiratory system diseases (aHR 1·9, 95%CI 1·2-3·0), and other causes of death (aHR 1·8, 95%CI 1·4-2·2).
Interpretation
Increased risk of death from SARS-CoV-2 is not limited to the acute illness: SARS-CoV-2 infection carries a substantially increased mortality in the following 12 months. This excess death mainly occurs in older people and is driven by broad array of causes of death.
Funding
Research was carried out with the support of Estonian Research Council (grants PRG1197, PRG198), European Regional Development Fund (RITA 1/02-120) and European Social Fund via IT Academy program.

AB  - Summary
This study investigated whether variability in air quality, especially related to vehicular emissions, during the COVID-19 pandemic could indicate social distancing. Data from in situ measurements and satellite estimates were used. The study areas were São Paulo, Brazil, and Bologna, Italy. We focused our analysis on NO2, a combustion-derived pollutant, because of its availability in surface stations and satellite tracking, and because it has a short atmospheric lifetime. The analyses included graphical, statistical, and wavelet transform-based approaches to understand NO2 concentrations before and during the pandemic. After confirming the reduction in vehicular emissions during the pandemic, we created normalized indices to assess the social remoteness in 2020 in different locations, with a focus on São Paulo and Bologna. These indices were compared to existing indices based on cell phone mobility. The indices proposed in this study suffered high sensitivity to social distance compared to existing ones and helped to understand the actual application of social distance and contamination rates, considering the various dimensions of the problem.

AB  - Background
SARS-CoV-2 has led to a sharp increase in the number of hospitalizations and deaths from pneumonia and multiorgan disease worldwide; therefore, SARS-CoV-2 has become a global health problem. Supportive therapies remain the mainstay treatments against COVID-19, such as oxygen inhalation, antiviral drugs, and antibiotics. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been shown clinically to relieve the symptoms of COVID-19 infection, and TCMs can affect the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Jing Si Herbal Drink (JSHD), an eight herb formula jointly developed by Tzu Chi University and Tzu Chi Hospital, has shown potential as an adjuvant treatment for COVID-19 infection. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of JSHD as an adjuvant treatment in patients with COVID-19 infection is underway
Objectives
This article aims to explore the efficacy of the herbs in JSHD against COVID-19 infection from a mechanistic standpoint and provide a reference for the rational utilization of JSHD in the treatment of COVID-19.
Method
We compiled evidence of the herbs in JSHD to treat COVID-19 in vivo and in vitro.
Results
We described the efficacy and mechanism of action of the active ingredients in JSHD to treat COVID-19 based on experimental evidence. JSHD includes 5 antiviral herbs, 7 antioxidant herbs, and 7 anti-inflammatory herbs. In addition, 2 herbs inhibit the overactive immune system, 1 herb reduces cell apoptosis, and 1 herb possesses antithrombotic ability.
Conclusion
Although experimental data have confirmed that the ingredients in JSHD are effective against COVID-19, more rigorously designed studies are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of JSHD as a COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - Background and objectives: Epidemiological models of epidemic spread are an essential tool for optimizing decision-making. The current literature is very extensive and covers a wide variety of deterministic and stochastic models. However, with the increase in computing resources, new, more general, and flexible procedures based on simulation models can assess the effectiveness of measures and quantify the current state of the epidemic. This paper illustrates the potential of this approach to build a new dynamic probabilistic model to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in different compartments. Methods: We propose a new probabilistic model in which, for the first time in the epidemic literature, parameter learning is carried out using gradient-free stochastic black-box optimization techniques simulating multiple trajectories of the infection dynamics in a general way, solving an inverse problem that is defined employing the daily information from mortality records. Results: After the application of the new proposal in Spain in the first and successive waves, the result of the model confirms the accuracy to estimate the seroprevalence and allows us to know the real dynamics of the pandemic a posteriori to assess the impact of epidemiological measures by the Spanish government and to plan more efficiently the subsequent decisions with the prior knowledge obtained. Conclusions:The model results allow us to estimate the daily patterns of COVID-19 infections in Spain retrospectively and examine the population’s exposure to the virus dynamically in contrast to seroprevalence surveys. Furthermore, given the flexibility of our simulation framework, we can model situations —even using non-parametric distributions between the different compartments in the model— that other models in the existing literature cannot. Our general optimization strategy remains valid in these cases, and we can easily create other non-standard simulation epidemic models that incorporate more complex and dynamic structures.

AB  - Ferritin, which includes twenty-four light and heavy chains in varying proportions in different tissues, is primarily responsible for maintaining the body's iron metabolism. Its normal value is between 10 and 200 ngmL−1 in men and between 30 and 300 ngmL−1 in women. Iron is delivered to the tissue via them, and they act as immunomodulators, signaling molecules, and inflammatory markers. When ferritin level exceeds 1000 µgL-1, the patient is categorized as having hyperferritinemia. Iron chelators such as deferiprone, deferirox, and deferoxamine are currently FDA approved to treat iron overload. The inflammation cascade and poor prognosis of COVID-19 may be attributed to high ferritin levels. Critically ill patients can benefit from deferasirox, an iron chelator administered orally at 20–40 mgkg−1 once daily, as well as intravenous deferoxamine at 1000 mg initially followed by 500 mg every 4 to 12 h. It can be combined with monoclonal antibodies, antioxidants, corticosteroids, and lactoferrin to make iron chelation therapy effective for COVID-19 victims. In this article, we analyze the antiviral and antifibrotic activity of iron chelators, thereby promoting iron depletion therapy as a potentially innovative treatment strategy for COVID-19.

AB  - Objectives
This study aimed to explore the relationship between national governance and country response to the COVID-19 pandemic in low- and middle-income countries, to support preparedness for the next pandemic. We conducted a statistical analysis of 116 countries, examining the relationship between speed of initial response and measures of national governance.
Study design
Observational study, with individual countries as the unit of analysis.
Methods
We used logistic regression to look for associations between quicker initial government response and four national governance indicators: Government Effectiveness, Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism, Voice and Accountability, and Corruption Perceptions Index.
Results
A quicker initial government response was associated with countries with higher Government Effectiveness (OR 13.92 95% CI 3.69–52.48, p < 0.001) and lower Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09–0.57, p = 0.002). There was no relationship observed between speed of initial government response and Voice and Accountability or Corruption Perceptions Index. Other factors associated with quicker initial response were small population size, experiencing first COVID-19 case after the pandemic declaration, not having previous experience with SARS-CoV1 or MERS and not being an island nation.
Conclusions
This study shows that having higher state policy and implementation capacity, and lower political stability was associated with a quicker initial pandemic response. Limitations of this study include the use of crude national level indicators and broad categorisations of countries into quicker and slower responders. Deeper enquiry into the early decision-making processes taken at the national executive level within individual countries may help clarify the observed associations further.

AB  - Summary
Background
Before 2020, mental disorders were leading causes of the global health-related burden, with depressive and anxiety disorders being leading contributors to this burden. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has created an environment where many determinants of poor mental health are exacerbated. The need for up-to-date information on the mental health impacts of COVID-19 in a way that informs health system responses is imperative. In this study, we aimed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence and burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders globally in 2020.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review of data reporting the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic and published between Jan 1, 2020, and Jan 29, 2021. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, preprint servers, grey literature sources, and consulted experts. Eligible studies reported prevalence of depressive or anxiety disorders that were representative of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic and had a pre-pandemic baseline. We used the assembled data in a meta-regression to estimate change in the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders between pre-pandemic and mid-pandemic (using periods as defined by each study) via COVID-19 impact indicators (human mobility, daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, and daily excess mortality rate). We then used this model to estimate the change from pre-pandemic prevalence (estimated using Disease Modelling Meta-Regression version 2.1 [known as DisMod-MR 2.1]) by age, sex, and location. We used final prevalence estimates and disability weights to estimate years lived with disability and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders.
Findings
We identified 5683 unique data sources, of which 48 met inclusion criteria (46 studies met criteria for major depressive disorder and 27 for anxiety disorders). Two COVID-19 impact indicators, specifically daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and reductions in human mobility, were associated with increased prevalence of major depressive disorder (regression coefficient [B] 0·9 [95% uncertainty interval 0·1 to 1·8; p=0·029] for human mobility, 18·1 [7·9 to 28·3; p=0·0005] for daily SARS-CoV-2 infection) and anxiety disorders (0·9 [0·1 to 1·7; p=0·022] and 13·8 [10·7 to 17·0; p<0·0001]. Females were affected more by the pandemic than males (B 0·1 [0·1 to 0·2; p=0·0001] for major depressive disorder, 0·1 [0·1 to 0·2; p=0·0001] for anxiety disorders) and younger age groups were more affected than older age groups (−0·007 [–0·009 to −0·006; p=0·0001] for major depressive disorder, −0·003 [–0·005 to −0·002; p=0·0001] for anxiety disorders). We estimated that the locations hit hardest by the pandemic in 2020, as measured with decreased human mobility and daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, had the greatest increases in prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. We estimated an additional 53·2 million (44·8 to 62·9) cases of major depressive disorder globally (an increase of 27·6% [25·1 to 30·3]) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such that the total prevalence was 3152·9 cases (2722·5 to 3654·5) per 100 000 population. We also estimated an additional 76·2 million (64·3 to 90·6) cases of anxiety disorders globally (an increase of 25·6% [23·2 to 28·0]), such that the total prevalence was 4802·4 cases (4108·2 to 5588·6) per 100 000 population. Altogether, major depressive disorder caused 49·4 million (33·6 to 68·7) DALYs and anxiety disorders caused 44·5 million (30·2 to 62·5) DALYs globally in 2020.
Interpretation
This pandemic has created an increased urgency to strengthen mental health systems in most countries. Mitigation strategies could incorporate ways to promote mental wellbeing and target determinants of poor mental health and interventions to treat those with a mental disorder. Taking no action to address the burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders should not be an option.

AB  - Background and aim
The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected the world’s population in the last two years. Along with non-pharmacological public health interventions, major efforts have also been made to identify effective drugs or active substances for COVID-19 prevention and treatment. These include, among many others, the trace elements zinc and selenium, based on laboratory studies and some observational human studies. However, both of these study designs are not adequate to identify and approve treatments in human medicine, and experimental studies in the form of randomized controlled trials are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness and the safety of any interventions.
Methods
We undertook a systematic review in which we searched for published and unpublished clinical trials using zinc or selenium supplementation to treat or prevent COVID-19 in the Pubmed, Scopus and ClinicalTrials databases up to 10 January 2022.
Results
Amongst the published studies, we did not find any trial with selenium, whereas we retrieved four eligible randomized clinical trials using zinc supplementation, only one of which was double-blind. One of these trials looked at the effect of the intervention on the rate of new SARS-CoV-2 infections, and three at the COVID-19 clinical outcome in already infected individuals. The study populations of the four trials were very heterogeneous, ranging from uninfected individuals to those hospitalized for COVID-19. Only two studies investigated zinc alone in the intervention arm with no differences in the endpoints. The other two studies examined zinc in association with one or more drugs and supplements in the intervention arm, therefore making it impossible to disentangle any specific effects of the element. In addition, we identified 22 unpublished ongoing clinical trials, 19 on zinc, one on selenium and two on both elements.
Conclusion
No trials investigated the effect of selenium supplementation on COVID-19, while the very few studies on the effects of zinc supplementation did not confirm efficacy. Therefore, preventive or therapeutic interventions against COVID-19 based on zinc or selenium supplementation are currently unjustified, although when the results of the on-going studies are published, this may change our conclusion.

AB  - The emergence of a new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a major global concern that has damaged human health and disturbing environmental quality. Some researchers have identified a positive relationship between air pollution (fine particulate matter PM2.5) and COVID-19. Nonetheless, no inclusive investigation has comprehensively examined this relationship for a tropical climate such as India. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by investigating the nexus between air pollution and COVID-19 in the ten most affected Indian states using daily observations from 9th March to September 20, 2020. The study has used the newly developed Hidden Panel Cointegration test and Nonlinear Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NPARDL) model for asymmetric analysis. Empirical results illustrate an asymmetric relationship between PM2.5 and COVID-19 cases. More precisely, a 1% change in the positive shocks of PM2.5 increases the COVID-19 cases by 0.439%. Besides, the estimates of individual states expose the heterogeneous effects of PM2.5 on COVID-19. The asymmetric causality test of Hatemi-J's (2011) also suggests that the positive shocks on PM2.5 Granger-cause positive shocks on COVID19 cases. Research findings indicate that air pollution is the root cause of this outbreak; thus, the government should recognize this channel and implement robust policy guidelines to control the spread of environmental pollution.

AB  - Background
The impact of a postoperative diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA) remains unknown. The objective of this study is to characterize the effect of COVID-19 infection following TJA on perioperative complication rates.
Methods
The Mariner database was queried for patients undergoing total hip and total knee arthroplasty from January 2018 to April 2020. TJA patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 within 90 days postoperatively were matched in a 1:3 fashion based on age, gender, iron deficiency anemia, payer status, and Charlson Comorbidity Index with patients who were not diagnosed with COVID-19. Preoperative comorbidity profiles and complications within 3 months of surgery were compared. Statistical analysis included chi-squared tests and multivariate logistic regression with outcomes considered significant at P < .05.
Results
Of the 239 COVID-19 positive patients, 132 (55.2%) underwent total hip arthroplasty. On multivariate analysis, COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with increased odds of deep vein thrombosis (odds ratio [OR] 4.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.10-11.81, P < .001), pulmonary embolism (OR 6.27, 95% CI 2.57-16.71, P < .001), and all complications (OR 3.36, 95% CI 2.47-4.59, P < .001). Incidence of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism was greater the closer in time the COVID-19 diagnosis was to the surgical procedure (10.24 times at 1 month, 7.87 times at 2 months, and 1.42 times at 3 months; P < .001). A similar relationship was observed with all complications.
Conclusion
Postoperative COVID-19 infection is associated with higher rates of cardiopulmonary complications, thromboembolic disease, renal injury, and urinary tract infections in patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty. COVID-19 infection earlier in the postoperative period is associated with a higher risk of complications.

AB  - The article describes the possible pathophysiological origin of COVID-19 and the crucial role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), providing several “converging” evidence in support of this hypothesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to initially upregulate ACE2 systemic activity (early phase), which can subsequently induce compensatory responses leading to upregulation of both arms of the RAS (late phase) and consequently to critical, advanced and untreatable stages of COVID-19 disease. The main and initial actors of the process are ACE2 and ADAM17 zinc-metalloproteases, which, initially triggered by SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, work together in increasing circulating Ang 1–7 and Ang 1–9 peptides and downstream (Mas and Angiotensin type 2 receptors) pathways with anti-inflammatory, hypotensive and antithrombotic activities. During the late phase of severe COVID-19, compensatory secretion of renin and ACE enzymes are subsequently upregulated, leading to inflammation, hypertension and thrombosis, which further sustain ACE2 and ADAM17 upregulation. Based on this hypothesis, COVID-19-phase-specific inhibition of different RAS enzymes is proposed as a pharmacological strategy against COVID-19 and vaccine-induced adverse effects. The aim is to prevent the establishment of positive feedback-loops, which can sustain hyperactivity of both arms of the RAS independently of viral trigger and, in some cases, may lead to Long-COVID syndrome.

Data are observed over time, spanning from the last week of February 2020 to the first week of February 2021. Dealing with geographical units observed at several time occasions, the proposed fuzzy clustering model embedded both space and time information. Properly, an Exponential distance-based Fuzzy Partitioning Around Medoids algorithm with spatial penalty term has been proposed to classify the spline representation of the time trajectories. The results show that the heterogeneity among regions along with the spatial contiguity is essential to understand the spread of the pandemic and to design effective policies to mitigate the effects.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented health, economic, and social consequences worldwide. Although contact reductions and wearing face coverings have reduced infection rates, and vaccines have reduced illness severity, emergence of new variants of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and the shift from pandemic to endemic patterns of infection, highlights the importance of ongoing preventive behavior adherence to manage future outbreaks. Research applying social cognition theories may assist in explaining variance in these behaviors and inform the development of efficacious behavior change interventions to promote adherence. In the present article, we summarize research applying these theories to identify modifiable determinants of COVID-19 preventive behaviors and the mechanisms involved, and their utility in informing interventions. We identify limitations of these applications (e.g., overreliance on correlational data, lack of long-term behavioral follow-up), and suggest how they can be addressed. We demonstrate the virtue of augmenting theories with additional constructs (e.g., moral norms, anticipated regret) and processes (e.g., multiple action phases, automatic processes) to provide comprehensive, parsimonious behavioral explanations. We also outline how the theories contribute to testing mechanisms of action of behavioral interventions. Finally, we recommend future studies applying these theories to inform and test interventions to promote COVID-19 preventive behavior adherence.

During the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, EASL and ESCMID published a position paper to provide guidance for physicians involved in the care of patients with chronic liver disease. While some healthcare systems are returning to a more normal routine, many countries and healthcare systems have been, or still are, overwhelmed by the pandemic, which is significantly impacting on the care of these patients. In addition, many studies have been published focusing on how COVID-19 may affect the liver and how pre-existing liver diseases might influence the clinical course of COVID-19. While many aspects remain poorly understood, it has become increasingly evident that pre-existing liver diseases and liver injury during the disease course must be kept in mind when caring for patients with COVID-19. This review should serve as an update on the previous position paper, summarising the evidence for liver disease involvement during COVID-19 and providing recommendations on how to return to routine care wherever possible.

AB  - The outbreak of SARS-COV-2 has led to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 and caused over 4.5 million deaths worldwide by September 2021. Besides the public health crisis, COVID-19 affectedthe globaleconomy and development significantly. It also led to changes in people’s mobility and lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to short-term changes, the drastic transformation of the world may account for the potentially disruptive long-term impacts. Recognizing the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial in mitigating the negative behavioral changes that directly relate to people’s psychological and social well-being. It is important to stress that citizens and governments face an uncertain situation since nobody knows exactly how the viruses and cures will develop. Better understanding of uncertainties and evaluating behavioral changes contribute to addressing the future of urban development, public transportation, and behavioral strategies to tackle COVID-19 negative consequences. The major sources of impacts on short-term (route, departure time, mode, teleshopping, and teleworking) and medium and long-term (car ownership, work location, choice of job, and residential location) mobility decisions are mostly reviewed and discussed in this paper.

AB  - Healthcare worker (HCW) mental well-being has become a global public health priority as health systems seek to strengthen their resilience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysing data from the Health System Response Monitor, we present six case studies (Denmark, Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Romania, and the United Kingdom) as a comparative review of policy interventions supporting HCW mental health during the pandemic. The results illustrate a wide range of interventions. While Denmark and the United Kingdom built on pre-existing structures to support HCW mental wellbeing during the pandemic, the other countries required new interventions. Across all cases, there was a reliance on self-care resources, online training tools, and remote professional support. Based on our analysis, we develop four policy recommendations for the future of HCW mental health supports. First, HCW mental health should be seen as a core facet of health workforce capacity. Second, effective mental health supports requires an integrated psychosocial approach that acknowledges the importance of harm prevention strategies and organisational resources (psychological first aid) alongside targeted professional interventions. Third, personal, professional and practical obstacles to take-up of mental health supports should be addressed. Fourth, any specific support or intervention targeting HCW's mental health is connected to, and dependent on, wider structural and employment factors (e.g. system resourcing and organisation) that determine the working conditions of HCWs.

AB  - In December 2019, a new Coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), appeared in China, spreading rapidly around the globe and becoming a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of a serious life-threatening disease known as COVID-19. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with preexisting systemic autoimmune diseases (AID) appears to be slightly higher than in the general population, but the clinical course does not appear to be different. However, we must bear in mind that the use of corticosteroids, immunomodulatory drugs, and biological therapy in patients with AID can modulate the risk of hospitalization and death. The alterations in the innate and adaptive immune response found in patients with cytokine storm due to COVID-19 are the reasons for the high morbidity and mortality. Thus, clinicians should early identify the symptoms and closely monitor patients with risk factors for developing these complications and the interactions with other systems such as the immune-neuro-endocrine system.

AB  - Background
There is mounting evidence related to the association between obesity and severity of COVID-19. However, the direct relationship of the increase in the severe COVID-19 risk factors, with an increase in body mass index (BMI), has not yet been evaluated.
Aim
This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the dose–response relationship between body mass index (BMI) and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.
Methods
A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Europe PMC, ProQuest, and the Cochrane Central Database. The primary outcome was composite poor outcome composed of mortality and severity. The secondary outcomes were mortality and severity.
Results
A total of 34,390 patients from 12 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis demonstrated that obesity was associated with composite poor outcome (OR 1.73 [1.40, 2.14], P<0.001; I2: 55.6%), mortality (OR 1.55 [1.16, 2.06], P=0.003; I2: 74.4%), and severity (OR 1.90 [1.45, 2.48], P<0.001; I2: 5.2%) in patients with COVID-19. A pooled analysis of highest BMI versus reference BMI indicate that a higher BMI in the patients was associated with composite poor outcome (aOR 3.02 [1.82, 5.00], P<0.001; I2: 59.8%), mortality (aOR 2.85 [1.17, 6.92], P=0.002; I2: 79.7%), and severity (aOR 3.08 [1.78, 5.33], P<0.001; I2: 11.7%). The dose–response meta-analysis showed an increased risk of composite poor outcome by aOR of 1.052 [1.028, 1.077], P<0.001 for every 5kg/m2 increase in BMI (Pnon-linearity<0.001). The curve became steeper with increasing BMI.
Conclusion
Dose–response meta-analysis demonstrated that increased BMI was associated with increased poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.

The sample period was from 11 March 2020–19 January 2022, divided into sub-samples based on four waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, we use the time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) model besides the frequency-dependent connectedness network approach. The key findings are as follows. First, the results demonstrate that the MCI is a net receiver of shocks in all waves, and the highest level of connectedness occurs in the first wave. The findings concerning volatility are similar, with the majority of MSCI Climate Change Indices being net transmitters, potentially indicating the severity of the pandemic. Second, estimating the short-, medium-, and long-term return network connectedness indicates the dominance of strong-term connectedness suggesting the spread of shocks within a week. Our results are robust by replacing MCI with Panic Index (PI). These results have implications for investors and policymakers.

AB  - Summary
The emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) threaten the effectiveness of current COVID-19 vaccines administered intramuscularly and designed to only target the spike protein. There is a pressing need to develop next-generation vaccine strategies for broader and long-lasting protection. Using adenoviral vectors (Ad) of human and chimpanzee origin, we evaluated Ad-vectored trivalent COVID-19 vaccines expressing spike-1, nucleocapsid, and RdRp antigens in murine models. We show that single-dose intranasal immunization, particularly with chimpanzee Ad-vectored vaccine, is superior to intramuscular immunization in induction of the tripartite protective immunity consisting of local and systemic antibody responses, mucosal tissue-resident memory T cells and mucosal trained innate immunity. We further show that intranasal immunization provides protection against both the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and two VOC, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Our findings indicate that respiratory mucosal delivery of Ad-vectored multivalent vaccine represents an effective next-generation COVID-19 vaccine strategy to induce all-around mucosal immunity against current and future VOC.

AB  - Summary
Background
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK first adopted physical distancing measures in March, 2020. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 became available in December, 2020. We explored the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 immunisation alongside physical distancing in the UK to gain insights about possible future scenarios in a post-vaccination era.
Methods
We used an age-structured dynamic transmission and economic model to explore different scenarios of UK mass immunisation programmes over 10 years. We compared vaccinating 75% of individuals aged 20 years or older (and annually revaccinating 50% of individuals aged 20–64 years and 75% of individuals aged 65 years or older) to no vaccination. We assumed either 50% vaccine efficacy against disease and 45-week protection (worst-case scenario) or 95% vaccine efficacy against infection and 3-year protection (best-case scenario). Natural immunity was assumed to wane within 45 weeks. We also explored the additional impact of physical distancing on vaccination by assuming either an initial lockdown followed by voluntary physical distancing, or an initial lockdown followed by increased physical distancing mandated above a certain threshold of incident daily infections. We considered benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs, both to the health-care payer and the national economy. We discounted future costs and QALYs at 3·5% annually and assumed a monetary value per QALY of £20 000 and a conservative long-run cost per vaccine dose of £15. We explored and varied these parameters in sensitivity analyses. We expressed the health and economic benefits of each scenario with the net monetary value: QALYs × (monetary value per QALY) – costs.
Findings
Without the initial lockdown, vaccination, and increased physical distancing, we estimated 148·0 million (95% uncertainty interval 48·5–198·8) COVID-19 cases and 3·1 million (0·84–4·5) deaths would occur in the UK over 10 years. In the best-case scenario, vaccination minimises community transmission without future periods of increased physical distancing, whereas SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic with biannual epidemics in the worst-case scenario. Ongoing transmission is also expected in intermediate scenarios with vaccine efficacy similar to published clinical trial data. From a health-care perspective, introducing vaccination leads to incremental net monetary values ranging from £12·0 billion to £334·7 billion in the best-case scenario and from –£1·1 billion to £56·9 billion in the worst-case scenario. Incremental net monetary values of increased physical distancing might be negative from a societal perspective if national economy losses are persistent and large.
Interpretation
Our model findings highlight the substantial health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Smaller outbreaks could continue even with vaccines, but population-wide implementation of increased physical distancing might no longer be justifiable. Our study provides early insights about possible future post-vaccination scenarios from an economic and epidemiological perspective.

AB  - COVID-19 led to significant and dynamic shifts in power relations within and between governments, teaching us how governments make health policies and how health crises affect government. We focus on centralization and decentralization within and between governments: within government, meaning the extent to which the head of government controls policy; and between governments, meaning the extent to which the central government pre-empts or controls local and regional government. Political science literature suggests that shifting patterns of centralization and decentralization can be explained by leading politicians' efforts to gain credit for popular actions and outcomes and deflect blame for unpopular ones. We test this hypothesis in two ways: by coding the Health Systems Response Monitor's data on government responses, and through case studies of the governance of COVID-19 in Austria, Czechia and France. We find that credit and blame do substantially explain the timing and direction of changes in centralization and decentralization. In the first wave, spring 2020, heads of government centralized and raised their profile in order to gain credit for decisive action, but they subsequently tried to decentralize in order to avoid blame for repeated restrictions on life or surges of infection. These findings should shape advice on governance for pandemic response

AB  - Objectives
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the extreme vulnerability of older people and other individuals who reside in long-term care, creating an urgent need for evidence-based policy that can adequately protect these community members. This study aimed to provide synthesized evidence to support policy decision making.
Design
Rapid narrative review investigating strategies that have prevented or mitigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission in long-term care.
Setting and Participants
Residents and staff in care settings such as nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
Methods
PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were systematically searched, with studies describing potentially effective strategies included. Studies were excluded if they did not report empirical evidence (eg, commentaries and consensus guidelines). Study quality was appraised on the basis of study design; data were extracted from published reports and synthesized narratively using tabulated data extracts and summary tables.
Results
Searches yielded 713 articles; 80 papers describing 77 studies were included. Most studies were observational, with no randomized controlled trials identified. Intervention studies provided strong support for widespread surveillance, early identification and response, and rigorous infection prevention and control measures. Symptom- or temperature-based screening and single point-prevalence testing were found to be ineffective, and serial universal testing of residents and staff was considered crucial. Attention to ventilation and environmental management, digital health applications, and acute sector support were also considered beneficial although evidence for effectiveness was lacking. In observational studies, staff represented substantial transmission risk and workforce management strategies were important components of pandemic response. Higher-performing facilities with less crowding and higher nurse staffing ratios had reduced transmission rates. Outbreak investigations suggested that facility-level leadership, intersectoral collaboration, and policy that facilitated access to critical resources were all significant enablers of success.
Conclusions and Implications
High-quality evidence of effectiveness in protecting LTCFs from COVID-19 was limited at the time of this study, though it continues to emerge. Despite widespread COVID-19 vaccination programs in many countries, continuing prevention and mitigation measures may be required to protect vulnerable long-term care residents from COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. This rapid review summarizes current evidence regarding strategies that may be effective.

AB  - Summary
Background
The medium-term and long-term impact of COVID-19 in patients with cancer is not yet known. In this study, we aimed to describe the prevalence of COVID-19 sequelae and their impact on the survival of patients with cancer. We also aimed to describe patterns of resumption and modifications of systemic anti-cancer therapy following recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods
OnCovid is an active European registry study enrolling consecutive patients aged 18 years or older with a history of solid or haematological malignancy and who had a diagnosis of RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this retrospective study, patients were enrolled from 35 institutions across Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. Patients who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between Feb 27, 2020, and Feb 14, 2021, and entered into the registry at the point of data lock (March 1, 2021), were eligible for analysis. The present analysis was focused on COVID-19 survivors who underwent clinical reassessment at each participating institution. We documented prevalence of COVID-19 sequelae and described factors associated with their development and their association with post-COVID-19 survival, which was defined as the interval from post-COVID-19 reassessment to the patients’ death or last follow-up. We also evaluated resumption of systemic anti-cancer therapy in patients treated within 4 weeks of COVID-19 diagnosis. The OnCovid study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04393974.
Findings
2795 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between Feb 27, 2020, and Feb 14, 2021, were entered into the study by the time of the data lock on March 1, 2021. After the exclusion of ineligible patients, the final study population consisted of 2634 patients. 1557 COVID-19 survivors underwent a formal clinical reassessment after a median of 22·1 months (IQR 8·4–57·8) from cancer diagnosis and 44 days (28–329) from COVID-19 diagnosis. 234 (15·0%) patients reported COVID-19 sequelae, including respiratory symptoms (116 [49·6%]) and residual fatigue (96 [41·0%]). Sequelae were more common in men (vs women; p=0·041), patients aged 65 years or older (vs other age groups; p=0·048), patients with two or more comorbidities (vs one or none; p=0·0006), and patients with a history of smoking (vs no smoking history; p=0·0004). Sequelae were associated with hospitalisation for COVID-19 (p<0·0001), complicated COVID-19 (p<0·0001), and COVID-19 therapy (p=0·0002). With a median post-COVID-19 follow-up of 128 days (95% CI 113–148), COVID-19 sequelae were associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 1·80 [95% CI 1·18–2·75]) after adjusting for time to post-COVID-19 reassessment, sex, age, comorbidity burden, tumour characteristics, anticancer therapy, and COVID-19 severity. Among 466 patients on systemic anti-cancer therapy, 70 (15·0%) permanently discontinued therapy, and 178 (38·2%) resumed treatment with a dose or regimen adjustment. Permanent treatment discontinuations were independently associated with an increased risk of death (HR 3·53 [95% CI 1·45–8·59]), but dose or regimen adjustments were not (0·84 [0·35–2·02]).
Interpretation
Sequelae post-COVID-19 affect up to 15% of patients with cancer and adversely affect survival and oncological outcomes after recovery. Adjustments to systemic anti-cancer therapy can be safely pursued in treatment-eligible patients.

AB  - Summary
Disruptions to cancer screening services have been experienced in most settings as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ideally, programmes would resolve backlogs by temporarily expanding capacity; however, in practice, this is often not possible. We aim to inform the deliberations of decision makers in high-income settings regarding their cervical cancer screening policy response. We caution against performance measures that rely solely on restoring testing volumes to pre-pandemic levels because they will be less effective at mitigating excess cancer diagnoses than will targeted measures. These measures might exacerbate pre-existing inequalities in accessing cervical screening by disregarding the risk profile of the individuals attending. Modelling of cervical screening outcomes before and during the pandemic supports risk-based strategies as the most effective way for screening services to recover. The degree to which screening is organised will determine the feasibility of deploying some risk-based strategies, but implementation of age-based risk stratification should be universally feasible.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the death of over half a million Americans, leaving in its wake widespread grief and despair. Using national survey data (n ​= ​1998) and a treatment-weighting strategy, this study examines how COVID-19 bereavement associates with depressive symptoms and binge drinking. After adjustment for non-random exposure to COVID-19 bereavement, I find that respondents who have lost someone close to them to the virus report greater depressive symptomology and more frequent binge drinking. Among essential workers, the loss of a close tie to COVID-19 exacerbates these associations, with bereavement posing stronger effects for depressive symptoms and binge drinking for members of this group. The implications of these findings for the long-term mental health of the bereaved and those most vulnerable to the virus are discussed.

AB  - COVID-19 has a dramatic impact on human health, besides respiratory system, reproduction system would be impaired by SARS-CoV-2. For male, the virus has various negative impacts on testes, including overheating and hormone level fluctuation, which have impacts on the spermatogenesis or spermatogonia development. For female, COVID-19 may increase the risk of endocrine and metabolic dysfunction. However, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the ovaries is not clear, and further researches are needed to clarify it. Nearly 60% of the pregnant women develop symptoms of infection and more attention should be paid to the increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and severe infection. For the newborns of infected pregnant women, vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear, and further evaluation are required. Meantime, the pregnant women's fear of the potential infection may reduce their access to the prenatal genetic test. In this chapter, we summarize the latest basic and clinical researches on COVID-19 impacts on male, female reproduction, and prenatal genetic test, hoping to provide guidance and advice for people of reproductive age and reproductive healthcare practitioners.

AB  - In this paper, we study the impact of news and sentiments related to covid-19 on United Kingdom (UK)'s stock returns from February 4, 2020 to December 7, 2020. Our results show that covid-19 daily cases exert a significant negative effect on stock returns whereas covid-19 daily deaths have a significant positive impact. These findings hold when covid-related news and sentiments indices are controlled with the 2nd wave data, and when the US policies and equity market volatilities from infectious diseases are used as controls. The magnitude of the effect of covid cases and deaths indicates that the pandemic is not very harmful to the UK stock market.

AB  - The exposure-lag response of air temperature on daily COVID-19 incidence is unclear and there have been concerns regarding the robustness of previous studies. Here we present an analysis of high spatial and temporal resolution using the distributed lag non-linear modelling (DLNM) framework. Utilising nearly two years’ worth of data, we fit statistical models to twelve Italian cities to quantify the delayed effect of air temperature on daily COVID-19 incidence, accounting for several categories of potential confounders (meteorological, air quality and non-pharmaceutical interventions). Coefficients and covariance matrices for the temperature term were then synthesised using random effects meta-analysis to yield pooled estimates of the exposure-lag response with effects presented as the relative risk (RR) and cumulative RR (RRcum). The cumulative exposure response curve was non-linear, with peak risk at 15.1 °C and declining risk at progressively lower and higher temperatures. The lowest RRcum at 0.2 °C is 0.72 [0.56,0.91] times that of the highest risk. Due to this non-linearity, the shape of the lag response curve necessarily varied by temperature. This work suggests that on a given day, air temperature approximately 15 °C maximises the incidence of COVID-19, with the effects distributed in the subsequent ten days or more.

AB  - Summary
Lung infection during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor induces a cytokine storm. However, the precise mechanisms involved in severe COVID-19 pneumonia are unknown. Here, we showed that interleukin-10 (IL-10) induced the expression of ACE2 in normal alveolar macrophages, causing them to become vectors for SARS-CoV-2. The inhibition of this system in hamster models attenuated SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Genome-wide association and quantitative trait locus analyses identified a IFNAR2-IL10RB readthrough transcript, COVID-19 infectivity-enhancing dual receptor (CiDRE), which was highly expressed in patients harboring COVID-19 risk variants at the IFNAR2 locus. We showed that CiDRE exerted synergistic effects via the IL-10-ACE2 axis in alveolar macrophages and functioned as a decoy receptor for type I interferons. Collectively, our data show that high IL-10 and CiDRE expression are potential risk factors for severe COVID-19. Thus, IL-10R and CiDRE inhibitors might be useful COVID-19 therapies.

AB  - Background
Gestational diabetes mellitus is one of the most frequent pregnancy complications with a global prevalence of 13.4% in 2021. Pregnant women with COVID-19 and gestational diabetes mellitus are 3.3 times more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit than women without gestational diabetes mellitus. Data on the association of gestational diabetes mellitus with maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection are lacking.
Objective
This study aimed to investigate whether gestational diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for adverse maternal and fetal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19.
Study Design
The COVID-19-Related Obstetric and Neonatal Outcome Study is a registry-based multicentric prospective observational study from Germany and Linz, Austria. Pregnant women with clinically confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled between April 3, 2020, and August 24, 2021, at any stage of pregnancy. Obstetricians and neonatologists of 115 hospitals actively provided data to the COVID-19-Related Obstetric and Neonatal Outcome Study. For collecting data, a cloud-based electronic data platform was developed. Women and neonates were observed until hospital discharge. Information on demographic characteristics, comorbidities, medical history, COVID-19–associated symptoms and treatments, pregnancy, and birth outcomes were entered by the local sites. Information on the periconceptional body mass index was collected. A primary combined maternal endpoint was defined as (1) admission to an intensive care unit (including maternal mortality), (2) viral pneumonia, and/or (3) oxygen supplementation. A primary combined fetal and neonatal endpoint was defined as (1) stillbirth at ≥24 0/7 weeks of gestation, (2) neonatal death ≤7 days after delivery, and/or (3) transfer to a neonatal intensive care unit. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the modulating effect of gestational diabetes mellitus on the defined endpoints.
Results
Of the 1490 women with COVID-19 (mean age, 31.0±5.2 years; 40.7% nulliparous), 140 (9.4%) were diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus; of these, 42.9% were treated with insulin. Overall, gestational diabetes mellitus was not associated with an adverse maternal outcome (odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.88–2.57). However, in women who were overweight or obese, gestational diabetes mellitus was independently associated with the primary maternal outcome (adjusted odds ratio, 2.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.43–5.07). Women who were overweight or obese with gestational diabetes mellitus requiring insulin treatment were found to have an increased risk of a severe course of COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio, 3.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–6.73). Adverse maternal outcomes were more common when COVID-19 was diagnosed with or shortly after gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosis than COVID-19 diagnosis before gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosis (19.6% vs 5.6%; P<.05). Maternal gestational diabetes mellitus and maternal preconception body mass index of ≥25 kg/m2 increased the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes (adjusted odds ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–3.18). Furthermore, overweight and obesity (irrespective of gestational diabetes mellitus status) were influential factors for the maternal (adjusted odds ratio, 1.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.26–2.75) and neonatal (adjusted odds ratio, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.32–2.48) primary endpoints compared with underweight or normal weight.
Conclusion
Gestational diabetes mellitus, combined with periconceptional overweight or obesity, was independently associated with a severe maternal course of COVID-19, especially when the mother required insulin and COVID-19 was diagnosed with or after gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosis. These combined factors exhibited a moderate effect on neonatal outcomes. Women with gestational diabetes mellitus and a body mass index of ≥25 kg/m2 were a particularly vulnerable group in the case of COVID-19.

AB  - ABSTRACT
For over a year, the world has been gripped by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has had far-reaching effects on society. The integrity of national health care systems has also been challenged, owing to shifts in guidance and misinformation. Although initial reports suggested that pregnant people were not at increased risk of severe COVID-19, current data arising from the “third wave” paint a much more concerning picture. In addition, pregnant and lactating people were excluded from vaccine trials, which has hindered the ability of health care professionals to provide evidence-based counselling regarding the safety and efficacy of the available vaccines in these populations. This commentary reviews the current data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy. The evidence is clear that the risks of hospitalization and severe maternal and potentially fetal morbidity from COVID-19 in pregnancy far outweigh the very minimal risks of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy.
RÉSUMÉ
Depuis plus d'un an déjà, le monde est frappé par la pandémie de maladie à coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), dont la portée s'étend à toute la société. L'intégrité des systèmes de santé nationaux a aussi été remise en question à cause des changements de directives et de la mésinformation. Bien que les rapports initiaux aient laissé entendre que les personnes enceintes n'étaient pas plus susceptibles de développer une atteinte sévère de la COVID-19, les données actuelles colligées dans la ≪ troisième vague ≫ brossent un portrait beaucoup plus préoccupant. De plus, les personnes enceintes ou allaitantes ont été exclues des essais sur les vaccins, ce qui nuit à la capacité des professionnels de la santé de donner des conseils fondés sur des données probantes relativement à l'innocuité et à l'efficacité des vaccins disponibles chez ces populations. Le présent commentaire examine les données actuelles sur l'innocuité des vaccins anti-COVID-19 administrés pendant la grossesse. Les données montrent clairement que les risques d'hospitalisation et de morbidité maternelle, et potentiellement fœtale, grave associés à la COVID-19 pendant la grossesse sont nettement plus importants que les risques minimes associés à la vaccination contre la COVID-19 pendant la grossesse.

AB  - While the swift development and production of a COVID-19 vaccine has been a remarkable success, it is equally crucial to ensure that the vaccine is allocated and distributed in a timely and efficient manner. Prior research on pandemic supply chain has not fully incorporated the underlying factors and constraints in designing a vaccine allocation model. This study proposes an innovative vaccine allocation model to contain the spread of infectious diseases incorporating key contributing factors to the risk of uninoculated people including susceptibility rate and exposure risk. Analyses of the data collected from the state of Victoria in Australia show that a vaccine allocation model can deliver a superior performance in minimizing the risk of unvaccinated people when a multi-period approach is employed and augmenting operational mechanisms including transshipment between medical centers, capacity sharing, and mobile units being integrated into the vaccine allocation model.

AB  - Evidence shows that chronic diseases are associated with COVID-19 severity and death. This study aims to estimate the fraction of hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 attributable to chronic diseases associated to poor nutrition and smoking among adults who tested positive to COVID-19 in Mexico. We analyzed 1,006,541 adults aged ≥20 who tested positive for COVID-19 from March 23 to December 5, 2020. Six chronic diseases were considered: obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We calibrated the database using a bias quantification method to consider undiagnosed disease cases. To estimate the total impact of multiple diseases, we defined a multimorbidity variable according to the number of diseases. Risks of hospitalization and death were estimated with Poisson regression models and used to calculate population attributable fractions (PAFs). Chronic diseases accounted for to 25.4% [95% CI: 24.8%–26.1%], 28.3% (95% CI: 27.8%–28.7%) and 15.3% (95% CI: 14.9%–15.7%) of the hospitalizations among adults below 40, 40–59, and 60 years and older, respectively. For COVID-19-related deaths, 50.1% (95% CI: 48.6%–51.5%), 40.5% (95% CI: 39.7%–41.3%), and 18.7% (95% CI, 18.0%–19.5%) were attributable to chronic diseases in adults under 40, 40–59, and 60 years and older, respectively. Chronic diseases linked to poor nutrition and smoking could have contributed to a large burden of hospitalization and deaths from COVID-19 in Mexico, particularly among younger adults. Medical and structural interventions to curb chronic disease incidence and facilitate disease control are urgently needed.

AB  - Although vaccination is a cost-effective way to control infectious diseases, it is often met with popular resistance. Studying smallpox in 19th century Germany, this paper explores how economic incentives contribute to this phenomenon. The paper adds to the literature by combining mathematical epidemiology and unpublished archival evidence from two German states - Baden and Wurttemberg. The two states are an intriguing case because their initial conditions and vaccination laws were similar. Despite this, Baden experienced lower smallpox prevalence and higher vaccination uptake than Wurttemberg. The epidemiological model predicts that incentives to vaccinate decline rapidly when immunization reduces prevalence. The archival evidence reveals that Baden offset this decline by creating a public vaccination system which reduced costs for vaccinees and vaccinators alike. This suggests that the high fixed costs of centralized immunization policies can be compensated by economies of scale and popular acceptance.

AB  - Summary
The significant morbidity and mortality of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) prompted a global race to develop new therapies. These include interventions using cell- or cell-derived products, several of which are being tested in well-designed, properly controlled clinical trials. Yet, the search for cell-based COVID-19 treatments has also been fraught with hyperbolic claims; flouting of crucial regulatory, scientific, and ethical norms; and distorted communication of research findings. In this paper, we critically examine ethical issues and public communication challenges related to the development of cell-based therapeutics for COVID-19. Drawing on the lessons learned from this ongoing process, we argue against the rushed development of cell-based interventions. We conclude by outlining ways to improve the ethical conduct of cell-based clinical investigations and public communication of therapeutic claims.

AB  - The SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) causes Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), is an emerging viral infection. SARS CoV-2 infects target cells by attaching to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE2). SARS CoV-2 could cause cardiac damage in patients with severe COVID-19, as ACE2 is expressed in cardiac cells, including cardiomyocytes, pericytes, and fibroblasts, and coronavirus could directly infect these cells. Cardiovascular disorders are the most frequent comorbidity found in COVID-19 patients. Immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and T cells may produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis if their functions are uncontrolled. This causes a cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients, which has been associated with cardiac damage. Tregs are a subset of immune cells that regulate immune and inflammatory responses. Tregs suppress inflammation and improve cardiovascular function through a variety of mechanisms. This is an exciting research area to explore the cellular, molecular, and immunological mechanisms related to reducing risks of cardiovascular complications in severe COVID-19. This review evaluated whether Tregs can affect COVID-19-related cardiovascular complications, as well as the mechanisms through which Tregs act.

AB  - Background
Changes in the management of patients with cancer and delays in treatment delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the use of hospital resources and cancer mortality.
Patients and methods
Patient flows, patient pathways and use of hospital resources during the pandemic were simulated using a discrete event simulation model and patient-level data from a large French comprehensive cancer centre's discharge database, considering two scenarios of delays: massive return of patients from November 2020 (early-return) or March 2021 (late-return). Expected additional cancer deaths at 5 years and mortality rate were estimated using individual hazard ratios based on literature.
Results
The number of patients requiring hospital care during the simulation period was 13,000. In both scenarios, 6–8% of patients were estimated to present a delay of >2 months. The overall additional cancer deaths at 5 years were estimated at 88 in early-return and 145 in late-return scenario, with increased additional deaths estimated for sarcomas, gynaecological, liver, head and neck, breast cancer and acute leukaemia. This represents a relative additional cancer mortality rate at 5 years of 4.4 and 6.8% for patients expected in year 2020, 0.5 and 1.3% in 2021 and 0.5 and 0.5% in 2022 for each scenario, respectively.
Conclusions
Pandemic-related diagnostic and treatment delays in patients with cancer are expected to impact patient survival. In the perspective of recurrent pandemics or alternative events requiring an intensive use of limited hospital resources, patients should be informed not to postpone care, and medical resources for patients with cancer should be sanctuarised.

AB  - Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 2 million deaths globally. Two interconnected stages of disease are generally recognised; an initial viral stage and a subsequent immune response phase with the clinical characteristics of hyperinflammation associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, many immune modulators and immunosuppressive drugs, which are widely used in rheumatological practice, have been proposed as treatments for patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. In this Review, we provide an overview of what is currently known about the efficacy and safety of antirheumatic therapies for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Dexamethasone has been shown to reduce COVID-19 related mortality, interleukin-6 inhibitors to reduce risk of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support, and baricitinib to reduce time to recovery in hospitalised patients requiring oxygen support. Further studies are needed to identify whether there is any role for glucocorticoids in patients with less severe COVID-19. Although evidence on the use of other antirheumatic drugs has suggested some benefits, results from adequately powered clinical trials are urgently needed. The heterogeneity in dosing and the absence of uniform inclusion criteria and defined stage of disease studied in many clinical trials have affected the conclusions and comparability of trial results. However, after the success of dexamethasone in proving the anti-inflammatory hypothesis, the next 12 months will undoubtedly bring further clarity about the clinical utility and optimal dose and timing of other anti-rheumatic drugs in the management of COVID-19.

AB  - The post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) is characterized by the persistence of fluctuating symptoms over three months from the onset of the possible or confirmed COVID-19 acute phase. Current data suggests that at least 10% of people with previously documented infection may develop PACS, and up to 50–80% of prevalence is reported among survivors after hospital discharge. This viewpoint will discuss various aspects of PACS, particularly in older adults, with a specific hypothesis to describe PACS as the expression of a modified aging trajectory induced by SARS CoV-2. This hypothesis will be argued from biological, clinical and public health view, addressing three main questions: (i) does SARS-CoV-2-induced alterations in aging trajectories play a role in PACS?; (ii) do people with PACS face immuno-metabolic derangements that lead to increased susceptibility to age-related diseases?; (iii) is it possible to restore the healthy aging trajectory followed by the individual before pre-COVID?. A particular focus will be given to the well-being of people with PACS that could be assessed by the intrinsic capacity model and support the definition of the healthy aging trajectory.

AB  - This analysis, using data from the Brazilian kidney transplant (KT) COVID-19 study, seeks to develop a prediction score to assist in COVID-19 risk stratification in KT recipients. In this study, 1379 patients (35 sites) were enrolled, and a machine learning approach was used to fit models in a derivation cohort. A reduced Elastic Net model was selected, and the accuracy to predict the 28-day fatality after the COVID-19 diagnosis, assessed by the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), was confirmed in a validation cohort. The better calibration values were used to build the applicable ImAgeS score. The 28-day fatality rate was 17% (n = 235), which was associated with increasing age, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, higher body mass index, dyspnea, and use of mycophenolate acid or azathioprine. Higher kidney graft function, longer time of symptoms until COVID-19 diagnosis, presence of anosmia or coryza, and use of mTOR inhibitor were associated with reduced risk of death. The coefficients of the best model were used to build the predictive score, which achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.767 (95% CI 0.698–0.834) in the validation cohort. In conclusion, the easily applicable predictive model could assist health care practitioners in identifying non-hospitalized kidney transplant patients that may require more intensive monitoring.

AB  - Background
there is concern about the increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 severe outcomes and disparity of care among patients with a psychiatric disorder (PD). Based on the Italian COVID-19 death surveillance, which collects data from all the hospitals throughout the country, we aimed to describe clinical features and care pathway of patients dying with COVID-19 and a preceding diagnosis of a PD.
Methods
in this cross-sectional study, the characteristics of a representative sample of patients, who have died with COVID-19 in Italian hospitals between February 21st and August 3rd 2020, were drawn from medical charts, described and analysed by multinomial logistic regression according to the recorded psychiatric diagnosis: no PD, severe PD (SPD) (i.e. schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, bipolar and related disorders), common mental disorder (CMD) (i.e. depression without psychotic features, anxiety disorders).
Findings
the 4020 COVID-19 deaths included in the study took place in 365 hospitals across Italy. Out of the 4020 deceased patients, 84 (2•1%) had a previous SPD, 177 (4.4%) a CMD. The mean age at death was 78.0 (95%CI 77.6–78.3) years among patients without a PD, 71.8 (95%CI 69.3–72.0) among those with an SPD, 79.5 (95%CI 78.0–81.1) in individuals with a CMD. 2253 (61.2%) patients without a PD, 62 (73.8%) with an SPD, and 136 (78.2%) with a CMD were diagnosed with three or more non-psychiatric comorbidities. When we adjusted for clinically relevant variables, including hospital of death, we found that SPD patients died at a younger age than those without a PD (adjusted OR per 1 year increment 0.96; 95% CI 0.94–0.98). Women were significantly more represented among CMD patients compared to patients without previous psychiatric history (aOR 1.56; 95% CI 1.05–2.32). Hospital admission from long-term care facilities (LTCFs) was strongly associated with having an SPD (aOR 9.02; 95% CI 4.99–16.3) or a CMD (aOR 2.09; 95% CI 1.19–3.66). Comorbidity burden, fever, admission to intensive care and time from symptoms’ onset to nasopharyngeal swab did not result significantly associated with an SPD or with a CMD in comparison to those without any PD.
Interpretation
even where equal treatment is in place, the vulnerability of patients with a PD may reduce their chance of recovering from COVID-19. The promotion of personalised therapeutic projects aimed at including people with PD in the community rather than in non-psychiatric LTCFs should be prioritised.

AB  - Summary
Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) across the Pacific region have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and emergency care (EC) clinicians have been on the frontline of response efforts. Their responsibilities have extended from triage and clinical management of patients with COVID-19 to health system leadership and coordination. This has exposed EC clinicians to a range of ethical and operational challenges. This paper describes the context and methodology of a rapid, collaborative, qualitative research project that explored the experiences of EC clinicians in Pacific LMICs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted in three phases, with data obtained from online regional EC support forums, key informant interviews and focus group discussions. A phenomenological approach was adopted, incorporating a hybrid inductive and deductive thematic analysis. Research findings, reported in other manuscripts in this collection, will inform multi-sectoral efforts to improve health system preparedness for future public health emergencies.

AB  - The extent to which power, resources, and responsibilities for public health are centralized or decentralized within a jurisdiction and how public health functions are integrated or coordinated with health care services may shape pandemic responses. However, little is known about the impacts of centralization and integration on public health system responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We examine how public health leaders perceive centralization and integration facilitated and impeded effective COVID-19 responses in three Canadian provinces. We conducted a comparative case study involving semi-structured interviews with 58 public health system leaders in three Canadian provinces with varying degrees of centralization and integration. Greater public health system centralization and integration was seen by public health leaders to facilitate more rapidly initiated and well-coordinated provincial COVID-19 responses. Decentralization may have enabled locally tailored responses in the context of limited provincial leadership. Opacity in provincial decision-making processes, jurisdictional ambiguity impacting Indigenous communities, and ineffectual public health investments were impediments across jurisdictions and thus appear to be less impacted by centralization and integration. Our study generates novel insights about potential structural facilitators and impediments of effective COVID-19 pandemic responses during the second year of the pandemic. Findings highlight key areas for future research to inform system design that support leaders to manage large-scale public health emergencies.

AB  - Background
Patients with obesity are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19. The pandemic has caused delays in preoperative preparation, progression, and completion of bariatric surgeries.
Objectives
The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on bariatric surgery patients and assess their concern of COVID-19 as they continue the preoperative process.
Setting
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Methods
A questionnaire was administered to patients to assess the impact of COVID-19 on their weight loss goals, physical activity, and diet. Time points assessed were initial bariatric consultation (T1), as well as the beginning (T2), and the end (T3) of lockdown restrictions in the region.
Results
Seventy-four participants were invited and 50 completed the survey, for a response rate of 67.6%. The average age of participants was 44.1 years. Two-thirds of patients reported significant concern that COVID-19 would affect their weight loss goals. Patients reported significant improvements in their diet from T1 to T2 (P < .01). However, at T3, some patients returned to behaviors held at T1, with snacking behaviors significantly increasing between T2 and T3 (P < .01). Physical activity decreased in 60% of patients between T2 to T3. The vast majority (90%) wanted to have their surgery as soon as possible; 56% reported low levels of concern for COVID-19 infection.
Conclusion
Bariatric patients were highly motivated to proceed with bariatric surgery despite the risks imposed by the pandemic.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 virus, the main culprit for COVID-19 disaster, has triggered a gust of curiosity both in the mechanism of action of this infection as well as potential risk factors for disease generation and regimentation. The prime focus of the present review, which is basically a narrative one, is in utilizing the current concepts of vitamin D3 as an agent with myriad functions, one of them being immunocompetence and a promising weapon for both innate and adaptive immunity against COVID-19 infection. Some of the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 virus such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) overlap with the pathophysiological effects that are overcome due to already established role of vitamin D3 e.g., amelioration of cytokine outburst. Additionally, the cardiovascular complications due to COVID-19 infection may also be connected to vitamin D3 levels and the activity of its active forms. Eventually, we summarise the clinical, observational and epidemiological data of the respiratory diseases including COVID-19 disease and try to bring its association with the potential role of vitamin D3, in particular, the activity of its active forms, circulating levels and its supplementation, against dissemination of this disease.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has been a continual challenge since 2020, and it continues to impact people and industries as a disaster caused by a biological hazard. This study examined universal health coverage (UHC) scores in relation to the performance in combating COVID-19 in the Southeast Asian region (SEAR) and the Western Pacific region (WPR), along with the State Party Self-Assessment Annual Reporting (SPAR) index under the international health regulations (IHC). The numbers of infections and deaths per million population from December 2019 to June 2022 were used as primary outcomes to measure countries’ performance. Countries with UHC scores of 63 or higher had a significantly lower number of infected patients and deaths. In addition, several inter-capacity correlations within the SPAR capacities, including with C8 (the National Health Emergency Framework), as well as a very strong correlation to C4 (Food Safety), C5 (Laboratory), and C7 (Human Resources). Furthermore, C9 (Health Service Provisions) has a very strong correlation to C1 (Legislation and Financing), C2 (International Health Regulation Coordination and a National IHR Focal Point function), and C4 (Food Safety), suggesting that the capability to manage an emerging infectious disease form blocks of capacities. In conclusion, UHC clearly mitigated the health-related consequences of COVID-19 in South-East Asia Region (SEAR) and Western Pacific Region (WPR). Investigating the correlation between the SPAR capacities and UHC is a promising approach for future research, including the importance of the provision of health services, points of entry, and, most importantly, risk communications as critical factors for managing pandemic. This study constitutes a good opportunity to apply the SPAR index to define which capacities correlate with the outcome of the pandemic in terms of infections and deaths.

AB  - In the response to COVID-19, countries have implemented response strategies along a continuum of population- and venue-level specificity ranging from suppression to mitigation strategies. Suppression strategies generally include population-wide shelter-in-place mandates or lockdowns, closure of nonessential physical venues, travel bans, testing and contact tracing, and quarantines. Sweden followed a mitigation strategy focused on risk-tailored approaches to mitigate specific acquisition risks among the elderly, minimizing the disruption to education and the delivery of other health care services, and recommendations for social distancing to minimize the disease burden. To date, Sweden has reported higher case counts and attributable mortality than other Scandinavian countries and lower than other Northern European countries. However, there are several limitations with comparison given heterogeneity in testing strategies, suspected and confirmed case definitions, and assessment of attributable mortality. The decisions in Sweden also reflect social priorities such as equity being a foundational principle of Swedish social systems. Consistently, in-person education for those aged less than 16 years continued throughout. Notably, the mitigation strategy did not eliminate the inequitable impacts of COVID-19 cases and mortality in Sweden with higher-exposure and generally lower-income occupations being associated with higher risks intersecting with these communities often residing in more dense multigenerational households. From January 1 to November 15, there has been a 1.8% increase in all-cause mortality in 2020 compared with the average of 2015-2019, representing an excess of 14.3 deaths per 100,000 population. However, the final assessment of excess deaths in Sweden in 2020 including stratification by age and integration of secular trends can only be calculated in the coming years. In response to increasing cases in the fall of 2020, Sweden has continued to leverage business-oriented regulations and public-oriented guidelines for social distancing rather than police-enforced mandates. Ultimately, pandemics present no winners. Countries have implemented a range of different COVID-19 prevention and mitigation strategies responsive to their own priorities and legal systems including equity and the balancing of competing health priorities. Given these varied approaches, countries that pursued elimination, suppression, or mitigation strategies can collaboratively learn from both successes and challenges of the different strategies to inform COVID-19 and future pandemic responses.

AB  - We failed to adequately launch a gender transformative response to COVID-19 pandemic, data by sex on a variety of indicators for most countries are hard to find. Some symptoms reported as common of COVID-19 infection, are more prominent in men, while others are more prominent in women, one cannot with certainty exclude that some of the differences observed could be due to gender bias in the management of cases in health services. The gender implications of the pandemic reach wide and far. Inequalities can be further aggravated as sex and gender intersect with other axes of inequality. The SAGER guidelines exemplify an effort to improve reporting of sex and gender dimensions and encouraging researchers to integrate these aspects in the research design. these observations and emerging evidence about the persistent gender-blind approach to COVID-19 is a wake-up call to change course. National Gender Equality Institutions can be central in ensuring gender matters are considered in government responses. COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity to reverse the trend and take action to apply an intersectional feminist approach to global health that enables a just and equal world where everyone's health and wellbeing matter.
Resumen
No se ha conseguido dar una respuesta adecuadamente transformadora desde la perspectiva de género a la pandemia de la COVID-19. Los datos por sexo en una variedad de indicadores para la mayoría de los países son difíciles de encontrar. Algunos síntomas comunes de la infección por COVID-19, son más frecuentes en los hombres, mientras que otros lo son en las mujeres, no pudiendo excluir con certeza que algunas de las diferencias observadas se deban a un sesgo de género en el manejo de los casos en los servicios de salud. Las implicaciones de género de la pandemia son amplias y de gran alcance. Las desigualdades pueden agravarse aún más cuando el sexo y el género se cruzan con otros ejes de desigualdad. Las directrices del SAGER ejemplifican un esfuerzo por mejorar la información sobre las dimensiones de sexo y género y por animar a quienes investigan a integrar estos aspectos en el diseño de la investigación. Estas observaciones y las pruebas emergentes sobre el persistente enfoque ciego al género de la COVID-19 son una llamada de atención para cambiar de rumbo. Las instituciones nacionales de igualdad de género pueden ser fundamentales para garantizar que las cuestiones de género se consideren en las respuestas gubernamentales. La pandemia de la COVID-19 es una oportunidad para invertir la tendencia y tomar medidas para aplicar un enfoque feminista interseccional en la salud global que permita un mundo justo e igualitario donde la salud y el bienestar de todos y todas importen.

AB  - Micronutrients constitute an adjuvant treatment for respiratory viral infections. Since there is no effective antiviral therapy for COVID-19 yet, adjuvant intervention for the survival of critically ill patients may be significant. Search of the PubMed, CINAHL and Cochrane databases was carried out to find human studies investigating the prognostic role of micronutrient status and the effects of micronutrient supplementation intervention in COVID-19 outcomes of adult patients. Patients with certain comorbidities (diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, renal failure, liver dysfunction etc.) or pregnant women were excluded. 31 studies (27 observational studies and 4 clinical trials) spanning the years 2020–2021, pertaining to 8624 COVID-19 patients (mean age±SD, 61 ± 9 years) were included in this systematic review. Few studies provided direct evidence on the association of serum levels of vitamin D, calcium, zinc, magnesium, phosphorus and selenium to patients' survival or death. Vitamin D and calcium were the most studied micronutrients and those with a probable promising favorable impact on patients. This review highlights the importance of a balanced nutritional status for a favorable outcome in COVID-19. Micronutrients’ deficiency on admission to hospital seems to be related to a high risk for ICU admission, intubation and even death. Nevertheless, evidence for intervention remains unclear.

AB  - Aims
The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer radiotherapy services is largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the resultant contingency plans on radiotherapy cancer services in Scotland.
Materials and methods
Detailed data of radiotherapy activity at our centre were collected from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2021. Differences in mean weekly radiotherapy courses, dose and fractionation patterns and treatment intent were compared with corresponding pre-pandemic months for all treatment sites. Qualitative data were collected for a subgroup of radical radiotherapy patients.
Results
Total radiotherapy courses decreased from 6968 to 6240 (–10%) compared with the previous year, prior to the pandemic. Average weekly radiotherapy courses delivered were 134 (standard deviation ±13), decreasing by 10% to 120 (standard deviation 15) (Welch's t-test, P < 0.001). The greatest decrease in new start treatment courses was observed from May to August 2020 (–7.7%, –24.0%, –16.7% and –18.7%) compared with the corresponding months in 2019. A significant reduction was seen for female patients <70 years (–16%) compared with females >70 years (–8%) or their male counterparts (–7% and –6%, respectively). By diagnosis, the largest reductions between pre- and post-pandemic levels were for anal (–26%), breast (–18%) and prostate (–14%) cancer. Contrarily, a significant increase was found for bladder (28%) and oesophageal (11%) cancers.
Conclusions
Over the first 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, radiotherapy activity significantly decreased compared with the 12 months prior. Due to issued guidance, the use of hypofractionated regimens increased, contributing to the reduction in treatments for some tumour sites. An increase in other tumour sites can probably be attributed to the reduction or cancellation of surgical interventions. These results will inform our understanding of the indirect consequences of the pandemic on radiotherapy services.

AB  - Starting from historic reflections, the current SARS-CoV-2 induced COVID-19 pandemic is examined from various perspectives, in terms of what it implies for the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, the modeling and monitoring of the epidemic, the development of early-warning systems, the study of mortality, prevalence estimation, diagnostic and serological testing, vaccine development, and ultimately clinical trials. Emphasis is placed on how the pandemic had led to unprecedented speed in methodological and clinical development, the pitfalls thereof, but also the opportunities that it engenders for national and international collaboration, and how it has simplified and sped up procedures. We also study the impact of the pandemic on clinical trials in other indications. We note that it has placed biostatistics, epidemiology, virology, infectiology, and vaccinology, and related fields in the spotlight in an unprecedented way, implying great opportunities, but also the need to communicate effectively, often amidst controversy.

AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and the ensuing global pandemic, has resulted in an unprecedented response to identify therapies that can limit uncontrolled inflammation observed in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. The immune pathology behind COVID-19 is complex and involves the activation and interaction of multiple systems including, but not limited to, complement, inflammasomes, endothelial as well as innate and adaptive immune cells to bring about a convoluted profile of inflammation, coagulation and tissue damage. To date, therapeutic approaches have focussed on inhibition of coagulation, untargeted immune suppression and/or cytokine-directed blocking agents. Regardless of recently achieved improvements in individual patient outcomes and survival rates, improved and focussed approaches targeting individual systems involved is needed to further improve prognosis and wellbeing. This review summarizes the current understanding of molecular and cellular systems involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, and their contribution to pathogen clearance and damage to then discuss possible therapeutic options involving immunomodulatory drug delivery systems as well as summarising the complex interplay between them.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 disrupted oral health care delivery and revealed gaps in dental public health emergency preparedness and response (PHEPR). Emerging dental PHEPR frameworks can be strengthened by means of understanding the experiences of the discipline’s frontline workers—dental safety net providers—during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
Experienced qualitative researchers interviewed dental safety net directors and clinicians (n = 21) in 6 states to understand their experiences delivering care from March 2020 through February 2021. Interview transcriptions were analyzed using iterative codes to identify major and minor themes. Conventional qualitative validity checks were used continuously to ensure impartiality and rigor.
Results
Three major themes were identified: unpredictability caused concerns among staff members and patients, while also deepening fulfilling collaborations; care delivery was guided by means of various resources that balanced safety, flexibility, and respect for autonomy; and pandemic-driven changes to oral health care delivery are timely, long-lasting, and can be somewhat fraught.
Conclusions
The human, material, and policy resources that providers used to control infections, serve vulnerable patients, maintain clinic solvency, and address provider burnout during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic can improve dental PHEPR.
Practical Implications
Dental PHEPR should address concerns beyond infection control within and between practice models, governmental agencies, and professional organizations. Examples of such concerns include, but are not limited to, guideline synchronization, materials exigencies, task shifting, and provider resilience.

KW  - Broader Value of Vaccination
KW  - meningococcal vaccination
AB  - Objectives
It is widely argued that the value of meningococcal vaccination extends beyond the narrow value elements traditionally considered in health technology assessment. Nevertheless, measuring broader value presents challenges, whereas assessment methods and outcomes vary widely. This article investigates the extent to which the broader value of meningococcal vaccination is recognized, considering the available evidence and decision maker’s methodological ability and willingness.
Methods
A targeted literature review informed the classification of broader value elements according to their relevance to meningococcal vaccination and the quality of existing evidence. Focusing on relevant value elements with good evidentiary standards, decision makers’ perspectives and methodological ability to consider them were assessed through case studies of health technology assessment of meningococcal B vaccination in England and The Netherlands.
Results
Value elements of high relevance to meningococcal vaccination with good quality evidence include caregivers’ health gains, patients’ lifetime productivity gains, and disease severity. The willingness and methodological ability to incorporate them into value assessments have been mixed. This is attributable to the scope of the value assessment perspective and the use of evaluation methods that do not fully capture broader value. For other broader value elements, evidence gaps are another potential barrier to value demonstration and recognition.
Conclusions
The current evidence base confirms that the value of meningococcal vaccination spans beyond healthcare sector effects to health-related externalities, allocative value, and societal economic benefits. To ensure that the most efficient resource allocation outcomes are achieved, countries should consider how to improve their perspective and methodological ability to assess broader value elements accurately.

AB  - The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported in December 2019 and the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was declared a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization. This sparked a plethora of investigations into diagnostics and vaccination for SARS-CoV-2, as well as treatments for COVID-19. Since COVID-19 is a severe disease associated with a high mortality, clinical trials in this disease should be monitored by a data monitoring committee (DMC), also known as data safety monitoring board (DSMB). DMCs in this indication face a number of challenges including fast recruitment requiring an unusually high frequency of safety reviews, more frequent use of complex designs and virtually no prior experience with the disease. In this paper, we provide a perspective on the work of DMCs for clinical trials of treatments for COVID-19. More specifically, we discuss organizational aspects of setting up and running DMCs for COVID-19 trials, in particular for trials with more complex designs such as platform trials or adaptive designs. Furthermore, statistical aspects of monitoring clinical trials of treatments for COVID-19 are considered. Some recommendations are made regarding the presentation of the data, stopping rules for safety monitoring and the use of external data. The proposed stopping boundaries are assessed in a simulation study motivated by clinical trials in COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
Background
COVID-19 has overwhelmed health services globally. Oral antiviral therapies are licensed worldwide, but indications and efficacy rates vary. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral favipiravir in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.
Methods
We conducted a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial of oral favipiravir in adult patients who were newly admitted to hospital with proven or suspected COVID-19 across five sites in the UK (n=2), Brazil (n=2) and Mexico (n=1). Using a permuted block design, eligible and consenting participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral favipiravir (1800 mg twice daily for 1 day; 800 mg twice daily for 9 days) plus standard care, or standard care alone. All caregivers and patients were aware of allocation and those analysing data were aware of the treatment groups. The prespecified primary outcome was the time from randomisation to recovery, censored at 28 days, which was assessed using an intention-to-treat approach. Post-hoc analyses were used to assess the efficacy of favipiravir in patients aged younger than 60 years, and in patients aged 60 years and older. The trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04373733.
Findings
Between May 5, 2020 and May 26, 2021, we assessed 503 patients for eligibility, of whom 499 were randomly assigned to favipiravir and standard care (n=251) or standard care alone (n=248). There was no significant difference between those who received favipiravir and standard care, relative to those who received standard care alone in time to recovery in the overall study population (hazard ratio [HR] 1·06 [95% CI 0·89–1·27]; n=499; p=0·52). Post-hoc analyses showed a faster rate of recovery in patients younger than 60 years who received favipiravir and standard care versus those who had standard care alone (HR 1·35 [1·06–1·72]; n=247; p=0·01). 36 serious adverse events were observed in 27 (11%) of 251 patients administered favipiravir and standard care, and 33 events were observed in 27 (11%) of 248 patients receiving standard care alone, with infectious, respiratory, and cardiovascular events being the most numerous. There was no significant between-group difference in serious adverse events per patient (p=0·87).
Interpretation
Favipiravir does not improve clinical outcomes in all patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, however, patients younger than 60 years might have a beneficial clinical response. The indiscriminate use of favipiravir globally should be cautioned, and further high-quality studies of antiviral agents, and their potential treatment combinations, are warranted in COVID-19.

AB  - Viral infections are a continuing global burden on the human population, underscored by the ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Current treatment options and supportive therapies for many viral infections are relatively limited, indicating a need for alternative therapeutic approaches. Virus-induced damage occurs through direct infection of host cells and inflammation-related changes. Severe cases of certain viral infections, including COVID-19, can lead to a hyperinflammatory response termed cytokine storm, resulting in extensive endothelial damage, thrombosis, respiratory failure, and death. Therapies targeting these complications are crucial in addition to antiviral therapies. Nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide are two endogenous gasotransmitters that have emerged as key signaling molecules with a broad range of antiviral actions in addition to having anti-inflammatory properties and protective functions in the vasculature and respiratory system. The enhancement of endogenous nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide levels thus holds promise for managing both early-stage and later-stage viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a model for similar viral infections, here we explore the current evidence regarding nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide's use to limit viral infection, resolve inflammation, and reduce vascular and pulmonary damage.

AB  - Background and aims
Molnupiravir is a newer oral antiviral drug that has recently been tested in COVID-19. We aim to conduct a systematic review of literature to find out the efficacy and safety of molnupiravir in patients with COVID-19.
Methods
We systematically searched the electronic database of PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar from inception until October 15, 2021, using MeSH keywords. Ongoing trials of molnupiravir in COVID-19 were additionally searched from the ClinicalTrials.Gov and ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials. We retrieved all the available granular details of phase 1 to 3 studies of molnupiravir in COVID-19. Subsequently we reviewed the results narratively.
Results
Two phase 1 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled (DBRPC) studies of molnupiravir showed that 1600 mg daily dose is safe and tolerable, without any serious adverse events up to 5.5 days. One phase 2 DBPRC study found significantly lower time to clearance (RNA negativity) with molnupiravir 800 mg twice daily compared to the placebo (log-rank p value = 0.013) in mild to moderate COVID-19. Interim report of one phase 3 DBRPC study in non-hospitalized COVID-19 found a significant reduction in the risk of hospital admission or death by 50% (p = 0.0012). However, no significant benefit was observed with molnupiravir in the later stage of moderate to severe COVID-19.
Conclusion
Molnupiravir is first oral antiviral drug to demonstrate a significant benefit in reducing hospitalization or death in mild COVID-19 and could be an important weapon in the battle against SARS-CoV-2. However, its role in moderate to severe COVID-19 is questionable and more studies are needed.

AB  - Objectives
To inform future policies and disaster preparedness plans in the vulnerable nursing home setting, we need greater insight into the relationship between nursing homes’ (NHs’) quality and the spread and severity of COVID-19 in NH facilities. We therefore extend current evidence on the relationships between NH quality and resident COVID-19 infection rates and deaths, taking into account NH structural characteristics and community characteristics.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Setting and Participants
15,390 Medicaid- and Medicare-certified NHs.
Methods
We obtained and merged the following data sets: (1) COVID-19 weekly data reported by each nursing home to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Healthcare Safety Network, (2) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Five Star Quality Rating System, (3) county-level COVID-19 case counts, (4) county-level population data, and (5) county-level sociodemographic data.
Results
Among 1-star NHs, there were an average of 13.19 cases and 2.42 deaths per 1000 residents per week between May 25 and December 20, 2020. Among 5-star NHs, there were an average of 9.99 cases and 1.83 deaths per 1000 residents per week. The rate of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was 31% higher among 1-star NHs compared with 5-star NHs [model 1: incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-1.39], and the rate of COVID-19 deaths was 30% higher (IRR 1.30, 95% CI 1.20, 1.41). These associations were only partially explained by differences in community spread of COVID-19, case mix, and the for-profit status and size of NHs.
Conclusions and Implications
We found that COVID-19 case and death rates were substantially higher among NHs with lower star ratings, suggesting that NHs with quality much below average are more susceptible to the spread of COVID-19. This relationship, particularly with regard to case rates, can be partially attributed to external factors: lower-rated NHs are often located in areas with greater COVID-19 community spread and serve more socioeconomically vulnerable residents than higher-rated NHs.

AB  - Background
The Chinese elderly face a significant threat from seasonal influenza, owing to the consistently low vaccination coverage. This study investigated the prevalence and determinants of influenza vaccination hesitancy among the Chinese elderly.
Methods
In 2019, 3849 elderly individuals from 10 provinces in China were recruited in a cross-sectional survey. Multinomial logistic regression was applied to investigate the determinants of influenza vaccination hesitancy.
Results
Among the elderly respondents, 37.18% expressed some degree of hesitancy towards influenza vaccination: 19.28% were hesitant, and 17.90% refused influenza vaccination, including 19.28% acceptors with doubts and 17.90% refusers. Only 39.10% of the respondents considered themselves as the priority group for influenza vaccination, and 13.93% reported receiving a recommendation for vaccination from healthcare workers. Respondents with higher education levels and from urban areas had significantly higher odds of vaccine hesitancy than their counterparts. Confidence in the safety of vaccines was negatively associated with vaccine hesitancy, but confidence in vaccine efficacy had no such association. Respondents who perceived themselves as highly susceptible to influenza (AOR = 0.85; 95 %CI = 0.77–0.93) and those aware of the elderly as a priority group for influenza vaccination (AOR = 0.51; 95 %CI = 0.41–0.64) had a significantly lower odds of being refusers.
Conclusion
This study found a high prevalence of hesitancy towards influenza vaccination among the Chinese elderly, especially well-educated and urban-dwelling respondents. The government should address vaccine hesitancy through culturally appropriate communication, subsidies for vaccination, and actively promoting vaccines through primary care professionals.

AB  - Selenium is an indispensable trace element for all living organisms. It is an essential structural component of several selenium-dependent enzymes, which support the human body’s defense mechanism. Recently, the significance of selenium in preventing/treating COVID-19 has been documented in the literature. This review highlights the clinical studies, compositions, and patent literature on selenium to prevent/treat COVID-19. Selenium exerts its anti-COVID-19 action by reducing oxidative stress, declining the expression of the ACE-2 receptor, lowering the discharge of pro-inflammatory substances, and inhibiting the 3CLPro (main protease) and PLpro enzyme of SARS-CoV-2. The data of clinical studies, inventive compositions, and patent literature revealed that selenium monotherapy and its compositions with other nutritional supplements/drugs (vitamin, iron, zinc, copper, ferulic acid, resveratrol, spirulina, N-acetylcysteine, fish oil, many herbs, doxycycline, azithromycin, curcumin, quercetin, etc.,) might be practical to prevent/treat COVID-19. The studies have also suggested a correlation between COVID-19 and selenium deficiency. This indicates that adequate selenium supplementation may provide promising treatment outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The authors foresee the development and commercialization of Selenium-based compositions and dosage forms (spray, inhalers, control release dosage forms, etc.) to battle COVID-19. We also trust that numerous selenium-based compositions are yet to be explored. Accordingly, there is good scope for scientists to work on developing novel and inventive selenium-based compositions to fight against COVID-19. However, there is also a need to consider the narrow therapeutic window and chemical interaction of selenium before developing selenium-based compositions.

AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial morbidity and mortality to humanity. Remarkable progress has been made in understanding both the innate and adaptive mechanisms involved in the host response to the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus, but much remains to be discovered. Robust upper airway defenses are critical in restricting SARS-CoV-2 replication and propagation. Further, the nasal abundance of viral uptake receptor, ACE2, and the host epithelial transcriptional landscape, are associated with differential disease outcomes across different patient cohorts. The adaptive host response to systemic COVID-19 is heterogeneous and complex. Blunted responses to interferon and robust cytokine generation are hallmarks of the disease, particularly at the advanced stages. Excessive immune cell influx into tissues can lead to substantial collateral damage to the host akin to sepsis. This review offers a contemporary summary of these mechanisms of disease and highlights potential avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic development. These include improved disease stratification, targeting effectors of immune-mediated tissue damage, and blunting of immune cell-mediated tissue damage.

AB  - Summary
Background
A key unresolved controversy in severe COVID-19 pneumonitis in pregnancy is the optimum timing of delivery and whether delivery improves or worsens maternal outcomes. We aimed to assess clinical data on every intensive care unit (ICU) day for pregnant and postpartum women admitted to the ICU with COVID-19, with a particular focus on the days preceding and following delivery.
Methods
In this multicentre, nationwide, prospective and retrospective cohort study, we evaluated all pregnant women who were admitted to an ICU in Israel with severe COVID-19 pneumonitis from the 13th week of gestation to the 1st week postpartum. We excluded pregnant patients in which the ICU admission was unrelated to severe COVID-19 pneumonitis. We assessed maternal and neonatal outcomes and longitudinal clinical and laboratory ICU data. The primary overall outcome was maternal outcome (worst of the following: no invasive positive pressure ventilation [IPPV], use of IPPV, use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO], or death). The primary longitudinal outcome was Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and the secondary longitudinal outcome was the novel PORCH (positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP], oxygenation, respiratory support, chest x-ray, haemodynamic support) score. Patients were classified into four groups: no-delivery (pregnant at admission and no delivery during the ICU stay), postpartum (ICU admission ≥1 day after delivery), delivery-critical (pregnant at admission and receiving or at high risk of requiring IPPV at the time of delivery), or delivery-non-critical (pregnant at admission and not critically ill at the time of delivery).
Findings
From Feb 1, 2020, to Jan 31, 2022, 84 patients were analysed: 34 patients in the no-delivery group, four in postpartum, 32 in delivery-critical, and 14 in delivery-non-critical. The delivery-critical and postpartum groups had worse outcomes than the other groups: 26 (81%) of 32 patients in the delivery-critical group and four (100%) of four patients in the postpartum group required IPPV; 12 (38%) and three (75%) patients required ECMO, and one (3%) and two (50%) patients died, respectively. The delivery-non-critical and no-delivery groups had far better outcomes than other groups: six (18%) of 34 patients and two (14%) of 14 patients required IPPV, respectively; no patients required ECMO or died. Oxygen saturation (SpO2), SpO2 to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio (S/F ratio), partial pressure of arterial oxygen to FiO2 ratio (P/F ratio), ROX index (S/F ratio divided by respiratory rate), and SOFA and PORCH scores were all highly predictive for adverse maternal outcome (p<0·0001). The delivery-critical group deteriorated on the day of delivery, continued to deteriorate throughout the ICU stay, and took longer to recover (ICU duration, Mantel-Cox p<0·0001), whereas the delivery-non-critical group improved rapidly following delivery. The day of delivery was a significant covariate for PORCH (p<0·0001) but not SOFA (p=0·09) scores.
Interpretation
In patients who underwent delivery during their ICU stay, maternal outcome deteriorated following delivery among those defined as critical compared with non-critical patients, who improved following delivery. Interventional delivery should be considered for maternal indications before patients deteriorate and require mechanical ventilation.
Funding
None.

AB  - Background
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common, life‐threatening complication of COVID‐19 infection. COVID‐19 risk‐prediction models include a history of VTE. However, it is unclear whether remote history (>9 years previously) of VTE also confers increased risk of COVID‐19.
Objectives
To investigate possible association between VTE and COVID‐19 severity, independent of other risk factors.
Methods
Cohort study of UK Biobank participants recruited between 2006 and 2010. Baseline data, including history of VTE, were linked to COVID‐19 test results, COVID‐19‐related hospital admissions, and COVID‐19 deaths. The risk of COVID‐19 hospitalization or death was compared for participants with a remote history VTE versus without. Poisson regression models were run univariately then adjusted stepwise for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and comorbid covariates.
Results
After adjustment for sociodemographic and lifestyle confounders and comorbid conditions, remote history of VTE was associated with nonfatal community (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.02–2.54, p= .039), nonfatal hospitalized (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.06–2.17, p= .024) and severe (hospitalized or fatal) (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.04–1.89, p= .025) COVID‐19. Associations with remote history of VTE were stronger among men (severe COVID‐19: RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.14–2.42, p= .009) than for women (severe COVID‐19: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.66–1.74, p= .786).
Conclusion
Our findings support inclusion of remote history of VTE in COVID‐19 risk‐prediction scores, and consideration of sex‐specific risk scores.

AB  - The mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were brought to market in response to the public health crises of Covid-19. The utilization of mRNA vaccines in the context of infectious disease has no precedent. The many alterations in the vaccine mRNA hide the mRNA from cellular defenses and promote a longer biological half-life and high production of spike protein. However, the immune response to the vaccine is very different from that to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this paper, we present evidence that vaccination induces a profound impairment in type I interferon signaling, which has diverse adverse consequences to human health. Immune cells that have taken up the vaccine nanoparticles release into circulation large numbers of exosomes containing spike protein along with critical microRNAs that induce a signaling response in recipient cells at distant sites. We also identify potential profound disturbances in regulatory control of protein synthesis and cancer surveillance. These disturbances potentially have a causal link to neurodegenerative disease, myocarditis, immune thrombocytopenia, Bell's palsy, liver disease, impaired adaptive immunity, impaired DNA damage response and tumorigenesis. We show evidence from the VAERS database supporting our hypothesis. We believe a comprehensive risk/benefit assessment of the mRNA vaccines questions them as positive contributors to public health.

AB  - Background
This study aimed to estimate potential undetected cancers over the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic in Catalonia.
Methods
Cancer incidence was compared between pre-pandemic (2019) and pandemic (March 2020-January 2022) periods in the Catalan Pathology Registry (CPR) according to sex, age, and tumor site. The correlation between cancer diagnosis and COVID-19 health care workload was also evaluated by means of the Pearson's correlation coefficient (R). The expected incident cancers (E) during the pandemic were estimated by applying 2019 CPR cancer incidence specific rates by sex and 5-year age groups to the 2020 and 2021 Catalan population pyramids. CPR incident cancers were considered observed (O). Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the O/E ratio.
Results
After two pandemic years, cancer diagnosis decreased by 12% (SIR 0.88, 95% CI 0.87-0.89), or ∼7700 undetected cancers (13 000 with nonmelanoma skin cancer). Without nonmelanoma skin cancer, 72% of the cancer underdiagnosis was generated in 2020. Diagnoses decreased more in men (whole pandemic −14%; 2020 −21%; 2021 −8%) than in women (−9%, −19%, −3%, respectively), dropping significantly overall in all pandemic waves but the fifth (first −37%, second −16%, third −8%, fourth −6%, fifth −2%, sixth −6%), and across all adult age groups. In the first wave, CPR cancer diagnosis was inversely correlated with COVID-19 caseload in primary care (R −0.91, 95% CI −0.97 to −0.75) and occupancy in conventional hospital wards (R −0.91, 95% CI −0.99 to −0.48) and intensive care (R −0.91, 95% CI 95% −0.98 to −0.70).
Conclusions
Our study evaluated the overall pandemic impact on cancer diagnosis on a large scale and with minimal selection bias, showing that as of February 2022, cancer detection in Catalonia had not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Pending cancer incidence data from population-based cancer registries, early CPR data could inform the development of Spanish cancer control plans.

AB  - In late 2019, a new respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, China. It was highly infectious and spread worldwide. It was caused by a new coronavirus; SARS-2 and was named Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19. It reached the United States in early 2020. COVID is especially lethal for the elderly and within a year, over half a million victims had died in the United States. Attempts to control the spread by social distancing and mask wearing were unevenly applied and some places suffered more than others. Economic considerations affected the degree to which social distancing rules were enforced. The disease occurred in waves reaching its greatest prevalence in December–January of 2020–21. Fortunately, effective vaccines were developed rapidly, and mass vaccination began in January 2021. As a result, the number of new cases dropped rapidly and social restrictions were gradually restricted. The disease has not disappeared and will likely remain a common respiratory infection.

AB  - Numerous reviews have summarized the epidemiology, pathophysiology and the various therapeutic aspects of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but a practical guide on “how to treat whom with what and when” based on an understanding of the immunological background of the disease stages remains missing. This review attempts to combine the current knowledge about the immunopathology of COVID-19 with published evidence of available and emerging treatment options. We recognize that the information about COVID-19 and its treatment is rapidly changing, but hope that this guide offers those on the frontline of this pandemic an understanding of the host response in COVID-19 patients and supports their ongoing efforts to select the best treatments tailored to their patient's clinical status.

AB  - Given the scarcity of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, a chief policy question is how to allocate them among different sociodemographic groups. This paper evaluates COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies proposed to date, focusing on their stated goals; the mechanisms through which the selected allocations affect the course and burden of the pandemic; and the main epidemiological, economic, logistical, and political issues that arise when setting the prioritization strategy. The paper uses a simple, age-stratified susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered model applied to the United States to quantitatively assess the performance of alternative prioritization strategies with respect to avoided deaths, avoided infections, and life-years gained. We demonstrate that prioritizing essential workers is a viable strategy for reducing the number of cases and years of life lost, while the largest reduction in deaths is achieved by prioritizing older adults in most scenarios, even if the vaccine is effective at blocking viral transmission. Uncertainty regarding this property and potential delays in dose delivery reinforce the call for prioritizing older adults. Additionally, we investigate the strength of the equity motive that would support an allocation strategy attaching absolute priority to essential workers for a vaccine that reduces infection-fatality risk.

AB  - Background
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognizes that older adults and individuals with certain medical conditions are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Understanding the proportion of the population at risk of severe infection, including among those with heart disease, could assist current vaccine strategy efforts.
Methods
Using data from the 2015-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we estimated the weighted prevalence of any of eight of eleven increased-risk conditions (including age ≥65) in U.S. adults aged ≥18 (N = 10,581) and extrapolated these results to a population of 233.8 million U.S. adults ≥18, and subgroups from the overall population defined by race/ethnicity, education, income and history of heart disease.
Results
An estimated 176.1 million individuals representing 75.4% of U.S. adults had at least one increased-risk condition, 40.3% ≥2 and, 18.5% ≥3 conditions. Approximately 129 million adults aged <65 (69.2%) were also estimated to be at increased-risk. Compared to Whites, similar proportions of Blacks in the overall population (78.0 vs. 75.6%, p>0.05) and Hispanics in the younger population (70.8 vs 68.4%) were estimated to be at increased-risk. Conversely, a greater proportion of individuals with lower education and income levels were estimated to be at increased-risk both in the overall and younger population. In addition, an estimated 6.2 million individuals (14.5%) had heart disease. Among these, virtually all had at least one additional CDC risk factor (97.9%) and most had ≥2 or ≥3 risk factors (83.8% and 58.5%, respectively).
Conclusions
As vaccination strategies are being explored, these results demonstrate that >75% of adults in the U.S. would be considered at increased-risk for severe COVID-19 infection by CDC criteria. Risk factor prevalence alone may not adequately capture the totality of risk, particularly among Black and Hispanic racial/ethnic groups and those with heart disease.

AB  - Summary
Immunocompromised individuals and particularly those with hematologic malignancies are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity and mortality due to immunologic deficits that limit prevention, treatment, and clearance of the virus. Understanding the natural history of viral infections in people with impaired immunity due to underlying conditions, immunosuppressive therapy, or a combination thereof has emerged as a critical area of investigation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies focused on these individuals have provided key insights into aspects of innate and adaptive immunity underlying both the antiviral immune response and excess inflammation in the setting of COVID-19. This review presents what is known about distinct states of immunologic vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 and how this information can be harnessed to improve prevention and treatment strategies for immunologically high-risk populations.

AB  - Introduction
Despite seasonal influenza vaccination programmes in most countries targeting individuals aged ≥ 65 (or ≥ 55) years and high risk-groups, significant disease burden remains. We explored the impact and cost-effectiveness of 27 vaccination programmes targeting the elderly and/or children in eight European settings (n = 205.8 million).
Methods
We used an age-structured dynamic-transmission model to infer age- and (sub-)type-specific seasonal influenza virus infections calibrated to England, France, Ireland, Navarra, The Netherlands, Portugal, Scotland, and Spain between 2010/11 and 2017/18. The base-case vaccination scenario consisted of non-adjuvanted, non-high dose trivalent vaccines (TV) and no universal paediatric vaccination. We explored i) moving the elderly to “improved” (i.e., adjuvanted or high-dose) trivalent vaccines (iTV) or non-adjuvanted non-high-dose quadrivalent vaccines (QV); ii) adopting mass paediatric vaccination with TV or QV; and iii) combining the elderly and paediatric strategies. We estimated setting-specific costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained from the healthcare perspective, and discounted QALYs at 3.0%.
Results
In the elderly, the estimated numbers of infection per 100,000 population are reduced by a median of 261.5 (range across settings: 154.4, 475.7) when moving the elderly to iTV and by 150.8 (77.6, 262.3) when moving them to QV. Through indirect protection, adopting mass paediatric programmes with 25% uptake achieves similar reductions in the elderly of 233.6 using TV (range: 58.9, 425.6) or 266.5 using QV (65.7, 477.9), with substantial health gains from averted infections across ages. At €35,000/QALY gained, moving the elderly to iTV plus adopting mass paediatric QV programmes provides the highest mean net benefits and probabilities of being cost-effective in all settings and paediatric coverage levels.
Conclusion
Given the direct and indirect protection, and depending on the vaccine prices, model results support a combination of having moved the elderly to an improved vaccine and adopting universal paediatric vaccination programmes across the European settings.
