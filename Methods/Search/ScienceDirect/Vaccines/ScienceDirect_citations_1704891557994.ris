AB  - We analyze the medium-term macroeconomic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lock-down measures on low-income countries. We focus on the impact of the degradation of health and human capital caused by the pandemic and its aftermath, exploring the trade-offs between rebuilding human capital and the recovery of livelihoods and macroeconomic sustainability. A dynamic general equilibrium model is calibrated to reflect the structural characteristics of vulnerable low-income countries and to replicate key dimensions of the Covid-19 shock. We show that absent significant and sustained external financing, the persistence of loss-of-learning effects on labor productivity is likely to make the post-Covid recovery more attenuated and more expensive than many contemporary analysis suggests.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - a novel coronavirus has rapid spread, and caused community infection around the globe. During the absence of a vaccine, people focused more on an immunity-boosting diet and needed clear knowledge about immunity-boosting foods. However, after the vaccination drive, the importance of food as a natural source of immunomodulation cannot be neglected. So, the purpose of this review was to describe the role of vital nutrient in boosting immune system of body apart from other factors like adequate sleep, exercise, and low stress levels. Macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, B-cells, and T-cells are the important components having important role in maintaining immunity of the human body. The first four-act as the initial mediators of innate host defense, and the latter two produce antibodies for pathogen destruction. The review investigated vital nutrients like vitamin-C, A, E and D, iron, zinc, folic acid, probiotics, and prebiotics affecting these immune components in some extent. Fruits, vegetables, spices, herbs, seeds, nuts, cereals, millets, and superfoods like chlorella and spirulina are good sources of these nutrients. However, fortified foods, functional foods, encapsulated foods with bioactive compounds and plant-based foods have shown immense potential in boosting immunity against viral infections like COVID-19. Some clinical trials and retrospective cohort studies have shown reduction in the severity of COVID-19 patients with relation to plant-based diet, vitamin D and C doses, probiotic, and zinc salts application.

AB  - We overcome a lack of frontline worker status information in most COVID-19 data repositories to document the extent to which occupation has contributed to COVID-19 disparities in the United States. Using national data from over a million U.S. respondents to a Facebook-Carnegie Mellon University survey administered from September 2020 to March 2021, we estimated the likelihoods of frontline workers, compared to non-frontline workers, 1) to ever test positive for SARs-Cov-2 and 2) to test positive for SARs-Cov-2 within the past two weeks. Net of other covariates including education level, county-level political environment, and rural residence, both healthcare and non-healthcare frontline workers had higher odds of having ever tested positive for SARs-Cov-2 across the study time period. Similarly, non-healthcare frontline workers were more likely to test positive in the previous 14 days. Conversely, healthcare frontline workers were less likely to have recently tested positive. Our findings suggest that occupational exposure has played an independent role in the uneven spread of the virus. In particular, non-healthcare frontline workers have experienced sustained higher risk of testing positive for SARs-Cov-2 compared to non-frontline workers. Alongside more worker protections, future COVID-19 and other highly infectious disease response strategies must be augmented by a more robust recognition of the role that structural factors, such as the highly stratified U.S. occupational landscape, have played in the uneven toll of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The Nordic Paradox of inequality describes how the Nordic countries have puzzlingly high levels of relative health inequalities compared to other nations, despite extensive universal welfare systems and progressive tax regimes that redistribute income. However, the veracity and origins of this paradox have been contested across decades of literature, as many scholars argue it relates to measurement issues or historical coincidences. Disentangling between potential explanations is crucial to determine if widespread adoption of the Nordic model could represent a sufficient panacea for lowering health inequalities, or if new approaches must be pioneered. As newfound challenges to welfare systems continue to emerge, evidence describing the benefits of welfare systems is becoming ever more important. Preliminary evidence indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic is drastically exacerbating social inequalities in health across the world, via direct and indirect effects. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic therefore represents a unique opportunity to measure the value of welfare systems in insulating their populations from rising social inequalities in health. However, COVID-19 has also created new measurement challenges and interrupted data collection mechanisms. Robust academic studies will therefore be needed—drawing on novel data collection methods—to measure increasing social inequalities in health in a timely fashion. In order to assure that policies implemented to reduce inequalities can be guided by accurate and updated information, policymakers, academics, and the international community must work together to ensure streamlined data collection, reporting, analysis, and evidence-based decision-making. In this way, the pandemic may offer the opportunity to finally clarify some of the mechanisms underpinning the Nordic Paradox, and potentially more firmly establish the merits of the Nordic model as a global example for reducing social inequalities in health.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread attention given to the notions of “flattening the curve” during lockdowns, and successful contact tracing programs suppressing outbreaks. However a more nuanced picture of these interventions’ effects on epidemic trajectories is necessary. By mathematical modeling each as reactive quarantine measures, dependent on current infection rates, with different mechanisms of action, we analytically derive distinct nonlinear effects of these interventions on final and peak outbreak size. We simultaneously fit the model to provincial reported case and aggregated quarantined contact data from China. Lockdowns compressed the outbreak in China inversely proportional to population quarantine rates, revealing their critical dependence on timing. Contact tracing had significantly less impact on final outbreak size, but did lead to peak size reduction. Our analysis suggests that altering the cumulative cases in a rapidly spreading outbreak requires sustained interventions that decrease the reproduction number close to one, otherwise some type of swift lockdown measure may be needed.

AB  - Objectives
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a potentially severe complication of COVID-19 most commonly resulting in respiratory failure. This ten-patient study was designed to determine the efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in improving oxygenation and in reducing the cytokine load in a critically ill subset of patients.
Methods
Five single volume plasma exchanges over eight days within a 14-day study period. In mechanically ventilated patients, oxygenation was measured via the PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio and the oxygenation index (OI) daily for 14 days. Supplemental oxygen requirements were tracked daily for non-ventilated patients.
Results
Non-ventilated patients were liberated from supplemental oxygen after TPE. The response was rapid with an 87% average reduction in oxygenation requirements following and average time to return to room air of 5.25 days. All mechanically ventilated patients demonstrated improvement in oxygenation with a 78% average improvement in the P/F ratio and a 43% improvement in OI. C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNFα, IFNγ and GM-CSF, were measured daily with immediate post TPE levels drawn on days 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. All patients demonstrated significant reductions in CRP, IL-6, IL-10 and TNFα.
Conclusions
In the majority of patients with Penn class 3 and 4 CRS complicating COVID-19, TPE demonstrated a prompt improvement in oxygenation and reduction in cytokine load without compromising patient safety. As this pilot study was envisioned to be hypothesis generating, expanded trials using TPE alone and in conjunction with novel pharmacologic agents are warranted.

Metabolomics has great potential in discovering biochemical pathways and pathway interactions, disease diagnosis, and biomarker discovery. Viral infections induce changes in the host cell metabolism resulting in cellular reprogramming. In COVID-19, the dysregulation of host metabolites has been implemented in various aspects including diagnosis and management. This chapter summarizes various applications of metabolites and metabolomics approaches in COVID-19.

AB  - This review on COVID-19 immunotherapy enables a comparative analysis of the short-list of currently approved major vaccines. These include the Pfizer and Moderna first mRNA vaccines under FDA purview and the Oxford/AstraZeneca simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine (under UK-MHPRA guidance), all produced in record time, being safe and effective. The Pfizer and Moderna double dose vaccines have the clear edge in treatment efficacy, being in the 90% range compared to AstraZeneca in the average 70%. However, the AZ double dose vaccine has significant advantages with respect to lower cost and stability in storage. We enumerate several potential advances in the technology of the manufacturers: (1) combination vaccines such as testing AstraZeneca’s product with a component of the Russian’s Sputnik V to achieve durable immunity; (2) the potential for single dose vaccines coming on-line, and with Johnson & Johnson/Janssen; and (3) the need for refined thermotolerant formulations obviating the need for cold storage. As an adjunct to vaccinotherapy, affinity adsorption column technology is another facet recruited in the processing of corona convalescent plasma/cryosupernatant to concentrate neutralizing antibodies against the virus. Clinical trials, to date, of infected patients have been indeterminate as to whether plasmapheresis-based products are effective or not. This is due to the failure to standardize the composition of the plasma derived component, ambiguous clinical indications for use in human subjects, and inconsistent timing of administration in the course of the infection. Known T-cell lymphopenia, which is attendant to progressive viral infection and immune driven inflammation, may be a quantitative surrogate biological marker as to when to start treatment. This is not only for initiating plasmapheresis-based therapeutics but also the judicious selection of ancillary pharmaceuticals, ie. monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins and anti-viral drugs.

AB  - Since the first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019, it is now recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) as more than 200 countries and territories worldwide are affected with an increasing incidence. The SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a spectrum of non-specific signs and symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic infection, to flu-like illness such as fever, cough, dry cough and fatigue, to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even multi-organ failures with high morbidity and mortality. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets that infected people exhale during incubation and onset period. By 12 June 2020, over 7.5 million confirmed cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with more than 421,000 deaths in the world have been reported to the WHO. No specific medication is approved to treat COVID-19, raising the urgent need for antiviral drug development. By 12 June 2020, there are over 1000 clinical trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov for treatment of COVID-19. This review summarizes the epidemiology, virology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and particularly the antiviral drugs currently under clinical trials for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, together with the challenges and perspectives of this disease are also discussed.

AB  - On January 2020, WHO confirmed the epidemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 as a Health Emergency of International Concern. The aim of this meta-meta-analysis is quantifying meta-analytic findings on the association of cardiovascular disease (CVD) comorbidities and COVID-19 severity. Findings suggest that chances of getting severe COVID-19 disease in patients with CVD is greater than those without CVD. Also, prevalence of CVD in patents with COVID-19 is 0.08 (95% CI = 0.07–0.08). The OR as 3.44 indicates that the odds of getting severe COVID-19 is more than 3 times higher in those with CVD. Also, prevalence of hypertension in patient with COVID-19 is 0.27 (95%CI = 0.27–0.28) and the OR as 2.68 indicates that the odds of getting severe COVID-19 in cases with high blood pressure is more than 2.5 times higher than those without hypertension. It is rational to suppose that persons with coronary artery disease are prone to severe viral infection thereby, guideline-directed diagnosis and medical therapy is vital in CVD patients.

Notably, older age or preexisting comorbidities like cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, cancer, and diabetes increase the risk of more severe disease manifestations and fatalities. The co-morbid conditions in COVID patients also include chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, characterized by preexisting long-term, persistent inflammation due to aberrant activation of immune system, which may be organ specific or systemic in nature. This review explores how the preexisting systemic immune activation might pose a greater risk of developing severe disease phenotype in case of the possible coincidence of COVID-19 and chronic inflammatory disorders.

AB  - This work attempts to shed light on whether the COVID-19 pandemic rides on airborne pollution. In particular, a two-city study provides evidence that PM2.5 contributes to the timing and severity of the epidemic, without adjustment for confounders. The publicly available data of deaths between March and October 2020, updated it on May 30, 2021, and the average seasonal concentrations of PM2.5 pollution over the previous years in Thessaloniki, the second-largest city of Greece, were investigated. It was found that changes in coronavirus-related deaths follow changes in air pollution and that the correlation between the two data sets is maximized at the lag time of one month. Similar data from Tehran were gathered for comparison. The results of this study underscore that it is possible, if not likely, that pollution nanoparticles are related to COVID-19 fatalities (Granger causality, p < 0.05), contributing to the understanding of the environmental impact on pandemics.

AB  - Background
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) triggers the development of numerous pathologies and infection-linked complications and exacerbates existing pathologies in nearly all body systems. Aside from the primarily targeted respiratory organs, adverse SARS-CoV-2 effects were observed in nervous, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/metabolic, immune, and other systems in COVID-19 survivors. Long-term effects of this viral infection have been recently observed and represent distressing sequelae recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a distinct clinical entity defined as post-COVID-19 condition. Considering the pandemic is still ongoing, more time is required to confirm post COVID-19 condition diagnosis in the COVID-19 infected cohorts, although many reported post COVID-19 symptoms overlap with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).
Aims of Review
In this study, COVID-19 clinical presentation and associated post-infection sequelae (post-COVID-19 condition) were reviewed and compared with ME/CFS symptomatology.
Key Scientific Concepts of Review
The onset, progression, and symptom profile of post COVID-19 condition patients have considerable overlap with ME/CFS. Considering the large scope and range of pro-inflammatory effects of this virus, it is reasonable to expect development of post COVID-19 clinical complications in a proportion of the affected population. There are reports of a later debilitating syndrome onset three months post COVID-19 infection (often described as long-COVID-19), marked by the presence of fatigue, headache, cognitive dysfunction, post-exertional malaise, orthostatic intolerance, and dyspnoea. Acute inflammation, oxidative stress, and increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Longitudinal monitoring of post COVID-19 patients is warranted to understand the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pathomechanism of post COVID-19 condition.

AB  - Post COVID-19 vaccine development, nations are now getting ready to face another challenge: how to effectively distribute vaccines amongst the masses to quickly achieve herd immunity against the infection. According to some experts, herd immunity for COVID-19 can be achieved by inoculating 67% of the population. India may find it difficult to achieve this service level target, owing to several infrastructural deficiencies in its vaccine supply chain. Effect of these deficiencies is to cause frequent lead time disruptions. In this context, we develop a novel modelling approach to identify few nodes, which require additional inventory allocations (strategic inventory reserves) to ensure minimum service level (67%) under the possibility of lead time disruptions. Later, through an illustrative case study on distribution of Japanese Encephalitis vaccine, we identify conditions under which strategic inventory reserve policy cannot be practically implemented to meet service level targets. Nodes fulfilling these conditions are termed as critical nodes and must be overhauled structurally to make the implementation of strategic inventory policy practically viable again. Structural overhauling may entail installation of better cold storage facilities, purchasing more quality transport vans, improving reliability of transport network, and skills of cold storage manager by training. Ideally, conditions for identifying critical nodes for COVID-19 vaccine distribution must be derived separately by substituting COVID-19 specific parametric values in our model. In the absence of the required data for COVID-19 scenario, JE specific criteria can be used heuristically to identify critical nodes and structurally overhaul them later for efficiently achieving service level targets.

AB  - While COVID-19, the disease driven by SARS-CoV-2 has ignited interest in the host immune response to this infection, it has also highlighted the lack of treatment options for the damaging inflammatory responses driven by pathogens that precipitate the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). With the global prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the likelihood of a second winter spike alongside seasonal flu, the need for effective and targeted anti-inflammatory agents is even more pressing. Here we discuss the aetiology of COVID-19 and the common signalling pathways driven by SARS-CoV-2, namely p38 MAP kinase. We highlight that p38 MAP kinase becomes elevated with increasing age, thereby driving many of the inflammatory pathways that precipitate death in old people with the added drawback of impairing vaccine efficacy in this susceptible age group. Finally, we review drugs available to inhibit p38 MAP kinase, their risks-versus-benefits as well as suggested dosing regimen to combat over-exuberant innate immune responses and potentially reverse vaccine inefficacy in older patients.

AB  - Currently, the world is facing a Coronavirus pandemic with a grave deficiency of specific therapy for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). Moreover, scientists attempt to discover the most refined approach to prevent this condition. Regarding COVID-19 infection, herbal medicines with immunomodulatory effects may offer patients a promising preventive treatment option. Several ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are effective during this worrisome Coronavirus pandemic i.e. Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers, Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal, Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Curcuma longa L. etc. TCM was shown to be utilized with over 90% efficacy when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in early 2020. In addition to herbal treatments and nutraceutical drugs, dietary supplements such as vitamins and amino acid derivatives also play a significant part in COVID-19 management. Diet can assist in regulating inflammation, while nutraceuticals can aid in the prevention of viral invasion. Functional amino acids (e.g., arginine, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, taurine, and tryptophan) and glutathione, which are all abundant in animal-sourced foodstuffs, are crucial for optimum immunity and health in humans and animals. The goal of this article is to thoroughly evaluate recent statistics on the effectiveness of herbal medicines in COVID-19, the antiviral activity of nutraceuticals, and the significance of these results in creating dietary supplements that would enhance innate immunity and contribute as preventive measures against severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

AB  - To mitigate the harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, world countries have resorted – though with different timing and intensities – to a range of interventions. These interventions and their relaxation have shaped the epidemic into a multi-phase form, namely an early invasion phase often followed by a lockdown phase, whose unlocking triggered a second epidemic wave, and so on. In this article, we provide a kinematic description of an epidemic whose time course is subdivided by mitigation interventions into a sequence of phases, on the assumption that interventions are effective enough to prevent the susceptible proportion to largely depart from 100% (or from any other relevant level). By applying this hypothesis to a general SIR epidemic model with age-since-infection and piece-wise constant contact and recovery rates, we supply a unified treatment of this multi-phase epidemic showing how the different phases unfold over time. Subsequently, by exploiting a wide class of infectiousness and recovery kernels allowing reducibility (either to ordinary or delayed differential equations), we investigate in depth a low-dimensional case allowing a non-trivial full analytical treatment also of the transient dynamics connecting the different phases of the epidemic. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results by a fit to the overall Italian COVID-19 epidemic since March 2020 till February 2021 i.e., before the mass vaccination campaign. This show the abilities of the proposed model in effectively describing the entire course of an observed multi-phasic epidemic with a minimal set of data and parameters, and in providing useful insight on a number of aspects including e.g., the inertial phenomena surrounding the switch between different phases.

AB  - Objectives
To better understand the impact of comprehensive COVID-19 targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on influenza burden worldwide.
Methods
We conducted a systematic literature search in selected databases (PubMed, WHO COVID-19), preprint servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv) and websites of European Public Health institutes. Documents that compared influenza estimates in the 2019/2020 season with previous seasons were included. Information synthesis was qualitative due to a high heterogeneity in the number and periods of comparative seasons, outcome measures and statistical methods.
Results
We included 23 records reporting from 15 countries/regions as well as 8 reports from European Public Health agencies. Estimates in the 2019/2020 season based on influenza virus tests (4 out of 7 countries/regions), defined influenza cases (8 out of 9), influenza positivity rate (7 out of 8), and severe complications (1 out of 2) were lower than in former seasons. Results from syndromic indicators, such as influenza-like-illness (ILI), were less clear or even raised (4 out of 7) after the influenza season indicating a misclassification with COVID-19 cases.
Conclusions
Evidence synthesis suggests that NPIs targeted at SARS-CoV-2-transmission reduce influenza burden as well. Low threshold NPIs need to be more strongly emphasized in influenza prevention strategies.

AB  - Epidemic forecasting has a dubious track-record, and its failures became more prominent with COVID-19. Poor data input, wrong modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, poor past evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors, lack of determinacy, consideration of only one or a few dimensions of the problem at hand, lack of expertise in crucial disciplines, groupthink and bandwagon effects, and selective reporting are some of the causes of these failures. Nevertheless, epidemic forecasting is unlikely to be abandoned. Some (but not all) of these problems can be fixed. Careful modeling of predictive distributions rather than focusing on point estimates, considering multiple dimensions of impact, and continuously reappraising models based on their validated performance may help. If extreme values are considered, extremes should be considered for the consequences of multiple dimensions of impact so as to continuously calibrate predictive insights and decision-making. When major decisions (e.g. draconian lockdowns) are based on forecasts, the harms (in terms of health, economy, and society at large) and the asymmetry of risks need to be approached in a holistic fashion, considering the totality of the evidence.

Notably, the estimated number of excess deaths was reported as 10.8–16.6 per 1000 individuals on dialysis and 2.6–5.5 per 1000 individuals with a prior kidney transplantation. Although not adjusted for confounders, these data suggest that the immunosuppression associated with kidney transplantation is not a dominant determinant of outcomes associated with COVID-19 in this population.

AB  - This communication provides a compilation on aspects of COVID-19 infection control measures, describes the potential role of therapeutic plasma exchange to reduce fatality rates, addresses precautions concerning dexamethasone pharmacotherapy and updates the current status on the availability of vaccines. As part of passive immunotherapy, it focuses on various blood derivatives. These include coronavirus neutralising antibodies extracted from different sources to be administered as a pure hyper concentrate intramuscularly or for upgrading and standardising the specific potency of high affinity antibodies. These processes are intended to compose standardised pooled bioproducts of corona convalescent plasma/cryosupernatant that are pathogen inactivated for additional safety by well-established UV technologies. For the best practice of optimising plasma exchange, hyper concentrate NAb should be added to the cryosupernatant, which contains some of the active principles of corona convalescent plasma. The cryosupernatant apart from the high molecular weight viscous part of cold insoluble proteins that are removed, is equivalent to CCP, but makes it safer for general application. Such a bioproduct is often used routinely for substitution therapy of thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura. Alternative resources of large-scale specific coronavirus antibodies warrant further exploration such as cadaveric donations. The early uses of therapeutic plasma exchange and low molecular weight heparin, for any clinical trial in development is warranted, in order to interdict the intense inflammatory/kinin driven cascade. Because coronavirus positive patients are highly prone to thrombosis, thromboprophylaxis is necessary, even some time after recovery guided by the laboratory data.

AB  - Summary
Background
Obesity is a major risk factor for adverse outcomes after infection with SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to examine this association, including interactions with demographic and behavioural characteristics, type 2 diabetes, and other health conditions.
Methods
In this prospective, community-based, cohort study, we used de-identified patient-level data from the QResearch database of general practices in England, UK. We extracted data for patients aged 20 years and older who were registered at a practice eligible for inclusion in the QResearch database between Jan 24, 2020 (date of the first recorded infection in the UK) and April 30, 2020, and with available data on BMI. Data extracted included demographic, clinical, clinical values linked with Public Health England's database of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, and death certificates from the Office of National Statistics. Outcomes, as a proxy measure of severe COVID-19, were admission to hospital, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), and death due to COVID-19. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the risk of severe COVID-19, sequentially adjusting for demographic characteristics, behavioural factors, and comorbidities.
Findings
Among 6 910 695 eligible individuals (mean BMI 26·78 kg/m2 [SD 5·59]), 13 503 (0·20%) were admitted to hospital, 1601 (0·02%) to an ICU, and 5479 (0·08%) died after a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. We found J-shaped associations between BMI and admission to hospital due to COVID-19 (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per kg/m2 from the nadir at BMI of 23 kg/m2 of 1·05 [95% CI 1·05–1·05]) and death (1·04 [1·04–1·05]), and a linear association across the whole BMI range with ICU admission (1·10 [1·09–1·10]). We found a significant interaction between BMI and age and ethnicity, with higher HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for younger people (adjusted HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for hospital admission 1·09 [95% CI 1·08–1·10] in 20–39 years age group vs 80–100 years group 1·01 [1·00–1·02]) and Black people than White people (1·07 [1·06–1·08] vs 1·04 [1·04–1·05]). The risk of admission to hospital and ICU due to COVID-19 associated with unit increase in BMI was slightly lower in people with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease than in those without these morbidities.
Interpretation
At a BMI of more than 23 kg/m2, we found a linear increase in risk of severe COVID-19 leading to admission to hospital and death, and a linear increase in admission to an ICU across the whole BMI range, which is not attributable to excess risks of related diseases. The relative risk due to increasing BMI is particularly notable people younger than 40 years and of Black ethnicity.

AB  - Background
The recent pandemic by COVID-19 is a global threat to human health. The disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and the infection rate is increased more quickly than MERS and SARS as their rapid adaptation to varied climatic conditions through rapid mutations. It becomes more severe due to the lack of proper therapeutic drugs, insufficient diagnostic tool, scarcity of appropriate drug, life supporting medical facility and mostly lack of awareness. Therefore, preventive measure is one of the important strategies to control. In this context, herbal medicinal plants received a noticeable attention to treat COVID-19 in Indian subcontinent. Here, 44 Indian traditional plants have been discussed with their novel phytochemicals that prevent the novel corona virus. The basic of SARS-CoV-2, their common way of transmission including their effect on immune and nervous system have been discussed. We have analysed their mechanism of action against COVID-19 following in-silico analysis. Their probable mechanism and therapeutic approaches behind the activity of phytochemicals to stimulate immune response as well as inhibition of viral multiplication discussed rationally. Thus, mixtures of active secondary metabolites/phytochemicals are the only choice to prevent the disease in countries where vaccination will take long time due to overcrowded population density.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a current pandemic that has resulted in nearly 250 million cases and over 5 million deaths. While vaccines have been developed to prevent infection, and most COVID-19 cases end up being fairly light, there are severe cases of COVID-19 that may end up in death, even with adequate healthcare treatment. New options to combat this disease’s effects, therefore, could prove to be invaluable in saving lives. Adamalysins are proteins that have several roles in regulating different functions in the human body but are also known to have functions in inflammation. They are also known to have roles in several different diseases, including COVID-19, where ADAM17, in particular, is now well-known to have a prominent role, but also several diseases which include comorbidities that may worsen cases of COVID-19. Therefore, investigating the functions of adamalysins in disease may give us clues to the molecular workings of COVID-19 as well as potentially new therapeutic targets. Understanding these molecular mechanisms may also allow for an understanding of the mechanisms behind the rare severe side effects that occur in response to current COVID-19 vaccines, which may lead to better monitoring measures for people who may be more at risk of developing these side effects. This review investigates the known roles and functions of adamalysins in disease, including what is currently known of their involvement in COVID-19, and how these functions might be involved.

AB  - Background
Recent studies have suggested a blunted immune response to messenger RNA vaccines in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. Given the paucity of data on adenovirus vector vaccines use in immunosuppressed SOT recipients, we sought to describe the safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in a heart transplant population.
Methods
Heart transplant recipients aged 18 to 70 years scheduled to receive 2 doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine were enrolled into a prospective study involving serum analysis to define their antibody response. An antibody concentration against the spike protein receptor-binding domain of ≥0.8 U/mL was deemed a detectable antibody response.
Results
A total of 99 heart transplant recipients (mean age 51 ± 12.5 years, 28% female) were enrolled. No major adverse events were recorded after vaccination; minor symptoms included injection site pain (24%), fatigue (21%) and headache (14%). Of 7 patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by PCR testing, all (100%) had detectable antibody responses following first and second vaccine doses. In those with no prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 92), 24% (n = 22) showed an antibody response after dose 1, increasing to 34.8% (n = 32) after dose 2, p < 0.001. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage ≥3 (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.5-15, p = 0.009) and mycophenolate use (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.2-14, p = 0.02) were independently associated with a nondetectable antibody response.
Conclusions
Almost two-thirds of heart transplant recipients aged 18 to 70 years without a history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection failed to develop a detectable antibody response following administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Patient phenotyping may help predict which patients are less likely to develop detectable antibody responses.

AB  - In the previous publication “Can atmospheric pollution be considered a co-factor in extremely high level of SARS-CoV-2 lethality in Northern Italy?” Conticini et al. hypothesized that the surplus of lethality of the novel SARS-CoV-2 in Northern Italy may be at least in part explained by the evidence of highest pollution reported in this area, as both severe COVID-19 and smog exposure are correlated to an innate immune system hyper-activation with subsequent lung inflammation and injury. Since this hypothesis alone does not fully explain why specific subgroups of patients are at major risk, we hypothesized that obesity may be one of the links between COVID-19 severity and high level of air pollution. First, obesity is a predisposing factor for SARS-Cov-2 infection and worse COVID-19 outcomes, and unequivocal evidence demonstrated that fat mass excess is independently associated with several pulmonary diseases and lung inflammation. Moreover, it has been shown that obesity may intensify the detrimental effects of air pollution on the lungs, and this is not surprising if we consider that these conditions share an excessive activation of the immune system and a lung inflammatory infiltrate. Finally, fat mass excess has also been speculated to be itself a consequence of air pollutants exposure, which has been proved to induce metabolic disruption and weight gain in murine models. In conclusion, although many variables must be taken into account in the analysis of the pandemic, our observations suggest that obesity may act as effect modifier of smog-induced lung-injury, and the concomitant presence of these two factors could better explain the higher virulence, faster spread and greater mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern Italy compared to the rest of the country.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the enveloped double-stranded positive sense RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is responsible for one of the most significant and widespread global pandemic in recent times. It started in China in December 2019 and rapidly spread to each and every country of the world and caused more 521 million infections and more than 6.28 million deaths (as of May 17, 2022) and counting. It primarily infects the respiratory tract, but direct infection thorough other routes (ocular and gastrointestinal) is also reported. The virus can spread easily to different body systems causing multisystemic diseases leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Human gut microbiome is the most complex ecological niche in nature and harbors trillions of microorganisms, predominantly bacteria and viruses. Gut microbiome exists in homeostatic, mutually beneficial, equilibrium with the host in healthy humans. However, any shift in balance towards dysbiosis (unhealthy gut microbiome) due to different factors (such as unhealthy diet, antibiotic use, disease) that modulate microbiome may lead to a variety of diseases and health conditions. Recent studies are demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 infection modulate gut microbiome and gut microbiome can also influence severity of COVID-19. In this review, we summarize our knowledge with focus on the emerging theme of bidirectional cross-talk between gut microbiome and SARS-CoV-2, an important component in formulating strategies to control this formidable virus.

AB  - Summary
Informal (unpaid) carers are an integral part of all societies and the health and social care systems in the UK depend on them. Despite the valuable contributions and key worker status of informal carers, their lived experiences, wellbeing, and needs have been neglected during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this Health Policy, we bring together a broad range of clinicians, researchers, and people with lived experience as informal carers to share their thoughts on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK carers, many of whom have felt abandoned as services closed. We focus on the carers of children and young people and adults and older adults with mental health diagnoses, and carers of people with intellectual disability or neurodevelopmental conditions across different care settings over the lifespan. We provide policy recommendations with the aim of improving outcomes for all carers.

This paper describes and analyzes the following: (a) actions taken by the governments and international community in order to control the spreading and to alleviate negative economic impacts including massive fiscal and monetary stimulus funding; (b) detailed discussions on the impacts of the pandemic on air transport, rail and bus transport, and urban transit, and major countries’ responses to reduce the negative effects; (c) discussions on the positive effects of the pandemic on the environment and climate change by suggesting policy measures in order to make it sustainable over the long term. Finally, the paper addresses social acceptance issue of the behavioral changes necessary in the post-pandemic world, in particular reflecting historical experience of the Spanish flu case. We end the paper with some observations and discussion of the normative issues for a sustainable development of the transport sector.

AB  - Background
Many nutrients have powerful immunomodulatory actions with the potential to alter susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, progression to symptoms, likelihood of severe disease, and survival.
Objective
The aim was to review the latest evidence on how malnutrition across all its forms (under- and overnutrition and micronutrient status) may influence both susceptibility to, and progression of, COVID-19.
Methods
We synthesized information on 13 nutrition-related components and their potential interactions with COVID-19: overweight, obesity, and diabetes; protein-energy malnutrition; anemia; vitamins A, C, D, and E; PUFAs; iron; selenium; zinc; antioxidants; and nutritional support. For each section we provide: 1) a landscape review of pertinent material; 2) a systematic search of the literature in PubMed and EMBASE databases, including a wide range of preprint servers; and 3) a screen of 6 clinical trial registries. All original research was considered, without restriction to study design, and included if it covered: 1) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), or SARS-CoV viruses and 2) disease susceptibility or 3) disease progression, and 4) the nutritional component of interest. Searches took place between 16 May and 11 August 2020.
Results
Across the 13 searches, 2732 articles from PubMed and EMBASE, 4164 articles from the preprint servers, and 433 trials were returned. In the final narrative synthesis, we include 22 published articles, 38 preprint articles, and 79 trials.
Conclusions
Currently there is limited evidence that high-dose supplements of micronutrients will either prevent severe disease or speed up recovery. However, results of clinical trials are eagerly awaited. Given the known impacts of all forms of malnutrition on the immune system, public health strategies to reduce micronutrient deficiencies and undernutrition remain of critical importance. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes will reduce the risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes. This review is registered at PROSPERO as CRD42020186194.

AB  - COVAX, the international initiative supporting COVID-19 vaccination campaigns globally, is budgeted to be the costliest public health initiative in low- and middle-income countries, with over 16 billion US dollars already committed. While some claim that the target of vaccinating 70% of people worldwide is justified on equity grounds, we argue that this rationale is wrong for two reasons. First, mass COVID-19 vaccination campaigns do not meet standard public health requirements for clear expected benefit, based on costs, disease burden and intervention effectiveness. Second, it constitutes a diversion of resources from more cost-effective and impactful public health programmes, thus reducing health equity. We conclude that the COVAX initiative warrants urgent review.

AB  - Background
China implemented containment measures to stop SARS-CoV-2 transmission in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. After the first epidemic wave, we conducted population-based serological surveys to determine extent of infection, risk factors for infection, and neutralization antibody levels to assess the real infections in the random sampled population.
Methods
We used a multistage, stratified cluster random sampling strategy to conduct serological surveys in three areas - Wuhan, Hubei Province outside Wuhan, and six provinces selected on COVID-19 incidence and containment strategy. Participants were consenting individuals >1 year old who resided in the survey area >14 days during the epidemic. Provinces screened sera for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG, and total antibody by two lateral flow immunoassays and one magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay; positive samples were verified by micro-neutralization assay.
Findings
We enrolled 34,857 participants (overall response rate, 92%); 427 were positive by micro-neutralization assay. Wuhan had the highest weighted seroprevalence (4•43%, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]=3•48%-5•62%), followed by Hubei-ex-Wuhan (0•44%, 95%CI=0•26%-0•76%), and the other provinces (<0•1%). Living in Wuhan (adjusted odds ratio aOR=13•70, 95%CI= 7•91–23•75), contact with COVID-19 patients (aOR=7•35, 95%CI=5•05–10•69), and age over 40 (aOR=1•36, 95%CI=1•07–1•72) were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among seropositives, 101 (24%) reported symptoms and had higher geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers than among the 326 (76%) without symptoms (30±2•4 vs 15±2•1, p<0•001).
Interpretation
The low overall extent of infection and steep gradient of seropositivity from Wuhan to the outer provinces provide evidence supporting the success of containment of the first wave of COVID-19 in China. SARS-CoV-2 infection was largely asymptomatic, emphasizing the importance of active case finding and physical distancing. Virtually the entire population of China remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2; vaccination will be needed for long-term protection.

AB  - The two genetically similar severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, have each been responsible for global epidemics of vastly different scales. Although both viruses arose from similar origins, they quickly diverged due to differences in their transmission dynamics and spectrum of clinical presentations. The potential involvement of multiple organs systems, including the respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal and neurological, during infection necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the clinical pathogenesis of each virus. The management of COVID-19, initially modelled after SARS and other respiratory illnesses, has continued to evolve as we accumulate more knowledge and experience during the pandemic, as well as develop new therapeutics and vaccines. The impact of these two coronaviruses has been profound for our health care and public health systems, and we hope that the lessons learned will not only bring the current pandemic under control, but also prevent and reduce the impact of future pandemics.

AB  - Summary
Background
In line with movement restrictions and physical distancing essential for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO recommended postponement of all neglected tropical disease (NTD) control activities that involve community-based surveys, active case finding, and mass drug administration in April, 2020. Following revised guidance later in 2020, and after interruptions to NTD programmes of varying lengths, NTD programmes gradually restarted in the context of an ongoing pandemic. However, ongoing challenges and service gaps have been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the potential effect of the programmatic interruptions and strategies to mitigate this effect.
Methods
For seven NTDs, namely soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, trachoma, visceral leishmaniasis, and human African trypanosomiasis, we used mathematical transmission models to simulate the effect of programme interruptions on the dynamics of each of these diseases in different endemic settings. We also explored the potential benefit of implementing mitigation strategies, primarily in terms of minimising the delays to control targets.
Findings
We show that the effect of the COVID-19-induced interruption in terms of delay to achieving elimination goals might in some cases be much longer than the duration of the interruption. For schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, trachoma, and visceral leishmaniasis, a mean delay of 2–3 years for a 1-year interruption is predicted in areas of highest prevalence. We also show that these delays can largely be mitigated by measures such as additional mass drug administration or enhanced case-finding.
Interpretation
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought infectious disease control to the forefront of global consciousness. It is essential that the NTDs, so long neglected in terms of research and financial support, are not overlooked, and remain a priority in health service planning and funding.

Hence, COVID-19 prevalence and outcome data in Parkinson's disease patients were disseminated at a time when we only had part of the picture. In this chapter we firstly discuss the current literature on the prevalence of COVID-19 in people with PD. We then discuss outcomes from COVID-19 in people with PD, specifically risk of hospitalization and mortality. Finally, we discuss specific contributing and confounding factors which may put PD patients at higher or lower risk from COVID-19.

AB  - Identifying and examining factors affecting the use of the subway is critical for developing countries as they struggle with high levels of auto use and resulting congestion, noise and air pollution. In this research, we surveyed students of a top-ranked university in the capital of Iran before and after the COVID-19 outbreak to identify the factors affecting their use of the subway. Chi-square tests show that gender, level of education, and being the only child of the family have the highest impact on using a private car. These variables had no significant influence on students' mode choice to university before the COVID-19 pandemic, when students' mode choice was only a function of their residence location. However, the pandemic has affected priorities for mode choice. For instance, hygiene and social distancing, which were previously insignificant to students, are now among their top criteria, and travel time and cost are less important for students than in the past. As a result, subway use has significantly decreased. Based on the results of the research, when making relevant policies, more attention should be paid to the groups of women, undergraduate students and single children that are more likely to use private cars.

AB  - Abstracts
Developing and distributing a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccine has garnered immense global interest. Less than a year after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, several vaccine candidates had received emergency use authorization across a range of countries. Despite this scientific breakthrough, the journey from vaccine discovery to global herd immunity against COVID-19 continues to present significant policy challenges that require a collaborative, global response. We offer a framework for understanding remaining and new policy challenges for successful global vaccine campaigns against COVID-19 as well as potential solutions to address them. Decision-makers must be aware of these challenges and strategize solutions that can be implemented at scale. These include challenges around maintaining R&D incentives, running clinical trials, authorizations, post-market surveillance, manufacturing and supply, global dissemination, allocation, uptake, and clinical system adaption. Alongside these challenges, financial and ethical concerns must also be addressed.

AB  - The novel corona virus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread throughout the globe at a formidable speed, causing tens of millions of cases and more than one million deaths in less than a year of its report in December 2019. Since then, companies and research institutions have raced to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, ranging from conventional viral and protein-based vaccines to those that are more cutting edge, including DNA- and mRNA-based vaccines. Each vaccine exhibits a different potency and duration of efficacy, as determined by the antigen design, adjuvant molecules, vaccine delivery platforms, and immunization method. In this review, we will introduce a few of the leading non-viral vaccines that are under clinical stage development and discuss delivery strategies to improve vaccine efficacy, duration of protection, safety, and mass vaccination.

AB  - Purpose
Racial/ethnic minoritized groups, women, and economically disadvantaged groups are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated racial/ethnic differences by gender in correlates of COVID-19 infection among veterans seeking health care services at the Veterans Health Administration. Little is known about gender-specific factors associated with infection among veterans. This study seeks to fill this gap.
Methods
The sample was veterans with results from a COVID-19 test (polymerase chain reaction) conducted at Veterans Health Administration facilities between March 1, 2020, and August 5, 2020, and linked to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index data (39,223 women and 316,380 men). Bivariate, multivariate logistic, and predicted probability analyses were conducted. All analyses were stratified by gender.
Results
Similar percentages of women and men tested positive for COVID-19 (9.6% vs. 10.0%). In multivariate analysis, compared with non-Hispanic White women, American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, and Hispanic women all had significantly higher odds of infection. Similar racial/ethnic differences were found for men. Both older men and women (>40 years) had lower odds of infection, but the age cut points differed (40 for women, 55 for men). Men 80 years and older had a higher odds than those aged less than 40 years of age. For men, but not for women, being employed (vs. unemployed) was associated with an increased odds of infection, and having comorbidities was associated with decreased odds. There were significant differences within and across gender-by-race/ethnicity in infection, after adjusting for covariates.
Conclusions
American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and Black women and men veterans are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 infection. Widespread testing and tracking, education, and outreach regarding COVID-19 mitigation and vaccination efforts are recommended.

AB  - Severely ill COVID–19 (Corona Virus Disease of 2019) patients have a hyperinflammatory condition with a high concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines termed the cytokine storm. This milieu is reported to cause acute lung injury, oxygen deprivation, multiorgan damage, critical illness, and often death. Post SARS–CoV–2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection, the fight between the invading virus and the host's immune system would either terminate in recovery, with eradication of the infection and regulation of the immune system; or there would be a continuation of immune attacks even after the virus has been cleared, leading to immune dysregulation and disease. This outcome is chiefly dependent on two factors: (1) the patient's immune response, and (2) sufficiency plus efficiency of the regulator(s). Concerning the first, the present research introduces a framework based on different types of immune responses to SARS–CoV–2 along with known disease examples, and how this relates to varying clinical outcomes and treatment needs for COVID–19 patients. About the second factor of ‘regulator(s)’, part 1 of the manuscript described in depth the regulatory role of progesterone in COVID–19. The present study investigates five immunity patterns and the status of the regulatory hormone progesterone with respect to the two established demographic risk factors for COVID–19 high-severity: male sex, and old age. The study evaluates the status of progesterone as a credible determinant of immune regulation and dysregulation. It duly relates the immunity patterns to clinical outcomes and evinces indications for clinical use of progesterone in COVID–19. It proposes a clear answer to the question: "why are males and old patients most likely to have critical illness due to COVID–19?" The study highlights clinical domains for the use of progesterone in COVID–19. Part 2 of this research introduces the concept of immunity patterns and immunity grading. These concepts herewith provided for the clinical course of COVID–19 also apply to other hyperinflammatory conditions. Possible clinical applications of progesterone to treat critically ill COVID–19 patients will open an avenue for hormonal treatments of infections and other immune-related diseases.

AB  - Background
During 2021, Peru started the vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 using the BBIBP-CorV inactivated virus vaccine for health care workers (HCW). We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and deaths among HCWs.
Methods
Retrospective cohort study, from February 9 to June 30, 2021, using national registries of health care workers, laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 and deaths. We calculated the vaccine effectiveness for preventing laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-mortality, and all-cause mortality among partially immunized and fully immunized HCWs. An extension of Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the mortality results, and Poisson regression was used to model SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Results
The study included 606,772 eligible HCWs, the mean age was 40 (IQR: 33.0, 51.0). In fully immunized HCW, the effectiveness for preventing all-cause mortality was 83.6 (95% CI: 80.2 to 86.4), 88.7 (95% CI: 85.1 to 91.4) for preventing COVID-19 mortality, and 40.3 (95% CI 38.9 to 41.6) for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Conclusion
The BBIBP-CorV vaccine showed high levels of effectiveness for preventing all-cause and COVID-19 deaths among fully immunized HCW. These results were consistent within different subgroups and sensitivity analyses. However, the effectiveness for preventing infection was suboptimal in this particular setting.

AB  - Background
Cancer diagnostics and surgery have been disrupted by the response of health care services to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Progression of cancers during delay will impact on patients' long-term survival.
Patients and methods
We generated per-day hazard ratios of cancer progression from observational studies and applied these to age-specific, stage-specific cancer survival for England 2013–2017. We modelled per-patient delay of 3 and 6 months and periods of disruption of 1 and 2 years. Using health care resource costing, we contextualise attributable lives saved and life-years gained (LYGs) from cancer surgery to equivalent volumes of COVID-19 hospitalisations.
Results
Per year, 94 912 resections for major cancers result in 80 406 long-term survivors and 1 717 051 LYGs. Per-patient delay of 3/6 months would cause attributable death of 4755/10 760 of these individuals with loss of 92 214/208 275 life-years, respectively. For cancer surgery, average LYGs per patient are 18.1 under standard conditions and 17.1/15.9 with a delay of 3/6 months (an average loss of 0.97/2.19 LYGs per patient), respectively. Taking into account health care resource units (HCRUs), surgery results on average per patient in 2.25 resource-adjusted life-years gained (RALYGs) under standard conditions and 2.12/1.97 RALYGs following delay of 3/6 months. For 94 912 hospital COVID-19 admissions, there are 482 022 LYGs requiring 1 052 949 HCRUs. Hospitalisation of community-acquired COVID-19 patients yields on average per patient 5.08 LYG and 0.46 RALYGs.
Conclusions
Modest delays in surgery for cancer incur significant impact on survival. Delay of 3/6 months in surgery for incident cancers would mitigate 19%/43% of LYGs, respectively, by hospitalisation of an equivalent volume of admissions for community-acquired COVID-19. This rises to 26%/59%, respectively, when considering RALYGs. To avoid a downstream public health crisis of avoidable cancer deaths, cancer diagnostic and surgical pathways must be maintained at normal throughput, with rapid attention to any backlog already accrued.

AB  - Background
While dialysis patients are at greater risk of serious SARS-CoV-2 complications, stringent infection prevention measures can help mitigate infection and transmission risks within dialysis facilities. We describe an outbreak of 14 cases diagnosed in a hospital-based outpatient ESRD facility over 13 days in the second quarter of 2021, and our coordinated use of epidemiology, viral genome sequencing, and infection control practices to quickly end the transmission cycle.
Methods
Symptomatic patients and staff members were diagnosed by RT-PCR. Facility-wide screening utilized SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained from residual diagnostic specimens.
Results
Of the 106 patients receiving dialysis in the facility, 10 were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as was 1 patient support person. Of 3 positive staff members, 2 were unvaccinated and had provided care for 6 and 4 of the affected patients, respectively. Sequencing demonstrated that all cases in the cluster shared an identical B.1.1.7./Alpha substrain. Attack rates were greatest among unvaccinated patients and staff. Vaccine effectiveness was 88% among patients.
Conclusions
Prompt recognition of an infection cluster and rapid intervention efforts successfully ended the outbreak. Alongside consistent adherence to core infection prevention measures, vaccination was highly effective in reducing disease incidence and morbidity in this vulnerable population.

AB  - For accelerating the tourism recovery under COVID-19, gaining residents' support is essential. However, residents' negative emotion and their perception of the governments' policies in responding to the COVID-19 may affect their attitude toward this support. The study aims to explore the mechanism of how Quality of Government (QoG) ultimately influences residents' support of the government policy for accelerating tourism recovery. The results of two empirical surveys in Macau and South Korea find that the two components of QoG (policy responsiveness and information transparency) positively influence residents' support of the government policy for accelerating tourism recovery through satisfaction with policy response and trust in government. On the other hand, these two QoG components negatively influence residents’ anxiety, and anxiety further negatively influences trust, but anxiety does not have any effect on satisfaction. The study contributes a satisfaction-trust of the governance model for researchers to taking tourism risk research. Recommendations are provided for governments in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two other coronaviruses that caused disease epidemic breakouts in humans in the last 2 decades, namely, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The similarities have enabled the scientists to apply the basic scientific discoveries garnered from studying the structure and modus operandi of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to develop therapies that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 and to develop vaccines to prevent COVID-19. Targeted therapies including the use of antibodies to prevent virus entry, nucleotide analogues to prevent viral replication, and inhibitors of proteases to prevent virion formation, among others, are being tested for their clinical efficacy. Likewise, complete sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 and identification of its structural and nonstructural proteins have enabled development of RNA-, DNA-, and peptide-based vaccines as well attenuated viral vaccines to instigate the host-immune responses. The clinical impacts of the basic science discoveries are amply evident on the rapid pace of progress in developing specific antiviral therapies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The progress emphasizes the merit of discovering the fundamental scientific elements, regardless of whether or not they have apparent or immediate clinical applications.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a unique worldwide pandemic. With new mutations of the virus with higher transmission rates, it is imperative to diagnose positive cases as quickly and accurately as possible. Therefore, a fast, accurate, and automatic system for COVID-19 diagnosis can be very useful for clinicians. In this study, seven machine learning and four deep learning models were presented to diagnose positive cases of COVID-19 from three routine laboratory blood tests datasets. Three correlation coefficient methods, i.e., Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall, were used to demonstrate the relevance among samples. A four-fold cross-validation method was used to train, validate, and test the proposed models. In all three datasets, the proposed deep neural network (DNN) model achieved the highest values of accuracy, precision, recall or sensitivity, specificity, F1-Score, AUC, and MCC. On average, accuracy 92.11%, specificity 84.56%, and AUC 92.20% values have been obtained in the first dataset. In the second dataset, on average, accuracy 93.16%, specificity 93.02%, and AUC 93.20% values have been obtained. Finally, in the third dataset, on average, the values of accuracy 92.5%, specificity 85%, and AUC 92.20% have been obtained. In this study, we used a statistical t-test to validate the results. Finally, using artificial intelligence interpretation methods, important and impactful features in the developed model were presented. The proposed DNN model can be used as a supplementary tool for diagnosing COVID-19, which can quickly provide clinicians with highly accurate diagnoses of positive cases in a timely manner.

AB  - 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) had a big impact in Italy, mainly concentrated in the northern part of the Country. All this was mainly due to similarities of this area with Wuhan in Hubei Province, according to geographical, environmental and socio-economic points of view. The basic hypothesis of this research was that the presence of atmospheric pollutants can generate stress on health conditions of the population and determine pre-conditions for the development of diseases of the respiratory system and complications related to them. In most cases the attention on environmental aspects is mainly concentrated on pollution, neglecting issues such as land management which, in some way, can contribute to reducing the impact of pollution. The reduction of land take and the decrease in the loss of ecosystem services can represent an important aspect in improving environmental quality. In order to integrate policies for environmental change and human health, the main factors analyzed in this paper can be summarized in environmental, climatic and land management. The main aim of this paper was to produce three different hazard scenarios respectively related to environmental, climatic and land management-related factors. A Spatial Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method has been applied over thirteen informative layers grouped in aggregation classes of environmental, climatic and land management. The results of the health hazard maps show a disparity in the distribution of territorial responses to the pandemic in Italy. The environmental components play an extremely relevant role in the definition of the red zones of hazard, with a consequent urgent need to renew sustainable development strategies. The comparison of hazard maps related to different scenarios provides decision makers with tools to orient policy choices with a different degree of priority according to a place-based approach. In particular, the geospatial representation of risks could be a tool for legitimizing the measures chosen by decision-makers, proposing a renewed approach that highlights and takes account of the differences between the spatial contexts to be considered - Regions, Provinces, Municipalities - also in terms of climatic and environmental variables.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Background
Despite the growing evidence on COVID-19, there are still many gaps in the understanding of this disease, especially in individuals in advanced age. We describe the study protocol of GeroCovid Observational, a multi-purpose, multi-setting and multicenter initiative that aims at investigating: risk factors, clinical presentation and outcomes of individuals affected by COVID-19 in acute and residential care settings; best strategies to prevent infection in long-term care facilities; and, impact of the pandemic on neuropsychologic, functional and physical health, and on medical management in outpatients and home care patients at risk of COVID-19, with a special focus on individuals with dementia.
Methods
GeroCovid involves individuals aged ≥60 years, at risk of or affected by COVID-19, prospectively or retrospectively observed since March 1st, 2020. Data are collected in multiple investigational sites across Italy, Spain and Norway, and recorded in a de-identified clinical e-Registry. A common framework was adapted to different care settings: acute wards, long-term care facilities, geriatric outpatient and home care, and outpatient memory clinics.
Results
At September 16th, 2020, 66 investigational sites obtained their Ethical Committee approval and 1618 cases (mean age 80.6 [SD=9.0] years; 45% men) have been recorded in the e-Registry. The average inclusion rate since the study start on April 25th, 2020, is 11.2 patients/day.

AB  - We use county level data from the United States to document the role of social capital the evolution of COVID-19 between January 2020 and January 2021. We find that social capital differentials in COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations depend on the dimension of social capital and the timeframe considered. Communities with higher levels of relational and cognitive social capital were especially successful in lowering COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations than communities with lower social capital between late March and early April. A difference of one standard deviation in relational social capital corresponded to a reduction of 30% in the number of COVID-19 deaths recorded. After April 2020, differentials in COVID-19 deaths related to relational social capital persisted although they became progressively less pronounced. By contrast, the period of March–April 2020, our estimates suggest that there was no statistically significant difference in the number of deaths recorded in areas with different levels of cognitive social capital. In fact, from late June-early July onwards the number of new deaths recorded as being due to COVID-19 was higher in communities with higher levels of cognitive social capital. The overall number of deaths recorded between January 2020 and January 2021 was lower in communities with higher levels of relational social capital. Our findings suggest that the association between social capital and public health outcomes can vary greatly over time and across indicators of social capital.

AB  - The initial response to the Covid-19 pandemic was characterised by swift “lockdowns,” a cluster of measures defined by a shared goal of suppressing Covid-19 and a shared character of restricting departure from the home except for specific purposes. By mid-April 2020, most countries were implementing stringent measures of this kind. This essay contends that (1) some epidemiologists played a central role in formulating and promulgating lockdown as a policy and (2) lockdowns were foreseeably harmful to the Global Poor, and foreseeably offered them little benefit, relative to less stringent measures. In view of the widespread commitment to reducing global health inequalities within the profession, this should prompt reflection within the epidemiological community and further work on pandemic response measures more appropriate for the Global Poor.

AB  - ABSTRACT
In the aging population, the longitudinal decrease in the secretion of steroidal and polypeptides growth hormones is directly associated with accumulation of senescent cells in tissues and organs. The cellular hypo-replicative senescence state is caused by metabolic stress and persistent DNA damage, which lead to the activation of the p16INK4a cell-cycle inhibitor, retinoblastoma and p53 pathways. Aging increases the susceptibility to physical frailty, sarcopenia, diabetes, atherosclerosis, infectious disease and cancer in the older adults. As a consequence of immunosenescence and reduced immunoreactivity of the innate and adaptive systems, seniors have a weak response to vaccination. The high doses of vaccines have been recommended to boost growth and activation of memory T and B cells in non-responsive older individuals, but it is not sufficient for long-term protection. The treatment with recombinant human growth hormone has been shown to regenerate thymus and increase the repertoire of naive T cells CD4+ and CD8+ T cell and B cell subsets in people with age-related diseases, chronic viral infection and immunodeficiencies. This review presents an update on senescence biology and their clinical immunological manifestations in the elderly. We describe possible immune mechanisms by which personalized recombinant growth hormone therapy could act to prolong the effectiveness of the vaccines recommended to older adults.

AB  - An important unknown during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been the infection fatality rate (IFR). This differs from the case fatality rate (CFR) as an estimate of the number of deaths and as a proportion of the total number of cases, including those who are mild and asymptomatic. While the CFR is extremely valuable for experts, IFR is increasingly being called for by policy makers and the lay public as an estimate of the overall mortality from COVID-19.
Methods
Pubmed, Medline, SSRN, and Medrxiv were searched using a set of terms and Boolean operators on 25/04/2020 and re-searched on 14/05/2020, 21/05/2020 and 16/06/2020. Articles were screened for inclusion by both authors. Meta-analysis was performed in Stata 15.1 by using the metan command, based on IFR and confidence intervals extracted from each study. Google/Google Scholar was used to assess the grey literature relating to government reports.
Results
After exclusions, there were 24 estimates of IFR included in the final meta-analysis, from a wide range of countries, published between February and June 2020. The meta-analysis demonstrated a point estimate of IFR of 0.68% (0.53%–0.82%) with high heterogeneity (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of published evidence on COVID-19 until July 2020, the IFR of the disease across populations is 0.68% (0.53%–0.82%). However, due to very high heterogeneity in the meta-analysis, it is difficult to know if this represents a completely unbiased point estimate. It is likely that, due to age and perhaps underlying comorbidities in the population, different places will experience different IFRs due to the disease. Given issues with mortality recording, it is also likely that this represents an underestimate of the true IFR figure. More research looking at age-stratified IFR is urgently needed to inform policymaking on this front.

AB  - This paper uses time-frequency analysis, including wavelet analysis and time-frequency domain causality, to evaluate the relationship between public attention to the COVID-19 pandemic, crude oil, and gold markets in the G7 countries over time and frequency. Empirical findings show that WTI oil lead gold returns during the COVID-19 outbreak, and vice versa when Omicron spread. The relationship between public attention to the COVID-19 and WTI oil/gold markets appears to be heterogeneous for G7 countries. European public attention caused by the COVID-19 outbreak has a strong impact on gold returns at the 32–64 day frequency, while public attention generated by Omicron has a significant effect on WTI oil returns at 4–128 day frequency. The public in the US and Canada is more concerned about the global stock and WTI oil markets slump than the COVID-19 pandemic. The Italian public seems to be the most sensitive to the EU's economic support plan. The heterogeneity of the public attention-oil/gold nexus in the G7 implies that portfolio diversification across markets and investment horizons may be extremely beneficial.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated global pandemic resulting in >400 million infections worldwide and several million deaths. The continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to potentially evade vaccines and monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapies and the limited number of authorized small-molecule antivirals necessitates the need for development of new drug treatments. There remains an unmet medical need for effective and convenient treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that depends on host intracellular ribonucleotide pools for its replication. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a ubiquitous host enzyme that is required for de novo pyrimidine synthesis. The inhibition of DHODH leads to a depletion of intracellular pyrimidines, thereby impacting viral replication in vitro. Brequinar (BRQ) is an orally available, selective, and potent low nanomolar inhibitor of human DHODH that has been shown to exhibit broad spectrum inhibition of RNA virus replication. However, host cell nucleotide salvage pathways can maintain intracellular pyrimidine levels and compensate for BRQ-mediated DHODH inhibition. In this report, we show that the combination of BRQ and the salvage pathway inhibitor dipyridamole (DPY) exhibits strong synergistic antiviral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 by enhanced depletion of the cellular pyrimidine nucleotide pool. The combination of BRQ and DPY showed antiviral activity against the prototype SARS-CoV-2 as well as the Beta (B.1.351) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants. These data support the continued evaluation of the combination of BRQ and DPY as a broad-spectrum, host-acting antiviral strategy to treat SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other RNA virus infections.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, with dramatic suddenness spread worldwide, causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A broad-spectrum of clinical manifestations and complications of COVID-19 exist; in particular, outcomes of disease markedly differ between adults and children. COVID-19 infection in pediatric populations is usually asymptomatic and commonly mild with very low risk of death. While children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are less likely to develop severe illness, certain underlying medical conditions might increase the risk of severe disease. Therefore, it is critical to investigate host–pathogen interaction, including tissue tropism, viral replication and mechanism of dissemination in pediatrics, and how these factors interact in different age groups. This narrative review attempts to explain the pathogenesis and pathology associated with multisystemic inflammatory syndrome, chilblains, thromboses, cardiothoracic pathology, and maternofetal pathology in the placenta through clinical cases described in the literature.

AB  - Summary
Background
Public health emergencies can disrupt the provision of and access to essential health-care services, exacerbating health crises. We aimed to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on essential health-care services in Kenya.
Methods
Using county-level data routinely collected from the health information system from health facilities across the country, we used a robust mixed-effect model to examine changes in 17 indicators of essential health services across four periods: the pre-pandemic period (from January, 2018 to February, 2020), two pandemic periods (from March to November 2020, and February to October, 2021), and the period during the COVID-19-associated health-care workers’ strike (from December, 2020 to January, 2021).
Findings
In the pre-pandemic period, we observed a positive trend for multiple indicators. The onset of the pandemic was associated with statistically significant decreases in multiple indicators, including outpatient visits (28·7%; 95% CI 16·0–43·5%), cervical cancer screening (49·8%; 20·6–57·9%), number of HIV tests conducted (45·3%; 23·9–63·0%), patients tested for malaria (31·9%; 16·7–46·7%), number of notified tuberculosis cases (26·6%; 14·7–45·1%), hypertension cases (10·4%; 6·0–39·4%), vitamin A supplements (8·7%; 7·9–10·5%), and three doses of the diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis vaccine administered (0·9%; 0·5–1·3%). Pneumonia cases reduced by 50·6% (31·3–67·3%), diarrhoea by 39·7% (24·8–62·7%), and children attending welfare clinics by 39·6% (23·5–47·1%). Cases of sexual violence increased by 8·0% (4·3–25·0%). Skilled deliveries, antenatal care, people with HIV infection newly started on antiretroviral therapy, confirmed cases of malaria, and diabetes cases detected were not significantly affected negatively. Although most of the health indicators began to recover during the pandemic, the health-care workers’ strike resulted in nearly all indicators falling to numbers lower than those observed at the onset or during the pre-strike pandemic period.
Interpretation
The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated health-care workers’ strike in Kenya have been associated with a substantial disruption of essential health services, with the use of outpatient visits, screening and diagnostic services, and child immunisation adversely affected. Efforts to maintain the provision of these essential health services during a health-care crisis should target the susceptible services to prevent the exacerbation of associated disease burdens during such health crises.

AB  - Summary
One year into the global COVID-19 pandemic, the focus of attention has shifted to the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). After nearly a year of the pandemic with little evolutionary change affecting human health, several variants have now been shown to have substantial detrimental effects on transmission and severity of the virus. Public health officials, medical practitioners, scientists, and the broader community have since been scrambling to understand what these variants mean for diagnosis, treatment, and the control of the pandemic through nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccines. Here we explore the evolutionary processes that are involved in the emergence of new variants, what we can expect in terms of the future emergence of VOCs, and what we can do to minimise their impact.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Ever since its emergence, the highly transmissible and debilitating coronavirus disease spread at an incredibly fast rate, causing global devastation in a matter of months. SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, infects hosts after binding to ACE2 receptors present on cells from many structures pertaining to the respiratory, cardiac, hematological, neurological, renal and gastrointestinal systems. COVID-19, however, appears to trigger a severe cytokine storm syndrome in pulmonary structures, resulting in oxidative stress, exacerbated inflammation and alveolar injury. Due to the recent nature of this disease no treatments have shown complete efficacy and safety. More recently, however, researchers have begun to direct some attention towards GSH and NAC. These natural antioxidants play an essential role in several biological processes in the body, especially the maintenance of the redox equilibrium. In fact, many diseases appear to be strongly related to severe oxidative stress and deficiency of endogenous GSH. The high ratios of ROS over GSH, in particular, appear to reflect severity of symptoms and prolonged hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. This imbalance interferes with the body's ability to detoxify the cellular microenvironment, fold proteins, replenish antioxidant levels, maintain healthy immune responses and even modulate apoptotic events. Oral administration of GSH and NAC is convenient and safe, but they are susceptible to degradation in the digestive tract. Considering this drawback, nebulization of GSH and NAC as an adjuvant therapy may therefore be a viable alternative for the management of the early stages of COVID-19.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic provides a stark reminder of the political tensions associated with the field of immigration and health, highlighting the central role that nationalism, racism and xenophobia play in determining responses to communicable diseases. The blurring of global health, immigration governance, and the global health security agendas has long been recognised. However, an improved understanding of the politics influencing these entanglements, specifically within the context of the Covid-19 response in low- and middle-income country contexts, is urgently needed. This includes – but is not limited to – the immediate concerns surrounding inclusive social, political and medical responses to Covid-19; vaccine nationalism – at both global and national levels; and calls for ‘vaccine passports’. To this end, we draw on the Southern African Development Community (SADC) context – one associated with high levels of diverse population movements and a large burden of communicable diseases – to explore responses to Covid-19. We unpack tensions surrounding the management of migration and the ways in which sovereignty impacts attempts at building regional, coordinated responses to migration and health, and consider how this affects progress towards global health targets. With an initial focus on South Africa, we build on previous work exploring the blurring of global health, immigration governance, and the global health security agendas in SADC, and draw from ongoing research on the governance of migration and health within the region. This includes current and evolving research exploring migration and Covid-19, initiated in March 2020 when the first cases of Covid-19 were identified in Southern Africa. The aim is for these findings to catalyse a new and evolving researh agenda to inform the development and implementation of appropriate pandemic responses in a region associated with some of the highest levels of inequality globally. To this end, an evolving research agenda should be responsive to current needs. We suggest that, in SADC, priority research should focus on improving our understanding of (1) the political factors influencing the (dis)connections between migration and health governance structures in the context of Covid-19, and how to overcome these in the context of a pandemic; and (2) the motivations for and implications of a ‘vaccine passport’ system on movement within and beyond the SADC region. This requires a reactive, cross-disciplinary, regional research network. In a context where funding for research is increasingly inaccessible, this requires innovative, informal, collaborative engagement.

AB  - Summary
The association between vaccines and peripheral facial palsy (PFP), an issue that has been the subject of debate for many years, has been raised again following results of clinical trials assessing mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines. To review the available literature on this topic, PubMed was searched from inception until February 25, 2022. Inclusion criteria were case reports with documented rechallenge and comparative epidemiological studies. Cases of COVID-19 vaccine-induced PFP with available data on vaccine rechallenge were also identified from Vigibase until December 31, 2021. Of the 347 articles retrieved, 32 comparative epidemiological studies, 1 meta-analysis and 4 case reports met our criteria, of which 13 involved COVID-19 vaccines. Eight studies found an association between at least one vaccine and the occurrence of PFP, whereas 24 did not. Positive studies involved seasonal or pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccines administered parenterally (4 studies) or intranasally (1 study with a toxin-adjuvanted vaccine), BNT162b2, a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (1 disproportionality analysis and 1 observed-to-expected analysis) and an inactivated virus COVID-19 vaccine (CoronaVac®) (1 study combining a case-control and an observed-to-expected approach). Strong evidence was found only for the intranasal influenza vaccine while other positive studies detected only a marginal association between PFP and vaccination. Of the four case reports with documented rechallenge, only two were positive and involved an influenza vaccine and tozinameran in one case each. In Vigibase, rechallenge was documented in 49 reports with 29 (59.2%) cases being negative and 20 (40.8%) positive. The available data did not confirm an excess risk of PFP after vaccination in most studies. Moreover, of the eight epidemiological studies suggesting a possible excess risk of PFP after any vaccine, three were disproportionality analyses and two observed-to excepted analyses, suggesting great caution should be taken when interpreting these results.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized in December 2019 in China and as of October5th, the pandemic was swept through 216 countries and infected around 34,824,108 individuals, thus posing an unprecedented threat to world's health and economy. Several researchers reported that, a significant mutation in membrane proteins and receptor binding sites of preceding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to turned as novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and disease was named as COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019). Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19 patients. The lessons learned from the past management of SARS-CoV and other pandemics, have provided some insights to treat COVID-19. Currently, therapies like anti-viral treatment, immunomodulatory agents, plasma transfusion and supportive intervention etc., are using to treat the COVID-19. Few of these were proven to provide significant therapeutic benefits in treating the COVID-19, however no drug is approved by the regulatory agencies. As the fatality rate is high in patients with comorbid conditions, we have also enlightened the current in-line treatment therapies and specific treatment strategies in comorbid conditions to combat the emergence of COVID-19. In addition, pharmaceutical, biological companies and research institutions across the globe have begun to develop thesafe and effective vaccine for COVID-19. Globally around 170 teams of researchers are racing to develop the COVID-19 vaccine and here we have discussed about their current status of development. Furthermore, recent patents filed in association with COVID-19 was elaborated. This can help many individuals, researchers or health workers, in applying these principles for diagnosis/prevention/management/treatment of the current pandemic.

AB  - Modelling the spatiotemporal spread of a highly transmissible disease is challenging. We developed a novel spatiotemporal spread model, and the neighbourhood-level data of COVID-19 in Toronto was fitted into the model to visualize the spread of the disease in the study area within two weeks of the onset of first outbreaks from index neighbourhood to its first-order neighbourhoods (called dispersed neighbourhoods). We also model the data to classify hotspots based on the overall incidence rate and persistence of the cases during the study period. The spatiotemporal spread model shows that the disease spread to 1–4 neighbourhoods bordering the index neighbourhood within two weeks. Some dispersed neighbourhoods became index neighbourhoods and further spread the disease to their nearby neighbourhoods. Most of the sources of infection in the dispersed neighbourhood were households and communities (49%), and after excluding the healthcare institutions (40%), it becomes 82%, suggesting the expansion of transmission was from close contacts. The classification of hotspots informs high-priority areas concentrated in the northwestern and northeastern parts of Toronto. The spatiotemporal spread model along with the hotspot classification approach, could be useful for a deeper understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases and planning for an effective mitigation strategy where local-level spatially enabled data are available.

AB  - The world changed in 2019 when an illness with fevers and respiratory disease of unknown etiology was reported from China. In early December, a 55-year-old Chinese man in Hubei province came to the Hubei Provincial Hospital complaining of fever and cough. Cases slowly increased, especially in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province with 44 cases by the end of December (these were only confirmed cases; physicians cross-verified records confirming this number). The first few cases seemed to emerge from a wet market in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, since many of the first few cases had come from patients who recently visited where many wildlife species were sold. As more cases emerged, social media outlets were labeling it as “SARS,” an acronym for severe acute respiratory syndrome, referencing the 2003 SARS outbreak. Common bacterial and viral causes were ruled out by clinical characteristics, studies, and radiographic imaging. Ultimately, this was labeled as a novel coronavirus—“2019-nCOV”. The World Health Organization held an international Health Regulation Emergency Committee, which declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the end of January 2020.

AB  - The recent pandemic has been the greatest catastrophic event in the last century that has left its irrevocable effect on the socio-economic and cultural environment. The current work presents a combined multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) framework of logarithmic percentage-change driven objective weighting (LOPCOW) and evaluation is based on distance from average solution (EDAS) method to enfold the early impact of COVID-19 on firm performance from fast moving consumer goods and consumer durables sectors in emerging market. Five aspects such as stock performance, dividend payout capability, sales and operational performance, financial stability and economic sustainability are considered for comparing 30 firms over seven consecutive financial years (FY 2013–14 to FY 2020–21). For aggregation of year wise rankings popular methods like Borda count and Copeland methods have been applied. A comparison of results of the LOPCOW-EDAS model with other MCDM methods has been made. It is noticed that the firms which held the overall top positions prior to COVID-19 suffer more afterward than the bottom performers. However, there has not been any major effect of COVID-19 on firms’ financial health and long-term growth prospect. The result shows significant reliability and stability as revealed by the comparative ranking and sensitivity analysis. The proposed framework shall enable the organizations for detailed performance analysis. Some of the policy and managerial implications are also discussed.

AB  - COVID-19 has now spread to all the continents of the world with the possible exception of Antarctica. However, Africa appears different when compared with all the other continents. The absence of exponential growth and the low mortality rates contrary to that experienced in other continents, and contrary to the projections for Africa by various agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO) has been a puzzle to many. Although Africa is the second most populous continent with an estimated 17.2% of the world's population, the continent accounts for only 5% of the total cases and 3% of the mortality. Mortality for the whole of Africa remains at a reported 19,726 as at August 01, 2020. The onset of the pandemic was later, the rate of rise has been slower and the severity of illness and case fatality rates have been lower in comparison to other continents. In addition, contrary to what had been documented in other continents, the occurrence of the renal complications in these patients also appeared to be much lower. This report documents the striking differences between the continents and within the continent of Africa itself and then attempts to explain the reasons for these differences. It is hoped that information presented in this review will help policymakers in the fight to contain the pandemic, particularly within Africa with its resource-constrained health care systems.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is still one of the most important problems for public health, all over the world. However, its importance depends on the number of deaths associated with COVID-19 pathology. Therefore, the challenge can be seen from the epidemiological point of view, in terms of the number of deaths over time, within a certain population. Prevention, new medical approaches, drugs, and vaccines somehow aim at the same two objectives: to lower deaths, it is necessary to slow down infections and/or decrease fatality. Therefore, in order to monitor the importance of the problem, it is interesting to look at how fatality changes over time, in relation to different virus variants. In this chapter, historical data about the Italian situation are employed, and previously proposed statistical methods are applied to calculate the time series of daily estimates of SARS-CoV-2 fatality from the beginning of the pandemic until nowadays. Moreover, the evolution of estimates over time is discussed in correlation with the prevalence of different virus variants.

AB  - Background
The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has cost lives and economic hardships globally. Various studies have found a number of different factors, such as hyperinflammation and exhausted/suppressed T cell responses to the etiological SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), being associated with severe COVID-19. However, sieving the causative from associative factors of respiratory dysfunction has remained rudimentary.
Methods
We postulated that the host responses causative of respiratory dysfunction would track most closely with disease progression and resolution and thus be differentiated from other factors that are statistically associated with but not causative of severe COVID-19. To track the temporal dynamics of the host responses involved, we examined the changes in gene expression in whole blood of 6 severe and 4 non-severe COVID-19 patients across 15 different timepoints spanning the nadir of respiratory function.
Findings
We found that neutrophil activation but not type I interferon signaling transcripts tracked most closely with disease progression and resolution. Moreover, transcripts encoding for protein phosphorylation, particularly the serine-threonine kinases, many of which have known T cell proliferation and activation functions, were increased after and may thus contribute to the upswing of respiratory function. Notably, these associative genes were targeted by dexamethasone, but not methylprednisolone, which is consistent with efficacy outcomes in clinical trials.
Interpretation
Our findings suggest neutrophil activation as a critical factor of respiratory dysfunction in COVID-19. Drugs that target this pathway could be potentially repurposed for the treatment of severe COVID-19.

AB  - Favipiravir, a broad-spectrum RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, inhibits the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at significantly lower concentrations than the plasma trough levels achieved by the dosage adopted for influenza treatment and exhibits efficacy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Although high doses of favipiravir are required due to the molecule being a purine analog, its conversion into the active form in infected cells with active viral RNA synthesis enhances the antiviral specificity and selectivity as a chain terminator with lethal mutagenesis. Another characteristic feature is the lack of generation of favipiravir-resistant virus. COVID-19 pneumonia is caused by strong cell-mediated immunity against virus-infected cells, and the inflammatory response induced by adaptive immunity continues to peak for 3 to 5 days despite antiviral treatment. This has also been observed in herpes zoster (HZ) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia. Inflammation due to an immune response may mask the effectiveness of favipiravir against COVID-19 pneumonia. Favipiravir significantly shortened the recovery time in patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia by 3 days with the start of treatment by the 5th day of symptom onset. Since both CMV and COVID-19 pneumonia are caused by adaptive immunity and prevention of cytomegalovirus pneumonia is the standard treatment due to difficulties in treating refractory CMV pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia should be prevented with early treatment as well. In the present study, we have comprehensively reviewed the optimal antiviral therapy for COVID-19 based on clinical trials of favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia and the concurrently established therapies for other viral infections, particularly HZ and CMV pneumonia. Optimally, antivirals should be administered immediately after COVID-19 diagnosis, similar to that after influenza diagnosis, to prevent COVID-19 pneumonia and complications resulting from microangiopathy.

AB  - The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents an ongoing medical challenge, as it involves multiple organs, including the cardiovascular system. Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) has been described in the context of COVID-19 in 2 different scenarios: as a direct complication of the infection, and as an indirect outcome secondary to the psychological burden of quarantine and social isolation (ie, stress-induced cardiomyopathy). Confirming the diagnosis of TTS in COVID-19 may be challenging due to the limited use of coronary angiography consistent with the recommended guidelines aimed at minimizing contact with infected individuals. The use of natriuretic peptide as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in this context may not be reliable as this peptide is already elevated in severe cases of COVID-19 regardless of TTS diagnosis. A relatively high incidence of complications has been reported in these cases, probably related to the severity of the underlying infectious disease. Although quarantine-induced stress cardiomyopathy is an unsurprising outcome of the powerful stress resulting from the current pandemic, conflicting results have been reported, and further studies are encouraged to determine the true incidence.
Résumé
La maladie à coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) qui sévit actuellement représente un défi médical continu, car elle touche plusieurs organes, dont l'appareil cardiovasculaire. Le syndrome de Takotsubo a été décrit dans le contexte de la COVID-19 en fonction de deux scénarios différents : en tant que complication directe de l'infection et comme conséquence indirecte secondaire du fardeau psychologique imposé par la quarantaine et l'isolement social (c'est-à-dire une cardiomyopathie induite par le stress). La confirmation du diagnostic de syndrome de Takotsubo dans les cas de COVID-19 peut s'avérer difficile en raison du recours limité à la coronarographie, conformément aux recommandations visant à réduire au minimum les contacts avec les personnes infectées. L'utilisation du peptide natriurétique comme marqueur diagnostique et pronostique dans ce contexte peut ne pas être fiable, car le taux de ce peptide est déjà élevé dans les cas sévères de COVID-19, indépendamment du diagnostic de syndrome de Takotsubo. Une incidence relativement élevée de complications a été signalée dans ces cas, probablement liée à la sévérité de la maladie infectieuse sous-jacente. Bien que la cardiomyopathie de stress provoquée par la quarantaine soit un résultat peu étonnant du stress puissant associé à la pandémie actuelle, des résultats contradictoires ont été rapportés; il serait donc bon de mener des études supplémentaires pour en déterminer la véritable incidence.

AB  - ABSTRACT
The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) pandemic is responsible for more than 500,000 deaths in the United States and nearly 3 million worldwide, profoundly altering the landscape of health care delivery. Aggressive public health measures were instituted and hospital efforts became directed at COVID-19–related concerns. Consequently, routine surgical practice was virtually halted, resulting in billions of dollars in hospital losses as pandemic costs escalated. Navigating an uncertain new landscape of scarce resource allocation, exposure risk, role redeployment, and significant practice pattern changes has been challenging. Furthermore, the overall effect on the financial viability of the health care system and vascular surgical practices is yet to be elucidated. This review explores the economic and clinical implications of COVID-19 on the practice of vascular surgery in addition to the health care system as a whole.

AB  - The historical association between respiratory infections and neuropsychiatric symptoms dates back centuries, with more recent literature highlighting a link between viral infections and schizophrenia. Maternal influenza infection during pregnancy has been associated with the development of schizophrenia in offspring. Viral infections in neonates, children, and adolescents have also been associated with later development of schizophrenia. Neuroinvasive and/or systemic infections are thought to increase risk for psychopathology via inflammatory mechanisms, particularly when exposure occurs during critical neurodevelopmental windows. Several human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been associated with psychotic disorders and increasing reports of the neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 suggest it has neuroinvasive properties similar to those of other HCoVs. These properties, in conjunction with its ability to generate a massive inflammatory response, suggest that COVID-19 may also contribute to future psychopathology. This review will summarize the psychopathogenic mechanisms of viral infections and discuss the neuroinvasive and inflammatory properties of COVID-19 that could contribute to the development of psychotic disorders, with a focus on in utero, neonatal, and childhood exposure.

A total of 166 modified herbal formulae consisting of 179 single herbal medicines were collected for treating COVID-19 in China. Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizome, Scutellariae Radix, and Armeniacae Semen Amarum are the most frequently utilized in clinics, most of which are antipyretic (47, 26.26%), expectorant and cough-suppressing (22, 12.29%), and dampness-resolving (21, 11.73%) from traditional descriptions. A total of 1212 chemical components containing β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and quercetin were primarily selected. Additionally, using complex system entropy and unsupervised hierarchical clustering, 8 core herbal combinations and 10 new formulae emerged as potentially useful candidates for COVID-19. Finally, following scaffold analysis, self-organizing mapping (SOM) and cluster analysis, 12 clusters of molecules yielded 8 pharmacophore families of structures that were further screened as pharmacological targets in human metabolic pathways for inhibiting coronavirus. This article aims to make more easily accessible and share historical herbal knowledge used in contemporary treatments in a modern manner to assist researchers contain the global spread of COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
The introduction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the human population represents a tremendous medical and economic crisis. Innate immunity—as the first line of defense of our immune system—plays a central role in combating this novel virus. Here, we provide a conceptual framework for the interaction of the human innate immune system with SARS-CoV-2 to link the clinical observations with experimental findings that have been made during the first year of the pandemic. We review evidence that variability in innate immune system components among humans is a main contributor to the heterogeneous disease courses observed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease spectrum induced by SARS-CoV-2. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms observed for cells and soluble mediators involved in innate immunity is a prerequisite for the development of diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies targeting COVID-19. However, this will also require additional studies addressing causality of events, which so far are lagging behind.

AB  - Summary
The determinants of severe COVID-19 in healthy adults are poorly understood, which limits the opportunity for early intervention. We present a multiomic analysis using machine learning to characterize the genomic basis of COVID-19 severity. We use single-cell multiome profiling of human lungs to link genetic signals to cell-type-specific functions. We discover >1,000 risk genes across 19 cell types, which account for 77% of the SNP-based heritability for severe disease. Genetic risk is particularly focused within natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, placing the dysfunction of these cells upstream of severe disease. Mendelian randomization and single-cell profiling of human NK cells support the role of NK cells and further localize genetic risk to CD56bright NK cells, which are key cytokine producers during the innate immune response. Rare variant analysis confirms the enrichment of severe-disease-associated genetic variation within NK-cell risk genes. Our study provides insights into the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 with potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - Convalescent plasma has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has received emergency use authorization, and is being widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Passive antibody therapy via plasma or serum has been successfully used to treat infectious diseases for more than a century. Passive antibody administration is based on the presumption that convalescent plasma or serum contains therapeutic antibodies that can be passively transferred to the plasma recipient. There are numerous examples in which convalescent plasma has been used successfully as post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment of infectious diseases, including previous coronavirus outbreaks. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, convalescent plasma was demonstrated to be safe and potentially effective among patients infected with COVID-19. This review provides an overview of the historical uses of convalescent plasma therapy, summarizes current evidence for convalescent plasma use for COVID-19, and highlights future antibody therapies.

AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a complex pathologic manifesto of acute lung injury that causes noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in different clinical presentations and increases the mortality rate up to 40%. The main physiologic changes are alveolar collapse/de-recruitment, decreased lung compliance, higher pulmonary vascular resistance, and gas-exchange disturbance, which may be combined with the patient’s own respiratory response or assisted ventilatory support due to regional heterogeneity of the underlying lung injury. Since the main clinical features of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pneumonia are hypoxemia and dyspnea, noninvasive oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation remains the cornerstone of managing more severe cases. The aim of this chapter is to summarize the current state of knowledge on the worst pulmonary manifestation of the long COVID-19 syndrome, namely, COVID–ARDS, including parenchymal and functional abnormalities, follow-up strategies for early identification, and timely therapeutic interventions including veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) management. Although only a limited proportion of COVID-19 patients develop severe respiratory failure refractory to advanced conventional treatments, it is of utmost importance to clearly define criteria for the use of vv-ECMO in this steadily growing patient population. The use of vv-ECMO in COVID–ARDS is a rescue treatment, if mechanical ventilation cannot guarantee appropriate gas exchange anymore, resulting in life-threatening or organ-damaging hypoxia and/or hypercapnia, whereas the vv-ECMO treatment modality still has a high all mortality rate in COVID–ARDS (> 50%).

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the emergence of various stressors among people around the world. However, rare are the studies that investigate stressors by employing institution evaluations as their predictors in ethnic minorities. The goal of the current study was to examine the association between satisfaction with the efficiency of institutions' work on mitigation of the COVID-19 spread, and stressors - emotional responses to the pandemic: worry of the COVID-19 spread, and fear of being hurt by its spread. The study was conducted among Israeli Arab citizens (N = 697), who participated in an annual personal security index survey. Multinomial logistic regression was used for the multivariate analysis. The main finding suggests that satisfaction with efficiency of the emergency institutions performance was associated with a lower likelihood of being highly worried of COVID-19 spread, as well as with a lower likelihood of having a great fear of being hurt by its spread. Satisfaction with efficiency of societal institutions performance was associated only with lower likelihood of being moderately worried of the COVID-19 spread. The results imply that the institutions have an ability to reduce the stressors in population by means of efficient performance in mitigating the consequences of the pandemic. The results also imply that institutions differ in this ability. The main policy implication is that institutions, which efficiency satisfaction was unrelated to the stressors, should significantly improve such performance in order to reduce the magnitude of negative emotional responses in ethnic minorities.

AB  - Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an antibody-mediated immune disorder of the neuromuscular junction. SARS-CoV-2 is now recognised as a trigger factor for autoimmune diseases and to cause immune-mediated dysregulation, likely due to molecular mimicry induced by viral antigens. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, similarly, results in exposure to viral antigen. Here we report 7 cases of new-onset myasthenia gravis in timely association with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, including the first paediatric case identified to date. We also reviewed the literature for other new-onset MG cases reported within 4 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and discuss our findings in the context of altered (auto)immunity following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and/or infection.

AB  - Summary
Background
Real-time prediction is key to prevention and control of infections associated with health-care settings. Contacts enable spread of many infections, yet most risk prediction frameworks fail to account for their dynamics. We developed, tested, and internationally validated a real-time machine-learning framework, incorporating dynamic patient-contact networks to predict hospital-onset COVID-19 infections (HOCIs) at the individual level.
Methods
We report an international retrospective cohort study of our framework, which extracted patient-contact networks from routine hospital data and combined network-derived variables with clinical and contextual information to predict individual infection risk. We trained and tested the framework on HOCIs using the data from 51 157 hospital inpatients admitted to a UK National Health Service hospital group (Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust) between April 1, 2020, and April 1, 2021, intersecting the first two COVID-19 surges. We validated the framework using data from a Swiss hospital group (Department of Rehabilitation, Geneva University Hospitals) during a COVID-19 surge (from March 1 to May 31, 2020; 40 057 inpatients) and from the same UK group after COVID-19 surges (from April 2 to Aug 13, 2021; 43 375 inpatients). All inpatients with a bed allocation during the study periods were included in the computation of network-derived and contextual variables. In predicting patient-level HOCI risk, only inpatients spending 3 or more days in hospital during the study period were examined for HOCI acquisition risk.
Findings
The framework was highly predictive across test data with all variable types (area under the curve [AUC]-receiver operating characteristic curve [ROC] 0·89 [95% CI 0·88–0·90]) and similarly predictive using only contact-network variables (0·88 [0·86–0·90]). Prediction was reduced when using only hospital contextual (AUC-ROC 0·82 [95% CI 0·80–0·84]) or patient clinical (0·64 [0·62–0·66]) variables. A model with only three variables (ie, network closeness, direct contacts with infectious patients [network derived], and hospital COVID-19 prevalence [hospital contextual]) achieved AUC-ROC 0·85 (95% CI 0·82–0·88). Incorporating contact-network variables improved performance across both validation datasets (AUC-ROC in the Geneva dataset increased from 0·84 [95% CI 0·82–0·86] to 0·88 [0·86–0·90]; AUC-ROC in the UK post-surge dataset increased from 0·49 [0·46–0·52] to 0·68 [0·64–0·70]).
Interpretation
Dynamic contact networks are robust predictors of individual patient risk of HOCIs. Their integration in clinical care could enhance individualised infection prevention and early diagnosis of COVID-19 and other nosocomial infections.

AB  - Several factors ranging from environmental risks to the genetics of the virus and that of the hosts, affect the spread of COVID-19. The impact of physicochemical variables on virus vitality and spread should be taken into account in experimental and clinical studies. Another avenue to explore is the effect of diet and its interaction with the immune system on SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality rate. Past year have witnessed extensive studies on virus and pathophysiology of the COVID-19 disease and the cellular mechanisms of virus spreading. However, our knowledge has not reached a level where we plan an efficient therapeutic approach to prevent the virus entry to the cells or decreasing the spreading and morbidity in severe cases of disease. The risk of infection directly correlates with the control of virus spreading via droplets and aerosol transmission, as well as patient immune system response. A key goal in virus restriction and transmission rate is to understand the physicochemical structure of aerosol and droplet formation, and the parameters that affect the droplet-borne and airborne in different environmental conditions. The lifetime of droplets on different surfaces is described based on the contact angle. Hereby, we recommend regular use of high-quality face masks in high temperature and low humidity conditions. However, in humid and cold weather conditions, wearing gloves and frequently hand washing, gain a higher priority. Additionally, social distancing rules should be respected in all aforementioned conditions. We will also discuss different routes of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells and how multiple genetic factors play a role in the spread of the virus. Given the role of environmental and nutritional factors, we discuss and recommend some strategies to prevent the disease and protect the population against COVID-19. Since an effective vaccine can prevent the transmission of communicable diseases and abolish pandemics, we added a brief review of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently emerged pathogen that has caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the worst pandemic of our times leading to tremendous loss of human life and unprecedented measures of social distancing. COVID-19 symptom manifestations range from asymptomatic disease to severe and lethal outcomes. Lack of previous exposure and immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and high infectivity of the virus have contributed to its broad spread across the globe. In the absence of specific adaptive immunity, innate immune mechanisms are crucial for efficient antiviral defenses and control of the infection. Accumulating evidence now suggests that the remarkable heterogeneity in COVID-19 disease manifestations is due to variable degrees of impairment of innate immune mechanisms. In this review, we summarize recent findings describing both viral and host intrinsic factors that have been linked to defective innate immune responses and account for severe COVID-19. We also discuss emerging therapeutic opportunities for targeting innate immunity for the treatment of COVID-19.
