AB  - We analyze the medium-term macroeconomic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lock-down measures on low-income countries. We focus on the impact of the degradation of health and human capital caused by the pandemic and its aftermath, exploring the trade-offs between rebuilding human capital and the recovery of livelihoods and macroeconomic sustainability. A dynamic general equilibrium model is calibrated to reflect the structural characteristics of vulnerable low-income countries and to replicate key dimensions of the Covid-19 shock. We show that absent significant and sustained external financing, the persistence of loss-of-learning effects on labor productivity is likely to make the post-Covid recovery more attenuated and more expensive than many contemporary analysis suggests.

AB  - There are two key needs in COVID-19 management: (i) to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral infection rate; and (ii) to reduce death rate of those infected - the subject of this commentary. The current WHO estimated global mortality rate is 3.4% (March 2020) and the global death toll has now past 200,000 (April 2020). Without therapy the COVID-19 pandemic is escalating exponentially: from the first reported death in Wuhan China 10th January 2020, it took 91 days for the global death toll to pass 100,000 - then a further 16 days to reach 200,000. A vaccination program will take 1–2 years to roll out, once safety and efficacy is proven. Anti-virals are being sought mainly amongst repurposed drug candidates but also with combinatorial screening of libraries, for example to block virus binding angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - ACE2 providing the receptor on cells that allows viral entry. Cell-based approaches include stem cells and exosomes but these will never meet scale of need whilst also carrying risk of viral transmission if contaminated. Countries have introduced Population control with social distancing and lockdown to isolate individuals: this has reduced infectivity rate - “R” - where R denotes the average number of people an infected person will spread the illness to. But, after lockdown, the virus remains: the probability of R increasing again is high. The new danger is exit from lockdown. Here, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) represents an untapped resource to boost the lung's own resistance to developing COVID-19 - reducing risk of severe disease as nations cautiously leave lockdown to return to normality.

AB  - The WHO just released in May 2022 a report on the state of the obesity pandemic in Europe, stating that 60% of citizens in the area of Europe are either overweight or obese, and highlighting the implications of the obesity pandemic, especially as it interacts with the COVID pandemic to create a twin pandemic, to increase morbidity and mortality. Obesity is a complex disease which has reached pandemic dimensions. The worldwide prevalence of obesity has nearly tripled since 1975, mainly due to the adoption of a progressively more sedentary lifestyle and the consumption of less healthy diets. We first report herein updated prevalence rates of overweight and obesity by sex, age, and region first in Europe, per the WHO report, and then worldwide between 1980 and 2019, as we analyze and present herein the data provided by the Global Burden of Disease Study. The prevalence of obesity is higher in women than in men of any age and the prevalence of both overweight and obesity increases with age and has reached their highest point between the ages of 50 to 65 years showing a slight downward trend afterwards. The age-standardized prevalence of obesity has increased from 4.6% in 1980 to 14.0% in 2019. The American and European region have the highest obesity prevalence and the USA and Russia are the countries with the most obese residents. Given dire implications in terms of comorbidities and mortality, these updated epidemiological findings call for coordinated actions from local and regional governments, the scientific community and individual patients alike, as well as the food industry for the obesity pandemic to be controlled and alleviated. We can hopefully learn from the COVID-19 pandemic, where collaborative efforts worldwide, focused intense work at both the local and global level and well-coordinated leadership have demonstrated that humankind is capable of amazing accomplishments by leveraging science and public health, and that we can finally make strides in terms of understanding and combating the obesity pandemic and its dire comorbidities including diabetes, NAFLD, CVD and obesity associated malignancies.

AB  - Viral diseases are emerging as global threats. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has severe global impacts. Safety, dosage, and potency of vaccines recently approved for emergency use against SARS-CoV-2 need further evaluation. There is still no effective treatment against COVID-19; therefore, safe, and effective vaccines or therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. Oil-in-water nanoemulsions (O/W NEs) are emerging as sophisticated, protective, and therapeutic platforms. Encapsulation capacity, which offers better drug pharmacokinetics, coupled with the tunable surfaces present NEs as promising tools for pharmaceutical applications. The challenges facing drug discovery, and the advancements of NEs in drug delivery demonstrate the potential of NEs against evolving diseases, like COVID-19. Here we summarize current COVID-19 knowledge and discuss the composition, stability, preparation, characterization, and biological fate of O/W NEs. We also provide insights into NE structural-functional properties that may contribute to therapeutic or preventative solutions against COVID-19.

AB  - Type 2 coronavirus pandemics that is plaguing almost all the world has caused qualitative and quantitative strains in health systems that have had to be responded to. The lack of known vaccines and effective treatments has generated the need to use drugs with very little evidence for their incorporation into pharmacotherapeutic protocols agreed by the clinical team. The hospital pharmacist, within the multidisciplinary team, has been responsible for critically evaluating the alternatives and positioning them in these protocols. Finally, some ethical and legal questions that should be considered in this scenario are analyzed in this article.
Resumen
La pandemia por coronavirus tipo 2 que está azotando prácticamente todo el mundo ha provocado en los sistemas sanitarios tensiones cualitativas y cuantitativas a las que ha habido que dar respuesta. La inexistencia de vacunas y de tratamientos eficaces conocidos ha generado la necesidad de utilizar fármacos con muy escasa evidencia para su incorporación en protocolos farmacoterapéuticos consensuados por el equipo clínico. El farmacéutico de hospital, dentro del equipo multidisciplinar, ha sido en muchas ocasiones el responsable de evaluar críticamente las alternativas para su posicionamiento en estos protocolos. Se analizan en el presente artículo algunas cuestiones éticas y legales que deben ser consideradas en este escenario.

AB  - Dawn to sunset fasting, a type of intermittent fasting commonly practiced in the month of Ramadan, requires abstinence from food and drink from dawn to sunset. Dawn and dusk are two transition time zones of the day that play a critical role in the human circadian rhythm. Practicing dawn to sunset fasting requires the alignment of mealtimes and wake-sleep times with the human biological dawn and dusk. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) impairs immune cell responses at multiple levels and leads to severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). It generates high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, also known as a cytokine storm, leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and generation of excessive amounts of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, downregulates autophagy to escape detection for unchecked replication, and alters gut microbiome composition. Severe cases of COVID-19 have been associated with several comorbidities that impair immune responses (e.g., obesity, diabetes, malignancy) and blood laboratory abnormalities (e.g., elevated procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, leukocytosis, lymphopenia). Several studies of dawn to sunset fasting showed anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing several pro-inflammatory cytokines, reducing oxidative stress, inducing a proteome response associated with increased autophagy, remodeling the gut microbiome, and improving the components of metabolic syndrome (e.g., obesity, blood glucose levels, blood pressure, lipids). In conclusion, dawn to sunset fasting has the potential to optimize the immune system function against SARS‐CoV‐2 during the COVID-19 pandemic as it suppresses chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, improves metabolic profile, and remodels the gut microbiome. This review presents scientific literature related to the effects of dawn to sunset fasting on the immune system. Studies are needed to assess and confirm the potential benefits of dawn to sunset fasting against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Background
Vaccine Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare complication following ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca) vaccination. Venous thrombosis in unusual sites such as splachnic or intracranial thrombosis, is the commonest manifestation.
Case report
We report a 35-year-old male patient who presented with acute left leg ischemia and thrombocytopenia 11-days after vaccination requiring emergent thrombectomy. During work-up, a localized thrombus was detected in the left carotid bifurcation mandating carotid thrombectomy. Localized right iliac thrombus causing a non-limiting flow stenosis was treated conservatively. The platelet aggregating capacity of patient's plasma was confirmed in a functional assay, thereby establishing VITT.
Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge this is the first case presenting multiple arterial thromboses requiring surgical treatment after ChAdOx1 vaccination.

AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been recognized as a potential entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 allows engagement with pulmonary epithelial cells and pulmonary infection with the virus. ACE2 is an essential component of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and involved in promoting protective effects to counter-regulate angiotensin (Ang) II-induced pathogenesis. The use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) was implicitly negated during the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic, considering the role of these antihypertensive agents in enhancing ACE2 expression thereby promoting the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. However, no clinical data has supported this assumption, but indeed evidence demonstrates that ACEIs and ARBs, besides their cardioprotective effects in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular diseases, might also be beneficial in acute lung injuries by preserving the ACE2 function and switching the balance from deleterious ACE/Ang II/AT1 receptor axis towards a protective ACE2/Ang (1–7)/Mas receptor axis.

AB  - Introduction
There are few published empirical data on the effects of COVID‐19 on mental health, and until now, there is no large international study.
Material and methods
During the COVID-19 pandemic, an online questionnaire gathered data from 55,589 participants from 40 countries (64.85% females aged 35.80 ± 13.61; 34.05% males aged 34.90±13.29 and 1.10% other aged 31.64±13.15). Distress and probable depression were identified with the use of a previously developed cut-off and algorithm respectively.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated. Chi-square tests, multiple forward stepwise linear regression analyses and Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tested relations among variables.
Results
Probable depression was detected in 17.80% and distress in 16.71%. A significant percentage reported a deterioration in mental state, family dynamics and everyday lifestyle. Persons with a history of mental disorders had higher rates of current depression (31.82% vs. 13.07%). At least half of participants were accepting (at least to a moderate degree) a non-bizarre conspiracy. The highest Relative Risk (RR) to develop depression was associated with history of Bipolar disorder and self-harm/attempts (RR = 5.88). Suicidality was not increased in persons without a history of any mental disorder. Based on these results a model was developed.
Conclusions
The final model revealed multiple vulnerabilities and an interplay leading from simple anxiety to probable depression and suicidality through distress. This could be of practical utility since many of these factors are modifiable. Future research and interventions should specifically focus on them.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an unprecedented disease caused by highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 and characterized by extreme respiratory deterrence, pneumonia and immune damage. The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the sequence similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other SARS-like bat viruses. The primary source and intermediate host are not yet confirmed, although transmission from human to human is universally confirmed. The new SARS-CoV-2 virus reaches cells via ACE-2 and subsequently down-regulates ACE-2, leaving angiotensin II unbalanced in affected organs primarily in the lungs, heart, brain, and kidneys. As reported recently, numerous secondary complications i.e., neurological, nephrological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune, and hepatic complications, are associated with COVID-19 infection along with prominent respiratory disease including pneumonia. Extensive research work on recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 is in the pipeline to clarify pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiological features, and identify new drug targets that will lead to the development of successful strategies for prevention and treatment. There are currently no appropriate scientifically approved vaccines/drugs for COVID-19. Nonetheless, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, azithromycin were tested against COVID-19 in clinical trials, and finally, FDA approved emergency use of remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Additionally, administration of convalescent plasma obtained from recovered COVID-19 patients to infected COVID-19 patients reduces the viral burden via immunomodulation. This review analysis therefore concentrates primarily on recent discoveries related to COVID-19 pathogenesis along with a full description of the structure, genome, and secondary complication associated with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, a short and brief clinical update has been provided concerning the development of therapeutic medications and vaccines to counter COVID-19.

AB  - Brazil has become one of the epicentres of the COVID-19 pandemic, with cases heavily concentrated in large cities. Testing data is extremely limited and unreliable, which restricts health authorities’ ability to deal with the pandemic. Given the stark demographic, social and economic heterogeneities within Brazilian cities, it is important to identify hotspots so that the limited resources available can have the greatest impact. This study shows that decentralised monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage can be used to assess the distribution of COVID-19 prevalence in the city. The methodology developed in this study allowed the identification of hotspots by comprehensively monitoring sewers distributed through Belo Horizonte, Brazil's third largest city. Our results show that the most vulnerable neighbourhoods in the city were the hardest hit by the pandemic, indicating that, for many Brazilians, the situation is much worse than reported by official figures.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the development trajectories of several world economies with India being no exception. The country presently is the second worst affected in terms of total infections despite inducing a nationwide lockdown in the initial stages. In addition to curtailing infection spread, ensuring food security during and post pandemic is a major concern for the country owing to the high percentage of stunting and undernourishment already present and a relatively high proportion of vulnerable workforce with no regular source of income amidst the lockdown. The present article therefore ascertains the impact of the pandemic on the food systems which can potentially affect food security in the country as well as the government introduced reforms and policy measures to tackle them. Following the analysis, we suggest measures like digitally enhancing connectivity of neighbourhood retail or ‘Kirana’ stores in urban and rural areas, distribution of therapeutic foods and immune supplements among the impoverished societal sections through existing government schemes and promotion of ‘planetary healthy diets’ for overcoming food-insecurity while increasing nutrition security and ensuring long term food sector sustainability.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has forever changed how we view health care service delivery. Although there are undoubtedly some unintended consequences that will result from current health care service reallocation, it provides a unique opportunity to consider how to deliver quality care currently, and after the pandemic. In the context of lessons learned, moving forward some of what was previously routine could remain reserved for more exceptional circumstances. To determine what is “routine,” what is “essential,” and what is “exceptional,” it is necessary to view medical decisions within the paradigm of high-quality care. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement definition of the dimensions of quality is based on whether the care is safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable. This type of stewardship has been applied to many interventions already deemed unnecessary by organizations such as the Choosing Wisely initiative, but the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic provides a lens from which to consider other aspects of care. The following will provide examples from Allergy/Immunology that outline how we can reconsider what quality means in the post–coronavirus disease health care system.

AB  - Purpose
To review the scientific literature seeking lessons for the COVID-19 era that could be learned from previous health services interruptions that affected the delivery of cancer screening services.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted up to April 17, 2020, with no restrictions on language or dates and resulted in 385 articles. Two researchers independently assessed the list and discussed any disagreements. Once a consensus was achieved for each paper, those selected were included in the review.
Results
Eleven articles were included. Three studies were based in Japan, two in the United States, one in South Korea, one in Denmark, and the remaining four offered a global perspective on interruptions in health services due to natural or human-caused disasters. No articles covered an interruption due to a pandemic. The main themes identified in the reviewed studies were coordination, communication, resource availability and patient follow-up.
Conclusion
Lessons learned applied to the context of COVID-19 are that coordination involving partners across the health sector is essential to optimize resources and resume services, making them more resilient while preparing for future interruptions. Communication with the general population about how COVID-19 has affected cancer screening, measures taken to mitigate it and safely re-establish screening services is recommended. Use of mobile health systems to reach patients who are not accessing services and the application of resource-stratified guidelines are important considerations. More research is needed to explore best strategies for suspending, resuming and sustaining cancer screening programs, and preparedness for future disruptions, adapted to diverse health care systems.

AB  - Background
Patients with COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 exhibit diverse clinical manifestations and severity including enteric involvement. Commensal gut bacteria can contribute to defense against potential pathogens by promoting beneficial immune interactions. Interventions targeting the gut microbiome may have systemic anti-viral effects in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Scope and approach
To summarise alterations of gut microbiota in patients with COVID-19 including impact of specific bacteria on disease severity, discuss current knowledge on the role of probiotics, prebiotics and dietary approaches including vitamin D in preventing and reducing disease susceptibility and review clinical studies using probiotics to target coronavirus. A literature review on SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, gut microbiome and immunity was undertaken and relevant literature was summarised and critically examined.
Key findings and conclusions
Integrity of gut microbiome was perturbed in SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated with disease severity. Poor prognosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed in subjects with underlying co-morbidities who had increased gut permeability and reduced gut microbiome diversity. Dietary microbes, including probiotics or selected prebiotics of Chinese origin, had anti-viral effects against other forms of coronavirus, and could positively impact host immune functions during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous studies are investigating the role of probiotics in preventing and reducing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers, household contacts and affected patients. An approach to strengthen intestinal barrier and lower pro-inflammatory states by adopting a more diversified diet during COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with immune dysfunction and gut microbiota alterations. Delineating mechanisms of probiotics, prebiotics and diet with anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity present opportunities for discovery of microbial therapeutics to prevent and treat COVID-19.

AB  - Screening can decrease the burden of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. The COVID-19 pandemic led many countries to suspend cancer screening services as part of their response to the pandemic. The International Cancer Screening Network (ICSN) carried out an online survey to assess the effects of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer screening. A 33-item survey was distributed to 834 email addresses to gather information about settings and assess decision-making processes that led to cancer screening suspension. Information about communication, impact on resources, and patient follow-up was collected. Quantitative data was analyzed as frequencies overall and by setting, while a comment section under each survey item captured nuanced details. Responses were recategorized into 66 settings, representing 35 countries. Most settings suspended cancer screening services (n = 60, 90.9%) in March 2020 (n = 45, 68.2%), guided by a government decision (n = 51, 77.3%). Few settings made the decision whether to suspend services based on a preparedness plan (n = 17, 25.8%). In most settings, professionals were reassigned (n = 41, 62.1%) and infrastructure repurposed (n = 35, 53.0%). The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on cancer screening worldwide, including the suspension of services in almost all settings. Most settings were unprepared to deal with the scale of the pandemic but demonstrated flexibility in the response. These results contribute to inform, through experiences and lessons learned, the next steps for the global cancer screening community to further evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and prepare for future disruptions.

AB  - The worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has continued to accelerate, putting a considerable burden on public health, safety, and the global economy. Taking into consideration that the main route of virus transmission is via respiratory particles, the face mask represents a simple and efficient barrier between potentially infected and healthy individuals, thus reducing transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected respiratory particles. However, long-term usage of a face mask leads to the accumulation of significant amounts of different pathogens and viruses onto the surface of the mask and can result in dangerous bacterial and viral co-infections. Zeolite imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) has recently emerged as an efficient water-stable photocatalyst capable of generating reactive oxygen species under light irradiation destroying dangerous microbial pathogens. The present study investigates the potential of using ZIF-8 as a coating for face masks to prevent the adherence of microbial/viral entities. The results show that after 2 h of UV irradiation, a polypropylene mask coated with ZIF-8 nanostructures is capable of eliminating S. Aureus and bacteriophage MS2 with 99.99% and 95.4% efficiencies, respectively. Furthermore, low-pathogenic HCoV-OC43 coronavirus was eliminated by a ZIF-8-modified mask with 100% efficiency already after 1 h of UV irradiation. As bacteriophage MS2 and HCoV-OC43 coronavirus are commonly used surrogates of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the revealed antiviral properties of ZIF-8 can represent an important step in designing efficient protective equipment for controlling and fighting the current COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background
In China, there are few studies that have reported future estimations for cancer mortality. Therefore, this study aimed to assess cancer mortality in China and identify priorities for future cancer control strategies.
Methods
Based on the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study, we extracted data on cancer-related deaths from 1990 to 2019 in Hunan Province, China. Under the current trends evaluated using a joinpoint regression model, we fitted a linear regression model for cancer mortality projections by 2025.
Results
The age-standardized mortality rate of total cancer in Hunan, China, declined slowly and is projected to be 140.80 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 140.12–141.48) by 2025, with the mortality rate in men approximately twice that in women. In 2025, the top five causes of cancer-related deaths in males are projected to be lung, liver, colorectal, stomach, and esophageal cancers, with the corresponding causes in females being lung, breast, colorectal, liver, and cervical cancers. Between 2019 and 2025, male mortality rates due to liver and pancreatic cancer are expected to increase, while those due to the six leading female cancers will increase. Excess male deaths were associated with liver and esophageal cancers, while all main cancers in females will have excess mortality, except for colorectal cancer.
Conclusion
A comprehensive cancer spectrum characteristic of both developing and developed countries will remain in Hunan, China. Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer-related deaths, and tobacco control efforts are urgently required. Additional efforts should be made to promote universal screening, improve access to cancer healthcare services, optimize medical payment models, and enhance access to valuable anticancer drugs.

AB  - Soon after reports of a novel coronavirus capable of causing severe pneumonia surfaced in late 2019, expeditious global spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) forced the World Health Organization to declare an international state of emergency. Although best known for causing symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection in mild cases and fulminant pneumonia in severe disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has also been associated with gastrointestinal, neurologic, cardiac, and hematologic presentations. Despite concerns over poor specificity and undue radiation exposure, chest imaging nonetheless remains central to the initial diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 progression, as well as to the evaluation of complications. Classic features on chest CT include ground-glass and reticular opacities with or without superimposed consolidations, frequently presenting in a bilateral, peripheral, and posterior distribution. More recently, studies conducted with MRI have shown excellent concordance with chest CT in visualizing typical features of COVID-19 pneumonia. For patients in whom exposure to ionizing radiation should be avoided, particularly pregnant patients and children, pulmonary MRI may represent a suitable alternative to chest CT. Although PET imaging is not typically considered among first-line investigative modalities for the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections, numerous reports have noted incidental localization of radiotracer in parenchymal regions of COVID-19-associated pulmonary lesions. These findings are consistent with data from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV cohorts which suggested an ability for 18F-FDG PET to detect subclinical infection and lymphadenitis in subjects without overt clinical signs of infection. Though highly sensitive, use of PET/CT for primary detection of COVID-19 is constrained by poor specificity, as well as considerations of cost, radiation burden, and prolonged exposure times for imaging staff. Even still, decontamination of scanner bays is a time-consuming process, and proper ventilation of scanner suites may additionally require up to an hour of downtime to allow for sufficient air exchange. Yet, in patients who require nuclear medicine investigations for other clinical indications, PET imaging may yield the earliest detection of nascent infection in otherwise asymptomatic individuals. Especially for patients with concomitant malignancies and other states of immunocompromise, prompt recognition of infection and early initiation of supportive care is crucial to maximizing outcomes and improving survivability.

AB  - This paper analyses the risk-adjusted performance of Islamic and conventional equity funds during the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that Islamic equity funds demonstrated differentials in risk-adjusted performance, investment styles, and volatility timing compared to their conventional counterparts. Specifically, the results revealed that Islamic equity funds are more resilient to COVID-19 shock since they outperformed non-Islamic peers during the peak months of the pandemic. The trend continues even when the spread smoothens. These findings confirm the safe-haven properties of Islamic equity funds, which is helpful for investors aiming to hedge pandemic risks. The style analysis reveals investment drift from riskier styles to more prudent options in response to each stage's uncertainties. The results suggest policymakers should further investigate Islamic financial assets and their underlying principles to improve the resilience of economic systems in any future black swan events.

AB  - Summary
Background
As of December 31, 2020, Brazil had the second-highest burden of COVID-19 worldwide. Given the absence of federal government coordination, it was up to the local governments to maintain healthcare provision for non-COVID health issues. In this descriptive study, we aimed to discuss the SUS functionality and resilience, describing the impact of the pandemic on non-COVID health services delivery while considering the regional inequalities of the allocation of financing health system, health infrastructure and health workforce.
Methods
We used input-output framework based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Health System Building Blocks to estimate health system functionality and resilience. An ecological assessment was designed to calculated mean relative changes to compare the first year of the pandemic in Brazil with the previous one. All data used in this study were anonymized and made available by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Input indicators were categorized in health system financing (federal funding received as well as expenditure of both state and city governments), health system's infrastructure (hospital beds) and health workforce (healthcare workers positions). Output indicators were categorized into nine different groups of service delivery procedures. To explore the relationship between the variation in procedures with socioeconomic conditions, we used the Socioeconomic Vulnerability Index (SVI).
Findings
State governments had a 38·6% increase in federal transfers, while municipal governments had a 33·9% increase. The increase of ICU beds reached its peak in the third quarter of 2020, averaging 72·1% by the end of the year. The country also saw an increase in jobs for registered nurses (13·6%), nurse assistants (8·5%), physiotherapists (7·9%), and medical doctors (4·9%). All procedures underwent expressive reduction: Screenings (−42·6%); Diagnostic procedures (−28·9%); Physician appointments (−42·5%); Low and medium complexity surgeries (−59·7%); High complexity surgeries (−27·9%); Transplants (−44·7%); Treatments and clinical procedures due to injuries of external causes (−19·1%); Irrepressible procedures (−8·5%); and Childbirths (−12·6%). The most significant drop in procedures happened in the first quarter of the pandemic, followed by progressive increase; most regions had not yet recovered by the end of 2020. State-level changes in numbers of procedures point towards a negative trend with SVI.
Interpretation
The Brazilian Government did not consider that socioeconomically vulnerable states were at a higher risk of being impacted by the overburden of the health system caused by the COVID-19, which resulted in poorer health system functionality for those vulnerable states. The lack of proper planning to improve health system resilience resulted in the decrease of a quarter of the amount of healthcare procedures increasing the already existing health disparities in the country.

AB  - Background
In times of health resource reallocation, capacities must remain able to meet a continued demand for essential, nonambulatory neurosurgical acute care. This study sought to characterize the demand for and provision of neurosurgical acute care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
Methods
This single-center cross-sectional observational analysis compared nonambulatory neurosurgical consult encounters during the peri-surge period (March 9 to May 31, 2020) with those during an analogous period in 2019. Outcomes included consult volume, distribution of problem types, disease severity, and rate of acute operative intervention.
Results
A total of 1494 neurosurgical consults were analyzed. Amidst the pandemic surge, 583 consults were seen, which was 6.4 standard deviations below the mean among analogous 2016–2019 periods (mean 873; standard deviation 45, P = 0.001). Between 2019 and 2020, the proportion of degenerative spine consults decreased in favor of spinal trauma (25.6% vs. 34% and 51.9% vs. 41.4%, P = 0.088). Among aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage cases, poor-grade (Hunt and Hess grades 4–5) presentations were more common (30% vs. 14.8%, P = 0.086). A greater proportion of pandemic era consults resulted in acute operative management, with an unchanged absolute frequency of acutely operative consults (123/583 [21.1%] vs. 120/911 [13.2%], P < 0.001).
Conclusions
Neurosurgical consult volume during the pandemic surge hit a 5-year institutional low. Amidst vast reallocation of health care resources, demand for high-acuity nonambulatory neurosurgical care continued and proportionally increased for greater-acuity pathologies. In our continued current pandemic as well as any future situations of mass health resource reallocation, neurosurgical acute care capacities must be preserved.

AB  - Background & Aim
Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), specifically those treated with anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α biologics, are at high risk for vaccine-preventable infections. Their ability to mount adequate vaccine responses is unclear. The aim of the study was to assess serologic responses to messenger RNA–Coronavirus Disease 2019 vaccine, and safety profile, in patients with IBD stratified according to therapy, compared with healthy controls (HCs).
Methods
Prospective, controlled, multicenter Israeli study. Subjects enrolled received 2 BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) doses. Anti-spike antibody levels and functional activity, anti-TNFα levels and adverse events (AEs) were detected longitudinally.
Results
Overall, 258 subjects: 185 IBD (67 treated with anti-TNFα, 118 non–anti-TNFα), and 73 HCs. After the first vaccine dose, all HCs were seropositive, whereas ∼7% of patients with IBD, regardless of treatment, remained seronegative. After the second dose, all subjects were seropositive, however anti-spike levels were significantly lower in anti-TNFα treated compared with non–anti-TNFα treated patients, and HCs (both P < .001). Neutralizing and inhibitory functions were both lower in anti-TNFα treated compared with non–anti-TNFα treated patients, and HCs (P < .03; P < .0001, respectively). Anti-TNFα drug levels and vaccine responses did not affect anti-spike levels. Infection rate (∼2%) and AEs were comparable in all groups. IBD activity was unaffected by BNT162b2.
Conclusions
In this prospective study in patients with IBD stratified according to treatment, all patients mounted serologic response to 2 doses of BNT162b2; however, its magnitude was significantly lower in patients treated with anti-TNFα, regardless of administration timing and drug levels. Vaccine was safe. As vaccine serologic response longevity in this group may be limited, vaccine booster dose should be considered.

AB  - The two genetically similar severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, have each been responsible for global epidemics of vastly different scales. Although both viruses arose from similar origins, they quickly diverged due to differences in their transmission dynamics and spectrum of clinical presentations. The potential involvement of multiple organs systems, including the respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal and neurological, during infection necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the clinical pathogenesis of each virus. The management of COVID-19, initially modelled after SARS and other respiratory illnesses, has continued to evolve as we accumulate more knowledge and experience during the pandemic, as well as develop new therapeutics and vaccines. The impact of these two coronaviruses has been profound for our health care and public health systems, and we hope that the lessons learned will not only bring the current pandemic under control, but also prevent and reduce the impact of future pandemics.

AB  - Although COVID-19 emerged as a global shock, governments adopted non-pharmaceutical policy responses that were rather heterogeneous, depending on cultural and institutional characteristics. At the country level, the stringency of ‘lockdown’-type policies should be set to achieve the best possible trade-off between economic and fatality dynamics, obviously accounting for possible cross-border influences. To allow for policy learning, I assume that the first country implementing a policy initiative that is worth emulating must either get the best possible health or the best possible economic outcome. I propose a combination of sign and magnitude restrictions, embedded in a global VAR model, to identify idiosyncratic policy shocks that spill over and influence policy responses abroad. Once policy shocks are identified, I run a comparison exercise between two model specifications, i.e. with and without policy emulation. Within a given a sample, this methodology can be used to find when and where policy lessons can be identified. I find that, among 17 developed and developing countries, few can offer lessons based on their policy initiatives, but several others might get better trade-offs through policy emulation, although in reality this outcome is not guaranteed to have occurred.

AB  - Due to the unprecedented public health crisis caused by COVID-19, our first contribution to the newly launching journal, Advances in Biomarker Sciences and Technology, has abruptly diverted to focus on the current pandemic. As the number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise steadily around the world, the common goal of healthcare providers, scientists, and government officials worldwide has been to identify the best way to detect the novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, and to treat the viral infection – COVID-19. Accurate detection, timely diagnosis, effective treatment, and future prevention are the vital keys to management of COVID-19, and can help curb the viral spread. Traditionally, biomarkers play a pivotal role in the early detection of disease etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. To assist myriad ongoing investigations and innovations, we developed this current article to overview known and emerging biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 detection, COVID-19 diagnostics, treatment and prognosis, and ongoing work to identify and develop more biomarkers for new drugs and vaccines. Moreover, biomarkers of socio-psychological stress, the high-technology quest for new virtual drug screening, and digital applications are described.

AB  - Background
The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has disrupted the delivery of safe surgical care worldwide. One specific aspect of global surgical care that has been severely limited is the ability for physicians and trainees to participate in global surgical outreach programs in low- and middle-income countries.
Methods
A narrative review of the literature regarding global surgical outreach programs during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic was performed. Factors that must be considered in the reinstatement of global surgical outreach programs were identified, and suggestions to address them were provided based on the available literature and the experiences of the senior authors.
Results
As global surgical outreach programs were canceled at the start of the pandemic, many academic surgeons turned to digital solutions to continue to engage with low- and middle-income country partners. With the advent of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines and improved access to testing and treatment worldwide, the recommencement of global surgical outreach programs may begin to be considered. Important considerations before initiation include vaccine and testing availability for visiting providers, local staff, and patients, local hospital capacity, staff and equipment shortages, and the characteristics of the patient population and visiting providers. Region- and country-specific factors, including local infection rates and concomitant health crises, must also be taken into account. Expansion of digital collaborative efforts may further deepen international connections and promote sustainable models of care.
Conclusion
With careful consideration, global surgical outreach programs may begin to be safely restarted in the near future. The current article evaluates individual factors that must be considered to safely restart global surgical outreach programs as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is better controlled.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 causes coronavirus disease 2019, a pandemic which was originated from Wuhan city of China. The pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a cytokine storm in the blood (cytokinemia) and tissues, especially the lungs. One of the major repercussions of this inflammatory process is the endothelial injury-causing intestinal bleeding, coagulopathy, and thromboembolism which result in various sudden and unexpected post-COVID complications including kidney failure, myocardial infarction, or multiorgan failure. In this review, we have summarized the immune responses, biochemical changes, and inflammatory responses in the human body after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The increased amount of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and involvement of complement proteins in inflammatory reaction increase the risk of occurrence of disease.

AB  - Innate immunity is the first line of host defense against microbes, including SARS-CoV-2. This pleiotropic immunological mechanism is initiated within minutes to hours after infection. Here, we summarize innate immune processes involved in SARS-CoV-2 recognition, cellular, and molecular response including inflammation, as well as the related immune modulatory therapies that have been evaluated in clinical trials for COVID-19. Innate immune responses limit viral replication, help identify and remove infected cells, sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns, trigger signaling pathways, inflammatory responses, cytokine production, programmed cell death, and contribute the development of adaptive immunity. Excessive activation of the host innate immune response is associated with severe disease and death. The availability and speed of implementation of these mechanisms in infected individuals may explain in part the heterogeneous disease spectrum and courses observed in patients.

AB  - Complement is integral to a healthy functioning immune system and orchestrates various innate and adaptive responses against viruses and other pathogens. Despite its importance, the potential beneficial role of complement in immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been overshadowed by reports of extensive complement activation in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Here, we hypothesize that complement may also have a protective role and could function to enhance virus neutralization by antibodies, promote virus phagocytosis by immune cells, and lysis of virus. These functions might be exploited in the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The global scope of pollution from plastic waste is a well-known phenomenon associated with trade, mass consumption, and disposal of plastic products (e.g., personal protective equipment (PPE), viral test kits, and vacuum-packaged food). Recently, the scale of the problem has been exacerbated by increases in indoor livelihood activities during lockdowns imposed in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The present study describes the effects of increased plastic waste on environmental footprint and human health. Further, the technological/regulatory options and life cycle assessment (LCA) approach for sustainable plastic waste management are critically dealt in terms of their implications on energy resilience and circular economy. The abrupt increase in health-care waste during pandemic has been worsening environmental quality to undermine the sustainability in general. In addition, weathered plastic particles from PPE along with microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) can all adsorb chemical and microbial contaminants to pose a risk to ecosystems, biota, occupational safety, and human health. PPE-derived plastic pollution during the pandemic also jeopardizes sustainable development goals, energy resilience, and climate control measures. However, it is revealed that the pandemic can be regarded as an opportunity for explicit LCA to better address the problems associated with environmental footprints of plastic waste and to focus on sustainable management technologies such as circular bio-economies, biorefineries, and thermal gasification. Future researches in the energy-efficient clean technologies and circular bio-economies (or biorefineries) in concert with a “nexus” framework are expected to help reduce plastic waste into desirable directions.

AB  - Using the Irish experience of the 1918–1919 Spanish flu pandemic (“Influenza-18”), we demonstrate how pandemic mortality statistics can be sensitive to the demographic composition of a country. We build a new spatially disaggregated population database for Ireland’s 32 counties for 1911–1920 with vital statistics on births, ageing, migration and deaths. Our principal contribution is to show why, and how, age-at-death data should be used to construct the age-standardised statistics necessary to make meaningful comparisons of mortality rates across time and space. We conclude that studies of the economic consequences of pandemics must better control for demographic factors if they are to yield useful policy-relevant insights. For example, while Northern Ireland had a higher crude death rate during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, it also has an older population; age-adjusted mortality paints a very different picture.

AB  - Former studies have revealed intersex variability in immune response to infectious diseases, including Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological surveillance of the ongoing pandemic has demonstrated a male vulnerability to morbidity and mortality, despite similar infection rates between the two sexes. Divergence in the frequency of comorbidities between males and females, differences in hormonal profile, chromosomal composition and gender behavior have all been proposed as potential causative factors. Data deriving from the immunization process indirectly support the existence of a sex-specific response to SARS-CoV-2, since females apparently produce higher numbers of antibodies while simultaneously exhibiting higher rates of side effects, indicating a stronger immune reactivity to the vaccine's elements. Interpreting intersex differences in immune response to SARS-CoV-2 could lead to a deeper understanding of the COVID-19 pathophysiology and enable healthcare professionals to conduct a more accurate patient risk assessment and better predict the clinical outcome of the disease. This narrative review aims to discuss the pathophysiological and behavioral basis of the disproportionate male morbidity and mortality observed in COVID-19, in the context of most research findings in the field.

AB  - Background:A number of estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) of SARS-CoV-2 in different countries have been published. In Brazil, the fragile political situation, together with socioeconomic and ethnic diversity, could result in substantially different IFR estimates. Methods:We infer the IFR in Brazil in 2020 by combining three datasets. We compute the prevalence via the population-based seroprevalence survey, EPICOVID19-BR. For the fatalities we obtain the absolute number using the public Painel Coronavírus dataset and the age-relative number using the public SIVEP-Gripe dataset. The time delay between the development of antibodies and subsequent fatality is estimated via the SIVEP-Gripe dataset. We obtain the IFR for each survey stage and 27 federal states. We include the effect of fading IgG antibody levels by marginalizing over the test detectability time window. Results:We infer a country-wide average IFR (maximum posterior and 95% CI) of 1.03% (0.88–1.22%) and age-specific IFRs of 0.032% (0.023–0.041%) [< 30 years], 0.22% (0.18–0.27%) [30–49 years], 1.2% (1.0–1.5%) [50–69 years], and 3.0% (2.4–3.9%) [≥ 70 years]. We find that the fatality ratio in the country increased significantly at the end of June 2020, likely due to the increased strain on the health system. Conclusions: Our IFR estimate is based on data and does not rely on extrapolating models. This estimate sets a baseline value with which future medications and treatment protocols may be confronted.

AB  - With the emergence of COVID-19 vaccines, individuals with comorbidities and immunosuppression require particular attention and should be prioritized for vaccination. However, the majority of vaccine clinical trials excluded people with comorbidities, resulting in a lack of data regarding vaccine efficacy in this demographic. Along with more inclusivity in clinical trials, reaching a definitive conclusion regarding vaccine efficacy in these patients is also crucial. In our review, we highlight the BNT162b2 vaccine safety and efficacy based on the limited number of clinical trials which included this demographic. We also provide vaccine considerations for individuals with cancer, autoimmune diseases, HIV, obesity, diabetes, organ transplant recipients and those undergoing maintenance haemodialysis to help them govern their decision regarding vaccine administration. In conclusion, further studies are required to alleviate any insecurities in patients with comorbidities regarding vaccination and it is recommended that patients are monitored post-vaccination to make sure sufficient immunity is achieved.

AB  - Background and aims
Balanced nutrition which can help in maintaining immunity is essential for prevention and management of viral infections. While data regarding nutrition in coronavirus infection (COVID-19) are not available, in this review, we aimed to evaluate evidence from previous clinical trials that studied nutrition-based interventions for viral diseases (with special emphasis on respiratory infections), and summarise our observations.
Methods
A systematic search strategy was employed using keywords to search the literature in 3 key medical databases: PubMed®, Web of Science® and SciVerse Scopus®. Studies were considered eligible if they were controlled trials in humans, measuring immunological parameters, on viral and respiratory infections. Clinical trials on vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals and probiotics were included.
Results
A total of 640 records were identified initially and 22 studies were included from other sources. After excluding duplicates and articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 43 studies were obtained (vitamins: 13; minerals: 8; nutraceuticals: 18 and probiotics: 4). Among vitamins, A and D showed a potential benefit, especially in deficient populations. Among trace elements, selenium and zinc have also shown favourable immune-modulatory effects in viral respiratory infections. Several nutraceuticals and probiotics may also have some role in enhancing immune functions. Micronutrients may be beneficial in nutritionally depleted elderly population.
Conclusions
We summaries possible benefits of some vitamins, trace elements, nutraceuticals and probiotics in viral infections. Nutrition principles based on these data could be useful in possible prevention and management of COVID-19

AB  - The SARS-2 pandemic which has moved with frightening speed over the last 5 months has several synergies with another older, and far more neglected airborne disease, tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis are not only more likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 but also likely to have adverse outcomes once infected. The sequelae of more severe forms of COVID-19 in patients who have recovered from TB but have residual compromised lung function, are also likely to be devastating. These diseases share almost identical bio-social determinants like poverty, overcrowding, diabetes and pollution and some clinical similarities. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our global response to it with lockdowns, are likely to leave a profound and long-lasting impact on TB diagnosis and control, potentially leading to an additional 6.3 million cases of TB between 2020 and 2025, and an additional 1.4 million TB deaths during this time. Novel solutions will need to be urgently devised or else TB control targets will never be met and indeed may be set back by 5–8 years.

KW  - Horizontal lockdowns
KW  - Hospital preparedness
AB  - COVID-19 pandemic mitigation strategies are mainly based on social distancing measures and healthcare system reinforcement. However, many countries in Europe and elsewhere implemented strict, horizontal lockdowns because of extensive viral spread in the community which challenges the capacity of the healthcare systems. However, strict lockdowns have various untintended adverse social, economic and health effects, which have yet to be fully elucidated, and have not been considered in models examining the effects of various mitigation measures. Unlike commonly suggested, the dilemma is not about health vs wealth because the economic devastation of long-lasting lockdowns will definitely have adverse health effects in the population. Furthermore, they cannot provide a lasting solution in pandemic containment, potentially resulting in a vicious cycle of consecutive lockdowns with in-between breaks. Hospital preparedness has been the main strategy used by governments. However, a major characteristic of the COVID-19 pandemic is the rapid viral transmission in populations with no immunity. Thus, even the best hospital system could not cope with the demand. Primary, community and home care are the only viable strategies that could achieve the goal of pandemic mitigation. We present the case example of Greece, a country which followed a strategy focused on hospital preparedness but failed to reinforce primary and community care. This, along with strategic mistakes in epidemiological surveillance, resulted in Greece implementing a second strict, horizontal lockdown and having one of the highest COVID-19 death rates in Europe during the second wave. We provide recommendations for measures that will reinstate primary and community care at the forefront in managing the current public health crisis by protecting hospitals from unnecessary admissions, providing primary and secondary prevention services in relation to COVID-19 and maintaining population health through treatment of non−COVID-19 conditions. This, together with more selective social distancing measures (instead of horizontal lockdowns), represents the only viable and realistic long-term strategy for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation.

This article identifies and delineates a way forward for companies to support resilience, particularly recognizing the wider communities they are nested in and the resources that exist there. To identify such productive resources, known as capitals, we provide a novel and actionable integrated capitals framework (ICF). ICF integrates 10 existing frameworks drawn from both practice and academia and is comprised of nine different forms of capital that businesses can leverage and contribute toward supporting resilience. We provide insights into how businesses can use this framework to achieve resilience through this useful, yet underutilized, path.

AB  - Background
The European Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimates that seasonal influenzacauses 4–50 million symptomatic infections in the EU/EEA each year and 15,000–70,000 European citizens die of causes associated with influenza. We used modelling methods to estimate influenza-associated mortality for the European Union by age group and country.
Methods
We compiled influenza-associated respiratory mortality estimates for 31 countries around the world (11 countries in the EU) during 2002–2011 (excluding the 2009 pandemic). From these we extrapolated the influenza mortality burden for all 193 countries of the world, including the 28 countries of the EU, using a multiple imputation approach. To study the effect of vaccination programs, we obtained data from the EU-funded VENICE project regarding the percentage of persons over 65 who were vaccinated in each country; the data ranged from 2% to 82% between the 21 countries which provided estimates for the 2006/07 reference season.
Results
We estimated that an average of 27,600 (range 16,200-39,000) respiratory deaths were associated with seasonal influenza in the 28 EU countries per winter; 88% were among people 65 years and older, and the rates of mortality in this age group were roughly 35 times higher compared with those < 65 years. Estimates varied considerably across the EU; for example, rates in the elderly ranged from 21.6 (12.5–35.1) per 100,000 in Portugal to 36.5 (16.4–62.5) in Luxembourg, a difference of nearly 70%. We were unable to find a negative correlation between vaccination coverage rates and influenza-associated mortality estimates in the elderly.
Conclusion
Our EU estimate of influenza-associated respiratory mortality is broadly consistent with the ECDC estimate. More research is needed to explain the observed variation in mortality across the EU, and on possible bias that could explain the unexpected lack of mortality benefits associated with European elderly influenza vaccination programs.

AB  - We have considered some of the available evidence to account for the impact of SARS-CoV on the regulatory control of the autonomic nervous and respiratory systems. Apart from stimulating general interest in the subject, our hope was to provide putative explanations for some of the patients' symptoms based on described physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms seen in other diseases. Herein, we have focused on the carotid bodies. In this hypothetical viewpoint, we have discussed the plasticity of the carotid body chemoreflex and made a comparison between acute and chronic exposures to high altitude with COVID-19. From these discussions, we have postulated that the sensitivity of the hypoxic ventilatory response may well determine the outcome of disease severity and those that live at high altitude may be more resistant. We have provided insight into silent hypoxia and attempted to explain an absence of ventilatory drive and anxiety yet maintenance of consciousness. In an attempt to discover more about the mysteries of COVID-19, we conclude with questions and some hypothetical studies that may answer them.

AB  - Summary
Background
COVID-19 has disproportionately affected minority ethnic populations in the UK. Our aim was to quantify ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcomes during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in England.
Methods
We conducted an observational cohort study of adults (aged ≥18 years) registered with primary care practices in England for whom electronic health records were available through the OpenSAFELY platform, and who had at least 1 year of continuous registration at the start of each study period (Feb 1 to Aug 3, 2020 [wave 1], and Sept 1 to Dec 31, 2020 [wave 2]). Individual-level primary care data were linked to data from other sources on the outcomes of interest: SARS-CoV-2 testing and positive test results and COVID-19-related hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and death. The exposure was self-reported ethnicity as captured on the primary care record, grouped into five high-level census categories (White, South Asian, Black, other, and mixed) and 16 subcategories across these five categories, as well as an unknown ethnicity category. We used multivariable Cox regression to examine ethnic differences in the outcomes of interest. Models were adjusted for age, sex, deprivation, clinical factors and comorbidities, and household size, with stratification by geographical region.
Findings
Of 17 288 532 adults included in the study (excluding care home residents), 10 877 978 (62·9%) were White, 1 025 319 (5·9%) were South Asian, 340 912 (2·0%) were Black, 170 484 (1·0%) were of mixed ethnicity, 320 788 (1·9%) were of other ethnicity, and 4 553 051 (26·3%) were of unknown ethnicity. In wave 1, the likelihood of being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection was slightly higher in the South Asian group (adjusted hazard ratio 1·08 [95% CI 1·07–1·09]), Black group (1·08 [1·06–1·09]), and mixed ethnicity group (1·04 [1·02–1·05]) and was decreased in the other ethnicity group (0·77 [0·76–0·78]) relative to the White group. The risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher in the South Asian group (1·99 [1·94–2·04]), Black group (1·69 [1·62–1·77]), mixed ethnicity group (1·49 [1·39–1·59]), and other ethnicity group (1·20 [1·14–1·28]). Compared with the White group, the four remaining high-level ethnic groups had an increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation (South Asian group 1·48 [1·41–1·55], Black group 1·78 [1·67–1·90], mixed ethnicity group 1·63 [1·45–1·83], other ethnicity group 1·54 [1·41–1·69]), COVID-19-related ICU admission (2·18 [1·92–2·48], 3·12 [2·65–3·67], 2·96 [2·26–3·87], 3·18 [2·58–3·93]), and death (1·26 [1·15–1·37], 1·51 [1·31–1·71], 1·41 [1·11–1·81], 1·22 [1·00–1·48]). In wave 2, the risks of hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death relative to the White group were increased in the South Asian group but attenuated for the Black group compared with these risks in wave 1. Disaggregation into 16 ethnicity groups showed important heterogeneity within the five broader categories.
Interpretation
Some minority ethnic populations in England have excess risks of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and of adverse COVID-19 outcomes compared with the White population, even after accounting for differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and household characteristics. Causes are likely to be multifactorial, and delineating the exact mechanisms is crucial. Tackling ethnic inequalities will require action across many fronts, including reducing structural inequalities, addressing barriers to equitable care, and improving uptake of testing and vaccination.

AB  - Background and aims
The novel SARS-CoV-2 has been rattling the world since its outbreak in December 2019, leading to the COVID-19 pandemic. The learning curve of this new virus has been steep, with a global scientific community desperate to learn how the virus is transmitted, how it replicates, why it causes such a wide spectrum of disease manifestations, resulting in none or few symptoms in some. Others are burdened by an intense immune response that resembles the cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), which leads to severe disease manifestations, often complicated by fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. Research efforts have been focusing on finding effective cures and vaccinations for this virus. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, represented by several GI manifestations, has led to its investigation as a target for the virus and as an indicator of disease severity. The response of the microbiome (which is heavily linked to immunity) to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, and its role in igniting the exaggerated immune response has therefore become a focus of interest. The objective of our study was to gather the data connecting between the microbiome, the GI tract and COVID-19 and to investigate whether these reported alterations in the gut microbiome bear any resemblance to those seen in lupus, the prototypical autoimmune disease. Confirming such changes may become the steppingstone to potential therapies that may prevent transmission, progression and immune related manifestations of COVID-19, via manipulation of the gut microbiota.
Methods
We performed an extensive literature review, utilizing the Pubmed search engine and Google Scholar for studies evaluating the microbiome in COVID-19 patients and compared results with studies evaluating the microbiome in lupus. We searched for the terms: microbiome, dysbiosis, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, gastrointestinal as well as lupus and autoimmune. While there were hundreds of articles which referred to gastrointestinal manifestations in COVID-19, to date only 4 studies investigated the gastrointestinal microbiome in this setting. We compared the similarities between microbiome of COVID-19 patients and lupus patients.
Results
We found that there are several similar processes of immune dysregulation in patients with COVID-19 and in those with lupus, with several other alterations seen in other pathological states. Some of these similarities include loss of microbiota biodiversity, increased representation of pathobionts, which are microbes associated with inflammation and disease (i.e Proteobacteria) and a relative decrease of symbionts, which are protective microbes, associated with anti-inflammatory properties (i.e Lactobacillus). Compromise to the intestinal barrier has also been reported in both.
Conclusions
We conclude that the gastrointestinal tract contributes to the disease manifestations in COVID-19. Whether gastrointestinal dysbiosis is the cause or effect of gastrointestinal manifestations and several severe systemic manifestations, which may be the response to an increased pro-inflammatory environment, is still debatable and warrants further investigation. Given the resemblance of the microbiome in COVID-19 patients to that seen in lupus patients, it becomes clearer why several therapies used in autoimmune conditions are currently under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, these findings should promote further investigating the utility of manipulation of the microbiome, via nutritional supplementation or even fecal transplantations, interventions that may alter the course of the disease, and potentially prevent disease transmission at low cost and low risk.

AB  - Human milk constitutes a secretion with unique functions of both nourishing the nursling and providing protection against enteric and respiratory infections, mainly due to its content of secretory IgA antibodies but also due to the presence of a plethora of bioactive factors. Specific IgA antibodies are produced locally by plasma cells derived from B lymphocytes that migrate from other mucosae to the mammary gland during lactation, particularly from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Therefore, here, the authors will provide a comprehensive review of the content and functions of different nutritional and bioactive anti-infectious components from breast milk, such as oligosaccharides, lactoferrin, haptocorrin, α-lactalbumin, k-casein, lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, mucin, fatty acids, defensins, cytokines and chemokines, hormones and growth factors, complement proteins, leukocytes and nucleic acids, including microRNAs, among many others, and the induction of antibody responses in breast milk after maternal vaccination with several licensed vaccines, including the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine preparations used worldwide. Currently, in the midst of the pandemic, maternal vaccination has re-emerged as a crucial source of passive immunity to the neonate through the placenta and breastfeeding, considering that maternal vaccination can induce specific antibodies if performed during pregnancy and after delivery. There have been some reports in the literature about milk IgA antibodies induced by bacterial antigens or inactivated virus vaccines, such as anti-diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, anti-influenza viruses, anti-pneumococcal and meningococcal polysaccharide preparations. Regarding anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, most studies demonstrate elevated levels of specific IgA and IgG antibodies in milk with virus-neutralizing ability after maternal vaccination, which represents an additional approach to improve the protection of the nursling during the entire breastfeeding period.

AB  - This paper uses time-frequency analysis, including wavelet analysis and time-frequency domain causality, to evaluate the relationship between public attention to the COVID-19 pandemic, crude oil, and gold markets in the G7 countries over time and frequency. Empirical findings show that WTI oil lead gold returns during the COVID-19 outbreak, and vice versa when Omicron spread. The relationship between public attention to the COVID-19 and WTI oil/gold markets appears to be heterogeneous for G7 countries. European public attention caused by the COVID-19 outbreak has a strong impact on gold returns at the 32–64 day frequency, while public attention generated by Omicron has a significant effect on WTI oil returns at 4–128 day frequency. The public in the US and Canada is more concerned about the global stock and WTI oil markets slump than the COVID-19 pandemic. The Italian public seems to be the most sensitive to the EU's economic support plan. The heterogeneity of the public attention-oil/gold nexus in the G7 implies that portfolio diversification across markets and investment horizons may be extremely beneficial.

AB  - Global researchers and medical experts work tirelessly to develop vaccines and drugs against COVID-19. However, it takes at least a few months, if not longer, to receive final regulatory approvals for vaccines and drugs, and the world, facing the threat of a second wave, has no choice but to implement a mandatory global quarantine, which would result in the most devastating socioeconomic disaster the world has ever seen. COVID-19 infection and mortality rates differ significantly across countries, which may be due to variations in healthcare infrastructure, testing facilities, international travel, environmental factors, and cultural norms. According to data from observational studies, epidemiological studies, and recent randomized controlled trials, existing live-attenuated vaccines such as BCG, measles, chickenpox, and OPV have immune-modulating nonspecific effects that can influence host defense against diseases caused by unrelated pathogens, resulting in lower morbidity and mortality. As a result, drug/existing vaccine repurposing is currently crucial in accelerating advanced clinical trials and reducing the time it takes to obtain regulatory approval. In this chapter we discuss how repurposing strategies have helped to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, the limitations of repurposing drugs, and the current status of COVID-19 vaccines, and the limitations of these vaccines due to evolving genome of coronavirus strain.

AB  - Purpose
To critically evaluate the potential impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on global ophthalmology and VISION 2020.
Design
Perspective supplemented with epidemiologic insights from available online databases.
Methods
We extracted data from the Global Vision Database (2017) and Global Burden of Disease Study (2017) to highlight temporal trends in global blindness since 1990, and provide a narrative overview of how COVID-19 may derail progress toward the goals of VISION 2020.
Results
Over 2 decades of VISION 2020 advocacy and program implementation have culminated in a universal reduction of combined age-standardized prevalence of moderate-to-severe vision impairment (MSVI) across all world regions since 1990. Between 1990 and 2017, low-income countries observed large reductions in the age-standardized prevalence per 100,000 persons of vitamin A deficiency (25,155 to 19,187), undercorrected refractive disorders (2,286 to 2,040), cataract (1,846 to 1,690), onchocerciasis (5,577 to 2,871), trachoma (506 to 159), and leprosy (36 to 26). Despite these reductions, crude projections suggest that more than 700 million persons will experience MSVI or blindness by 2050, principally owing to our growing and ageing global population.
Conclusions
Despite the many resounding successes of VISION 2020, the burden of global blindness and vision impairment is set to reach historic levels in the coming years. The impact of COVID-19, while yet to be fully determined, now threatens the hard-fought gains of global ophthalmology. The postpandemic years will require renewed effort and focus on vision advocacy and expanding eye care services worldwide.

KW  - The COVID-19 pandemic
AB  - In this paper, we propose a new framework to coherently produce probabilistic mortality forecasts by exploiting techniques in seasonal time-series models, extreme value theory (EVT), and hierarchical forecast reconciliation. In a hierarchical setting, coherent forecasts are those forecasts that add up in a manner consistent with the aggregation structure of the collection of time series. We are amongst the first to model and analyze U.S. monthly death data during the period from 1968–2019 to explore the seasonality and the age–gender dependence structure of mortality. Our results indicate that incorporating EVT and hierarchical forecast reconciliation greatly improves the overall forecast accuracy, which has important implications for life insurers in terms of rate making, reserve setting, and capital adequacy compliance. Using the solvency capital requirement (SCR) under Solvency II as an example, we show that the SCR calculated by our approach is considerably higher than those calculated by alternative models, suggesting that failing to account for extreme mortality risk and mortality dependence in the hierarchy can result in significantly underfunded problems for life insurers. We also find that our model can yield death forecasts that are largely consistent with actual observations in most of months in 2021 when death tolls surged due to COVID-19. This provides additional evidence of the effectiveness of our model for practical uses.

AB  - The challenges humanity is facing due to the Covid-19 pandemic require timely and accurate forecasting of the dynamics of various epidemics to minimize the negative consequences for public health and the economy. One can use a variety of well-known and new mathematical models, taking into account a huge number of factors. However, complex models contain a large number of unknown parameters, the values of which must be determined using a limited number of observations, e.g., the daily datasets for the accumulated number of cases. Successful experience in modeling the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that it is possible to apply the simplest SIR model, which contains 4 unknown parameters. Application of the original algorithm of the model parameter identification for the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, South Korea, Austria, Italy, Germany, France, Spain has shown its high accuracy in predicting their duration and number of diseases. To simulate different epidemic waves and take into account the incompleteness of statistical data, the generalized SIR model and algorithms for determining the values of its parameters were proposed. The interference of the previous waves, changes in testing levels, quarantine or social behavior require constant monitoring of the epidemic dynamics and performing SIR simulations as often as possible with the use of a user-friendly interface. Such tool will allow predicting the dynamics of any epidemic using the data on the number of diseases over a limited period (e.g., 14 days). It will be possible to predict the daily number of new cases for the country as a whole or for its separate region, to estimate the number of carriers of the infection and the probability of facing such a carrier, as well as to estimate the number of deaths. Results of three SIR simulations of the COVID-19 epidemic wave in Japan in the summer of 2022 are presented and discussed. The predicted accumulated and daily numbers of cases agree with the results of observations, especially for the simulation based on the datasets corresponding to the period from July 3 to July 16, 2022. A user-friendly interface also has to ensure an opportunity to compare the epidemic dynamics in different countries/regions and in different years in order to estimate the impact of vaccination levels, quarantine restrictions, social behavior, etc. on the numbers of new infections, death, and mortality rates. As example, the comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in Japan in the summer of 2020, 2021 and 2022 is presented. The high level of vaccinations achieved in the summer of 2022 did not save Japan from a powerful pandemic wave. The daily numbers of cases were about ten times higher than in the corresponding period of 2021. Nevertheless, the death per case ratio in 2022 was much lower than in 2020.

To identify factors that contribute to the increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 in obese children and adolescents, and its health consequences.
Sources
Studies published between 2000 and 2020 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, SciELO, and Cochrane databases.
Summary of findings
Obesity is a highly prevalent comorbidity in severe cases of COVID-19 in children and adolescents; social isolation may lead to increase fat accumulation. Excessive adipose tissue, deficit in lean mass, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and low intake of essential nutrients are factors that compromise the functioning of organs and systems in obese individuals. These factors are associated with damage to immune, cardiovascular, respiratory, and urinary systems, along with modification of the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis). In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, these organic changes from obesity may increase the need for ventilatory assistance, risk of thromboembolism, reduced glomerular filtration rate, changes in the innate and adaptive immune response, and perpetuation of the chronic inflammatory response.
Conclusions
The need for social isolation can have the effect of causing or worsening obesity and its comorbidities, and pediatricians need to be aware of this issue. Facing children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, health professionals should 1) diagnose excess weight; 2) advise on health care in times of isolation; 3) screen for comorbidities, ensuring that treatment is not interrupted; 4) measure levels of immunonutrients; 5) guide the family in understanding the specifics of the situation; and 6) refer to units qualified to care for obese children and adolescents when necessary.
Resumo
Objetivo
Identificar fatores que contribuem para o aumento da suscetibilidade e gravidade da COVID-19 em crianças e adolescentes obesos e suas consequências para a saúde.
Fontes de dados
Estudos publicados entre 2000 e 2020 nas bases de dados PubMed, Medline, Scopus, SciELO e Cochrane.
Síntese dos dados
A obesidade é uma comorbidade altamente prevalente em casos graves de COVID-19 em crianças e adolescentes e o isolamento social pode levar ao aumento do acúmulo de gordura. Tecido adiposo excessivo, déficit de massa magra, resistência à insulina, dislipidemia, hipertensão, altos níveis de citocinas pró-inflamatórias e baixa ingestão de nutrientes essenciais são fatores que comprometem o funcionamento dos órgãos e sistemas no indivíduo obeso. Esses fatores estão associados a danos nos sistemas imunológico, cardiovascular, respiratório e urinário, juntamente com a modificação da microbiota intestinal (disbiose). Na infecção por SARS-CoV-2, essas alterações orgânicas causadas pela obesidade podem aumentar a necessidade de assistência ventilatória, risco de tromboembolismo, taxa de filtração glomerular reduzida, alterações na resposta imune inata e adaptativa e perpetuação da resposta inflamatória crônica.
Conclusões
A necessidade de isolamento social pode ter o efeito de causar ou agravar a obesidade e suas comorbidades e pediatras precisam estar cientes desse problema. Diante de crianças com suspeita ou confirmação de COVID-19, os profissionais de saúde devem 1) diagnosticar o excesso de peso; 2) aconselhar sobre cuidados de saúde em tempos de isolamento; 3) fazer a triagem de comorbidades, garantindo que o tratamento não seja interrompido; 4) medir os níveis de imunonutrientes; 5) orientar a família respeitando as especificidades da situação; e 6) encaminhamento a unidades qualificadas para cuidar de crianças e adolescentes obesos, quando necessário.

AB  - Taking anti-inflammatory drugs, including non-steroidal (NSAIDs), during Covid-19 infection, how much is risky? The French Minister of Health, who has raised an alarm on a possible risk deriving from the use of ibuprofen for the control of fever and other symptoms during the disease, opened the debate a few days ago. In this paper we examine available evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that had analysed the role of COX in the inflammatory process and the effects of NSAIDs in patients with infections. Most of the published studies that suggested not protective effects of NSAIDs were mainly performed in vitro or on animals. Therefore, their meaning in humans is to be considered with great caution. Based also on data suggesting protective effects of NSAIDs, we concluded that currently there is no evidence suggesting a correlation between NSAIDs and a worsening of infections. Further studies will be certainly needed to better define the role of NSAIDs and particularly COX2 inhibitors in patients with infections. In the meantime, we must wait for results of the revision started by the PRAC on May 2019 on the association ibuprofen/ketoprofen​​​​​​ and worsening of infections. Since nowadays no scientific evidence establishes a correlation between NSAIDS and worsening of COVID-19, patients should be advice against any NSAIDs self-medication when COVID-19 like symptoms are present.

AB  - A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been identified. The disease caused by this virus was termed Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The most common reported symptoms include fever, cough, headache, and fatigue. Vast central nervous system and peripheral nervous system complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 have been recently reported. The main mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and neuroinvasion is hypothesized to be related to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor. Damage to nervous system is mainly by hyperactivation of the immune system with overproduction of inflammatory mediators and producing autoantibodies. Here we review the peripheral nervous system manifestations and complications associated with COVID-19 and highlight its immune-mediated mechanism of pathology. Common neurological complications in COVID-19 include Guillain–Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, Cranial neuropathy, and myopathy. Our aim is to update the physicians working with suspected cases of COVID-19 about the possible neurological complication.

AB  - ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic may profoundly harm the mental health and emotional well- being of many older adults. Public health interventions to minimize the spread of the virus have had the unintended consequences of worsening social isolation, financial stress, and unemployment. Results of early research efforts assessing the impact of these interventions on the mental health of older adults have been mixed. Available findings suggest that a subset of community-dwelling older adults have been less negatively impacted than younger adults, while people of color, the poor, residents of nursing homes and other communal living environments, and those living with dementia and their caregivers are more likely to suffer from COVID-related health problems. This manuscript describes two older adults for whom COVID-19 associated stresses caused significant worsening in their psychiatric illnesses, including the emergence of suicidal ideation, summarizes the literature on the impact of interactions between psychosocial stresses and biological factors on the mental health and well-being of older adults, and discusses interventions to help older adults whose mental health has worsened due to COVID-19. Timely and accurate diagnosis, prompt provision of individualized care using both pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic interventions, adoption of new technologies that permit care to be provided safely at a distance and which allow for virtual social interactions, coupled with ongoing advocacy for policy changes that address significant health care disparities and provide older adults continued access to health care and relief from financial hardship, will help older adults remaining as healthy as possible during the pandemic.

AB  - Introduction
The burden of influenza in the paediatric population is often underestimated by healthcare professionals and the general population, mainly due to poor perception of its clinical importance at the individual level and its health impact at the healthcare level. The aim of this review was to collect data on the burden of paediatric influenza in Spain and to compare them with data of countries where vaccination strategies for healthy paediatric populations have been implemented.
Methods
We collected data on the burden of paediatric influenza in Spain through a systematic search of literature published between 2016–2021 (PRISMA methodology). We conducted a review of reports from the Spanish Influenza Surveillance System (SVGE) (2010–2011 to 2019–2020) and of international reports (from Canada, Finland, USA, and UK) through a systematic (2016–2021) and pragmatic search.
Results
1366 articles were obtained from the systematic searches by country; 26 met the inclusion criteria. According to the SVGE (Spain's Influenza Surveillance System), those <15 years have the highest incidence of influenza per 100,000 population (cumulative-mean rate: 9457.9) compared to those ≥15 years (2285.6), and percentage of admission to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) greater than those >65 years (mean: 29.1% vs. 17.5%). Hospitalisation of severe cases per 100,000 population in children aged 0–4 years and those >65 years is similar (median: 20.2 vs. 28.4). Those aged <15 years have a higher incidence rate per 100,000 population (213.3), in contrast to those aged 15–64 years (21.9) and those aged ≥65 years (65.2). In countries with paediatric vaccination programmes (USA, Finland, and UK) the burden of influenza in children is reduced by 40%–74%, whereas 50%-93.5-% of cases presenting to the ED, hospitalised, admitted to PICU, or dying from influenza are unvaccinated.
Conclusions
The burden of paediatric influenza in Spain includes a significant number of hospitalisations and PICU admissions and justifies the vaccination strategy recommended by the WHO since 2012. In countries with this recommendation, the vaccinated paediatric population is better protected against severe forms of influenza and potential benefits for reducing the burden of paediatric influenza in Spain can be extracted from their data.
Resumen
Introducción
La carga de gripe en población pediátrica suele estar infravalorada por los sanitarios y por la población general debido fundamentalmente a la escasa percepción de su importancia clínica a nivel individual como al impacto sanitario a nivel asistencial. El objetivo de esta revisión es recopilar datos sobre la carga de gripe pediátrica en España y contrastarlos con los de países en los que hay implementadas estrategias de vacunación de población pediátrica sana.
Métodos
Se recopilaron datos de carga de gripe pediátrica en España mediante búsqueda sistemática de literatura publicada entre 2016–2021 (metodología PRISMA) y revisión de informes del Sistema de Vigilancia de la Gripe en España (SVGE) (2010–2011 a 2019–2020) e internacionales (de Canadá, Finlandia, EE. UU. y Reino Unido) mediante búsqueda sistemática (2016–2021) y pragmática.
Resultados
Se obtuvieron 1366 artículos de las búsquedas sistemáticas por países; 26 cumplían los criterios de inclusión. Según el SVGE, los <15 años presentan la mayor incidencia de gripe por 100,000 habitantes (tasa acumulada-mediana: 9457,9) respecto a los ≥15 años (2285,6); y porcentaje de ingreso en la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos Pediátricos (UCIP) mayor que los >65 años (media: 29,1% vs. 17,5%). La hospitalización de casos graves por 100,000 habitantes en niños de 0–4 años y en los >65 años es similar (mediana: 20,2 vs. 28,4). Los <15 años tienen mayor tasa de incidencia por 100,000 habitantes (213,3), en contraste con la de los de 15–64 años (21,9) y los ≥65 años (65,2). En los países con programa de vacunación pediátrica (EE. UU., Finlandia y Reino Unido) se reduce la carga de la gripe en niños entre un 40–74% mientras que 50–93,5-% de los casos que acuden a Urgencias, son hospitalizados, ingresan en UCIP o fallecen por gripe no están vacunados.
Conclusiones
La carga de gripe pediátrica en España incluye un importante número de hospitalizaciones e ingresos en la UCIP y justifica la estrategia de vacunación recomendada por la OMS desde 2012. En países con dicha recomendación, la población pediátrica vacunada está más protegida frente a formas graves de gripe y de sus datos se extraen potenciales beneficios para disminuir la carga de gripe pediátrica en España.

AB  - Summary
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has global impacts but is relatively understudied in developing countries. Mongolia, a lower-middle-income country, instituted strict control measures in early 2020 and avoided widespread transmission until vaccines became available in February, 2021. Mongolia achieved its 60% vaccination coverage goal by July 2021. We investigated the distribution and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Mongolia over 2020 and 2021.
Methods
We performed a longitudinal seroepidemiologic study aligned with WHO's Unity Studies protocols. We collected data from a panel of 5000 individuals in four rounds between October 2020 and December 2021. We selected participants through local health centres across Mongolia by age-stratified multi-stage cluster sampling. We tested serum for the presence of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain, and levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG and neutralising antibodies. We linked participant data with national mortality, COVID-19 case, and vaccination registries. We estimated population seroprevalence and vaccine uptake, as well as unvaccinated population prior-infection prevalence.
Findings
At the final round in late 2021, 82% (n = 4088) of participants completed follow-up. Estimated seroprevalence increased from 1.5% (95% CI: 1.2–2.0), to 82.3% (95% CI: 79.5–84.8) between late-2020 and late-2021. At the final round an estimated 62.4% (95% CI: 60.2–64.5) of the population were vaccinated, and of the unvaccinated population 64.5% (95% CI: 59.7–69.0) had been infected. Cumulative case ascertainment in the unvaccinated was 22.8% (95% CI: 19.1%–26.9%) and the overall infection-fatality ratio was 0.100% (95% CI: 0.088–0.124). Health workers had higher odds for being COVID-19 confirmed cases at all rounds. Males (1.72 (95% CI: 1.33–2.22)) and adults aged 20 and above (12.70 (95% CI: 8.14–20.26)) had higher odds for seroconverting by mid-2021. Among the seropositive, 87.1% (95% CI: 82.3%–90.8%) had SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies by late 2021.
Interpretation
Our study enabled tracking of SARS-CoV-2 serological markers in the Mongolian population over one year. We found low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in 2020 and early 2021, with seropositivity increasing over a 3-month interval in 2021 due to vaccine roll out and rapid infection of most of the unvaccinated population. Despite high seroprevalence in Mongolia amongst both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals by end-2021, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron immune escape variant caused a substantial epidemic.

AB  - The ecosyndemic theory combines the concept of ‘synergy’ with ‘epidemic’ and the term “eco” implies the role of the environmental changes. Each of the conditions enhances the negative impacts of the other in an additive way making our society more vulnerable and heightening individual risk factors. In this study, we analyze the mutually reinforcing links between the environment and health from the complexity angle of the ecosyndemic theory and propose the characterization of the COVID-19 pandemic as ecosyndemic. We use the term ‘ecosyndemic’ because the global environmental change contributes to local-scale, regional-scale and global-scale alterations of the Earth's systems. These changes have their root causes in the way that people interact with the physical, chemical, and biotic factors of the environment. These interactions disturb nature and the consequences have feedbacks in every living organism.

AB  - Summary
Background
Although the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic progressed more slowly in Africa than the rest of the world, by December, 2020, the second wave appeared to be much more aggressive with many more cases. To date, the pandemic situation in all 55 African Union (AU) Member States has not been comprehensively reviewed. We aimed to evaluate reported COVID-19 epidemiology data to better understand the pandemic's progression in Africa.
Methods
We did a cross-sectional analysis between Feb 14 and Dec 31, 2020, using COVID-19 epidemiological, testing, and mitigation strategy data reported by AU Member States to assess trends and identify the response and mitigation efforts at the country, regional, and continent levels. We did descriptive analyses on the variables of interest including cumulative and weekly incidence rates, case fatality ratios (CFRs), tests per case ratios, growth rates, and public health and social measures in place.
Findings
As of Dec 31, 2020, African countries had reported 2 763 421 COVID-19 cases and 65 602 deaths, accounting for 3·4% of the 82 312 150 cases and 3·6% of the 1 798 994 deaths reported globally. Nine of the 55 countries accounted for more than 82·6% (2 283 613) of reported cases. 18 countries reported CFRs greater than the global CFR (2·2%). 17 countries reported test per case ratios less than the recommended ten to 30 tests per case ratio range. At the peak of the first wave in Africa in July, 2020, the mean daily number of new cases was 18 273. As of Dec 31, 2020, 40 (73%) countries had experienced or were experiencing their second wave of cases with the continent reporting a mean of 23 790 daily new cases for epidemiological week 53. 48 (96%) of 50 Member States had five or more stringent public health and social measures in place by April 15, 2020, but this number had decreased to 36 (72%) as of Dec 31, 2020, despite an increase in cases in the preceding month.
Interpretation
Our analysis showed that the African continent had a more severe second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic than the first, and highlights the importance of examining multiple epidemiological variables down to the regional and country levels over time. These country-specific and regional results informed the implementation of continent-wide initiatives and supported equitable distribution of supplies and technical assistance. Monitoring and analysis of these data over time are essential for continued situational awareness, especially as Member States attempt to balance controlling COVID-19 transmission with ensuring stable economies and livelihoods.

AB  - Herein, we demonstrated the development and characterization of a dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulation of edoxaban (EDX); and investigated the in-vitro anticoagulation effect for the management of pulmonary or cerebral coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 infection. The formulations were prepared by mixing the inhalable micronized drug with a large carrier lactose and dispersibility enhancers, leucine, and magnesium stearate. The drug-excipient interaction was studied using X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) methods. The drug and excipients showed no physical inter particulate interaction. The in-vitro drug aerosolization from the developed formulation was determined by a Twin Stage Impinger (TSI) at a flow rate of 60 ± 5 L /min. The amount of drug deposition was quantified by an established HPLC-UV method. The fine particle fraction (FPF) of EDX API from drug alone formulation was 7%, whereas the formulations with excipients increased dramatically to almost 7-folds up to 47%. The developed DPI formulation of EDX showed a promising in-vitro anticoagulation effect at a very low concentration. This novel DPI formulation of EDX could be a potential and effective inhalation therapy for managing pulmonary venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with COVID-19 infection. Further studies are warranted to investigate the toxicity and clinical application of the inhaled EDX DPI formulation.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has disturbed the delivery of health care in almost all countries of the world. This has affected mostly the public health control programs. Because of lock downs, restrictions in movement, psychological fear of contacting the disease in health care facilities, diversion of health care workers for containment and management of COVID-19, utilization of diagnostic facilities like CBNAAT machines for COVID work, conversion of hospitals for care of these patients, financial diversion etc has created issues in the NTEP to focuss on TB control in India. Case notification and other areas of the program to achieve End TB by 2025 have suffered. Various ways of overcoming these difficulties have been discussed.

AB  - Summary
Long-standing systemic inequalities—fueling unequal access to critical resources such as healthcare, housing, education, and employment opportunities—are largely responsible for the significant race disparities in obesity and COVID-19. Because of this legacy, public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impact communities of color, exacerbated by high rates of pre-existing chronic diseases like obesity. Learning from this history is instructive for understanding our present situation and for crafting effective solutions that promote health equity. Critical action is needed now to meaningfully address the disproportionate impact of these major public health problems on Black and Brown populations.

AB  - Summary
The lungs are constantly exposed to inhaled debris, allergens, pollutants, commensal or pathogenic microorganisms, and respiratory viruses. As a result, innate and adaptive immune responses in the respiratory tract are tightly regulated and are in continual flux between states of enhanced pathogen clearance, immune-modulation, and tissue repair. New single-cell-sequencing techniques are expanding our knowledge of airway cellular complexity and the nuanced connections between structural and immune cell compartments. Understanding these varied interactions is critical in treatment of human pulmonary disease and infections and in next-generation vaccine design. Here, we review the innate and adaptive immune responses in the lung and airways following infection and vaccination, with particular focus on influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has put pulmonary research firmly into the global spotlight, challenging previously held notions of respiratory immunity and helping identify new populations at high risk for respiratory distress.

AB  - Ten months into the Covid-19 pandemic it remains unclear whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is affected by climate factors. Using a dynamic epidemiological model with Covid-19 climate sensitivity in the likely range, we demonstrate why attempts to detect a climate signal in Covid-19 have thus far been inconclusive. Then we formulate a novel methodology based on susceptible-infected time trajectories that can be used to test for seasonal climate sensitivity in observed Covid-19 infection data. We show that if the disease does have a substantial seasonal dependence, and herd immunity is not established during the first peak season of the outbreak (or a vaccine does not become available), there is likely to be a seasonality-sensitive second wave of infections about one year after the initial outbreak. In regions where non-pharmaceutical control has contained the disease in the first year of outbreak and thus kept a large portion of the population susceptible, the second wave may be substantially larger in amplitude than the first if control measures are relaxed. This is simply because it develops under the favorable conditions of a full autumn to winter period and from a larger pool of infected individuals.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 instigated by coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has delivered an unfathomable obstruction that has touched all sectors worldwide. Despite new vaccine technologies and mass administration of booster doses, the virus persists, and unknown the ending of the pandemic for new variants and sub-variants. Moreover, whether leaning on home medications or using plant extracts is sufficient often to combat the virus has generated tremendous interest in the scientific fraternity. Different databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar used to find published articles linked with related topics. Currently, COVID-19 third and fourth shots of vaccines are progressively administered worldwide, where some countries trail others by a significant margin. Many proteins related to viral activity have changed, possibly boosting the virus infectivity and making antibodies ineffective. This study will reminisce the viral genome, associated pathways for viral protein functions, variants, and their mutations. The current, comprehensive review will also provide information on vaccine technologies developed by several biotech companies and the efficacy of their doses, costs including boosters on a mass level. As no vaccine is working to protect fully against all the variants, the new proactive vaccine research needs to be conducted based on all variants, their sub-lineage, and mutations.

AB  - The global public health crisis caused by COVID-19 has lasted longer than many of us would have hoped and expected. With its high uncertainty and limited control, the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly asked a lot from all of us. One important central question is: how resilient have we proved in face of the unprecedented and prolonged coronavirus pandemic? There is a vast and rapidly growing literature that has examined the impact of the pandemic on mental health both on the shorter (2020) and longer (2021) term. This not only concerns pandemic-related effects on resilience in the general population, but also how the pandemic has challenged stress resilience and mental health outcomes across more specific vulnerable population groups: patients with a psychiatric disorder, COVID-19 diagnosed patients, health care workers, children and adolescents, pregnant women, and elderly people. It is challenging to keep up to date with, and interpret, this rapidly increasing scientific literature. In this review, we provide a critical overview on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted mental health and how human stress resilience has been shaped by the pandemic on the shorter and longer term. The vast literature is dominated by a wealth of data which are, however, not always of the highest quality and heavily depend on online and self-report surveys. Nevertheless, it appears that we have proven surprisingly resilient over time, with fast recovery from COVID-19 measures. Still, vulnerable groups such as adolescents and health care personnel that have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic do exist. Large interindividual differences exist, and for future pandemics there is a clear need to comprehensively and integratively assess resilience from the start to provide personalized help and interventions tailored to the specific needs for vulnerable groups.

AB  - Objective
Various studies have identified factors associated with risk of mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their sample size has often been limited and their results partially contradictory. This study evaluated factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in the population of Madrid over 75 years of age, in infected patients, and in hospitalized patients up to January 2021.
Patients and Methods
This population-based cohort study analyzed all residents of the Community of Madrid born before January 1, 1945 who were alive as of December 31, 2019. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from primary care electronic medical records (PC-Madrid), data on hospital admissions from the Conjunto Mínimo Básico de Datos (CMBD, Minimum Data Set), and data on mortality from the Índice Nacional de Defunciones (INDEF, National Death Index). Data on SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death were collected from March 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021.
Results
A total of 587,603 subjects were included in the cohort. Of them, 41,603 (7.1%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, of which 22,362 (53.7% of the infected individuals) were hospitalized and 11,251 (27%) died. Male sex and age were the factors most closely associated with mortality, though many comorbidities also had an influence. The associations were stronger in the analysis of the total population than in the analysis of infected or hospitalized patients. Mortality among hospitalized patients was lower during the second wave (33.4%) than during the first wave (41.2%) of the pandemic.
Conclusion
Age, sex, and numerous comorbidities are associated with risk of death due to COVID-19. Mortality in hospitalized patients declined notably after the first wave of the pandemic.
Resumen
Objetivo
Diversos estudios han identificado factores asociados con el riesgo de muerte en pacientes infectados por SARS-CoV-2. Sin embargo, su tamaño muestral ha sido muchas veces limitado, y sus resultados parcialmente contradictorios. Este estudio ha evaluado los factores asociados con la mortalidad por COVID-19 en la población madrileña mayor de 75 años, en los pacientes infectados y en los hospitalizados hasta enero de 2021.
Pacientes y métodos
Estudio de cohortes de base poblacional con todos los residentes de la Comunidad de Madrid nacidos antes del 1 de enero de 1945 y vivos a 31 de diciembre de 2019. Se obtuvieron variables demográficas y clínicas de la historia clínica electrónica de atención primaria (AP-Madrid), de los ingresos hospitalarios a través del Conjunto Mínimo Básico de Datos (CMBD) y de la mortalidad a través del Índice Nacional de Defunciones (INDEF). Se recogieron los datos de infección, hospitalización y muerte por SARS-CoV-2 entre el 1 de marzo de 2020 y el 31 de enero de 2021.
Resultados
De los 587.603 sujetos incluidos en la cohorte, 41.603 (7,1%) desarrollaron una infección confirmada por SARS-CoV-2. De ellos, 22.362 (53,7% de los infectados) se hospitalizaron y 11.251 (27%) murieron. El sexo masculino y la edad fueron los factores más asociados con la mortalidad, si bien también contribuyeron numerosas comorbilidades. La asociación fue de mayor magnitud en los análisis poblacionales que en los análisis con pacientes infectados u hospitalizados. La mortalidad en los hospitalizados fue menor en la segunda ola (33,4%) que en la primera ola (41,2%) de la pandemia.
Conclusión
La edad, el sexo y las numerosas comorbilidades se asocian con el riesgo de muerte por COVID-19. La mortalidad en los pacientes hospitalizados se redujo apreciablemente después de la primera ola de la pandemia.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) develops within 3–14 days when CoV2 invades epithelial, myeloid cells in the nasopharynx and pneumocytes in the respiratory tract through angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2). Infection swiftly disseminates to gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal organs as well as immune system to deregulate their normal functioning through unique and distinct mechanisms. The health system and economy has been intensely thwarted by the rapid spread and exorbitant mortality caused by COVID-19 disease across the globe. The acute progression of the disease and high infection rate pose an enormous challenge for its therapeutic management and critical care. The viral structure, genome and proteome have been deciphered which yielded cues for targeting already available therapeutic entities. More than 200 compounds have been screened and till date approximately 69 therapeutic agents are undergoing clinical trials across the world. Among these, remedesivir (RMD), chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), noscapine (NOS) and heparin have demonstrated fairly promising results in preclinical and clinical studies. Recently, RMD has been approved by USFDA for the management of COVID 19. However, intense research is going on to screen and ace the ‘magic bullets’ for the management of SARS-CoV2 infection worldwide. The current review illustrates the plausible therapeutic targets in SARS-CoV2 important for inhibition of virus cycle. In addition, the role of RMD, CQ, HCQ, NOS and heparin in combating infection has been addressed. The importance of vitamin C and D supplements as adjunct therapies in the prevention of SARS-CoV2 virus infection have also been summarized.

AB  - To address the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an unprecedented global effort to advance potent neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 as therapeutics. However, historical efforts to advance antiviral monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the treatment of other respiratory infections have been met with categorical failures in the clinic. By investigating the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 and similar viruses spread within the lung, along with available biodistribution data for systemically injected mAb, we highlight the challenges faced by current antiviral mAbs for COVID-19. We summarize some of the leading mAbs currently in development, and present the evidence supporting inhaled delivery of antiviral mAb as an early intervention against COVID-19 that could prevent important pulmonary morbidities associated with the infection.

AB  - Lateral flow assays (LFAs) are promising points-of-care tests, playing a vital role in diseases screening, diagnosis and surveillance. However, development of portable, cheap, and smart LFAs platform for sensitive and accurate quantification of disease biomarkers in complex media is challenging. Here, a cheap handheld device was developed to realize on-site detection of disease biomarkers by Nd3+/Yb3+ co-doped near-infrared (NIR)-to-NIR downconversion nanoparticles (DCNPs) based LFA. Its sensitivity is at least 8-fold higher for detecting NIR light signal from Nd3+/Yb3+ co-doped nanoparticles than conventional expensive InGaAs camera based detection platform. Additionally, we enhance NIR quantum yield of Nd3+/Yb3+ co-doped nanoparticles up to 35.5% via simultaneous high dopant of sensitizer ions Nd3+ and emitter ions Yb3+. Combination of NIR-to-NIR handheld detection device and ultra-bright NIR emitting NaNbF4:Yb60%@NaLuF4 nanoparticle probe allows the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain and Omicron variants specific neutralizing antibodies LFA up to the level of commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit. Furthermore, by this robust method, enhanced neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain and Omicron variants are observed in healthy participants with Ad5-nCoV booster on top of two doses of inactivated vaccine. This NIR-to-NIR handheld platform provides a promising strategy for on-site evaluating protective humoral immunity after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or infection.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) is a potent immunogenic adjuvant and epitope display platform for the development of vaccines against cancers and infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019. However, the proteinaceous CPMV nanoparticles are rapidly degraded in vivo. Multiple doses are therefore required to ensure long-lasting immunity, which is not ideal for global mass vaccination campaigns. Therefore, we formulated CPMV nanoparticles in injectable hydrogels to achieve slow particle release and prolonged immunostimulation. Liquid formulations were prepared from chitosan and glycerophosphate (GP) before homogenization with CPMV particles at room temperature. The formulations containing high-molecular-weight chitosan and 0–4.5 mg mL–1 CPMV gelled rapidly at 37°C (5–8 min) and slowly released cyanine 5-CPMV particles in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, when a hydrogel containing CPMV displaying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein epitope 826 (amino acid 809–826) was administered to mice as a single subcutaneous injection, it elicited an antibody response that was sustained over 20 weeks, with an associated shift from Th1 to Th2 bias. Antibody titers were improved at later time points (weeks 16 and 20) comparing the hydrogel versus soluble vaccine candidates; furthermore, the soluble vaccine candidates retained Th1 bias. We conclude that CPMV nanoparticles can be formulated effectively in chitosan/GP hydrogels and are released as intact particles for several months with conserved immunotherapeutic efficacy. The injectable hydrogel containing epitope-labeled CPMV offers a promising single-dose vaccine platform for the prevention of future pandemics as well as a strategy to develop long-lasting plant virus-based nanomedicines.

AB  - As the world navigates the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is a growing need to assess its impact in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Patients with SLE are a unique population when considering the risk of contracting COVID-19 and infection outcomes. The use of systemic glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants, and underlying organ damage from SLE are potential susceptibility factors. Most patients with SLE have evidence of high type I interferon activity, which may theoretically act as an antiviral line of defense or contribute to the development of a deleterious hyperinflammatory response in COVID-19. Other immunopathogenic mechanisms of SLE may overlap with those described in COVID-19, thus, studies in SLE could provide some insight into immune responses occurring in severe cases of the viral infection. We reviewed the literature to date on COVID-19 in patients with SLE and provide an in-depth review of current research in the area, including immune pathway activation, epidemiology, clinical features, outcomes, and the psychosocial impact of the pandemic in those with autoimmune disease.
