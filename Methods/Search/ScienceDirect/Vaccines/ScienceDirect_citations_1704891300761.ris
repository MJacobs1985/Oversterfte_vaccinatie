AB  - Objectives
This study aimed to ascertain which factors are associated with higher risk of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 Bolivian patients.
Methods
This retrospective observational study assessed risk factors associated with mortality in patients (n = 549) hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a Bolivian hospital between April 6, 2020, and August 18, 2022.
Results
The results provide evidence of association between male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-2.6), older age, 51-61 years-old (OR = 5.2, 95% CI 2.2-12.6), 62-70 years-old (OR = 8.7, 95% CI 3.7-20.5), >70 years-old (OR = 16.9, 95% CI 7.1-39.9), and blood group A (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.4) with higher mortality risk. The strong association between mortality and relatively young age, may be due to high frequency of undiagnosed comorbidities. Vaccination was associated with a reduction in mortality only when time period of hospitalization was not adjusted for.
Conclusion
Among hospitalized patients in Bolivia male sex, older age, and blood group A are associated with higher mortality risk. Mortality risk increased markedly from a relatively young age and decreased in parallel to the uptake of the vaccination program. However, the gradual reduction in mortality can also be due to improved patient management and changes in natural immunity and virulence of circulating strains as the pandemic progressed.

AB  - Despite a recent endorsement from official and professional bodies unequivocally recommending COVID-19 vaccination, vaccine hesitancy among pregnant people remains high. The accumulated evidence demonstrates that pregnant people are a special risk group for COVID-19, with an increased risk of intensive care unit admission, extracorporeal membranous oxygenation requirement, preterm birth, and perinatal death. These risks are further increased with some variants of concern, and vaccination of pregnant people reduces the COVID-19–related increase in maternal or fetal morbidity. Data from more than 180,000 vaccinated persons show that immunization against COVID-19 with an mRNA vaccine is safe for pregnant people. Many observational studies comparing perinatal outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant people have had reassuring findings and did not demonstrate harmful effects on pregnancy or the newborn. Immunization with mRNA vaccines does not increase the risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, low birthweight, maternal or neonatal intensive care unit admission, fetal death, fetal abnormality, or pulmonary embolism. Moreover, observational data corroborate the findings of randomized trials that mRNA vaccination is highly effective at preventing severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant people, emphasizing that the potential maternal and fetal benefits of vaccination greatly outweigh the potential risks of vaccination. Ensuring pregnant people have unrestricted access to COVID-19 vaccination should be a priority in every country worldwide.

AB  - Whereas the extent of outbreak of COVID-19 is usually accessed via the number of reported cases and the number of patients succumbed to the disease, the officially recorded overall excess mortality numbers during the pandemic waves, which are significant and often followed the rise and fall of the pandemic waves, put a question mark on the above methodology. Gradually it has been recognized that estimating the size of the undiagnosed population (which includes asymptomatic cases and symptomatic cases but not reported) is also crucial. Here we used the classical mathematical SEIR model having an additional compartment, that is the undiagnosed group in addition to the susceptible, exposed, diagnosed, recovered and deceased groups, to link the undiagnosed COVID-19 cases to the reported excess mortality numbers and thereby try to know the actual size of the disease outbreak. The developed model wase successfully applied to relevant COVID-19 waves in USA (initial months of 2020), South Africa (mid of 2021) and Russia (2020–21) when a large discrepancy between the reported COVID-19 mortality and the overall excess mortality had been noticed.

AB  - People who inject drugs (PWID) may have diminished access to essential preventive services like COVID-19 vaccination given structural and substance use barriers. We aimed to assess the role of HIV on COVID-19 vaccination uptake among adult PWID participating in the ALIVE cohort study in Baltimore, Maryland who were alive as of April 2021. We abstracted COVID-19 vaccination data from electronic medical records via the regional health information exchange. We used Kaplan-Meier method to estimate time from universal vaccine eligibility (April 6, 2021) to completion of the COVID-19 vaccination primary series (1 dose J&J or 2 doses mRNA) by HIV viral load status (uninfected, PWH [HIV-RNA < 400 copies/mL], PWH [HIV-RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL]) and Cox Proportional Hazards regression to adjust for potential confounders. Our sample (N = 960) was primarily black (77%) and male (65%) with 31% reporting recent injection drug use. Among 265 (27%) people living with HIV (PWH) in our sample, 84% were virally suppressed. As of February 22, 2022, 539 (56%) completed the primary series, 131 (14%) received a single dose of mRNA vaccine and 290 (30%) remained unvaccinated. Compared to PWID without HIV, virally suppressed PWH were more likely to complete the primary series (Adjusted Hazard Ratio [aHR]:1.23,95% Confidence Interval [95 %CI]:1.07,1.50), while PWH who were not virally suppressed were less likely (aHR:0.72,95 %CI:0.45,1.16), although this was not statistically significant. We conclude that among PWID, HIV infection and viral suppression is associated with quicker vaccination uptake, likely due to HIV care engagement. Targeted improvements along the HIV care continuum may bolster vaccine uptake.

AB  - Summary
Background
Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) experienced reduced SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response and were at increased risk of severe COVID-19. It is unknown if level of vaccine induced anti-receptor binding domain IgG (anti-RBD IgG) correlates with protection from and survival following COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the effect of vaccine response on risk of breakthrough infections (BTI) and COVID-19 death in KTRs.
Methods
We performed a nationwide study, examining the competing risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related/unrelated death, and vaccine efficacy as assessed by level of anti-RBD IgG response 4–10 weeks after each vaccination. The study included all KTR in Norway alive and with a functioning graft on February 20th, 2020, and events after November 11th, 2022 were right-censored. A pre-pandemic reference-cohort from January 1st 2019 to January 1st 2020 was included to evaluate excess mortality. The study was conducted at Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Norway.
Findings
The study included 3607 KTRs (59 [48–70] years) with a functioning graft at February 20th, 2020, who received (median [IQR]) 4 [3–4] vaccines (range 2–6, 99% mRNA). Anti-RBD IgG was measured in 12 701 serum samples provided by 3213 KTRs. Vaccine response was assessed 41 [31–57] days after vaccination. A total of 1090 KTRs were infected with SARS-CoV-2, 1005 (92%) were BTI, and vaccine response did not protect against BTI. The hazard ratio for COVID-19 related death 40 days post-infection was 1.71 (95% CI: 1.14, 2.56) comparing vaccine response levels (≥5 vs. ≥5000 BAU/mL). No excess non-COVID-19 mortality was registered in KTRs surviving SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to a 2019 pre-pandemic reference.
Interpretation
Our findings suggested that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine response did not predict protection against infection, but prevention of fatal disease progression in KTRs and greater vaccine response further reduced the risk of COVID-19 death. No excess non-COVID-19 mortality was seen during the pandemic.

AB  - Rates of COVID deaths, hospitalizations, and cases differ markedly across U.S. states, as do rates of vaccination. This study uses cross-state regressions to assess impacts of vaccinations on COVID outcomes. A number of familiar issues arise concerning cross-sectional regressions, including omitted variables, behavioral responses to vaccination, and reverse causation. The benefits from a field context and from the broad range of observed variations suggest the value from dealing with these issues. Results reveal sizable negative effects of vaccination on deaths, hospitalizations, and cases up to early December 2021, although vaccine efficacy seems to wane over time. The findings for deaths apply to all-cause excess mortality as well as COVID-related mortality. The estimates imply that one expected life saved requires 248 additional doses, with a marginal cost around $55000, far below typical estimates of the value of a statistical life. Results since December 2021 suggest smaller effects of vaccinations on deaths and, especially, hospitalizations and cases, possibly because of diminished effectiveness of vaccines against new forms of the virus, notably the omicron variant. A further possibility is that confidence engendered by vaccinations motivated individuals and governments to lessen non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as masking and social distancing.

AB  - Objectives
To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the relative risk of COVID-19-related mortality among people with disabilities compared to people without disabilities.
Study design
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods
We systematically searched four databases from March 1, 2020, to August 15, 2022. We included prospective studies with a baseline assessment of disability and a longitudinal assessment of the COVID-19-related mortality. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook random-effects meta-analyses to calculate pooled adjusted hazard ratios for COVID-19-related mortality for people with disabilities, also disaggregated by disability type and study setting.
Results
We identified 2596 articles throughout the electronic data search, and 56 studies were included in the review. Most (73%) had a moderate risk of bias. The pooled adjusted effect estimate for COVID-19-related mortality in people with disabilities compared to those without was 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4–3.2). Heterogeneity between the studies was high (τ2 = 0.28, I2 = 97%). Effect estimates were highest for population-based samples (3.3, 95% CI: 2.7–3.9), compared to hospital settings (2.1, 95% CI: 1.7–2.7). Risk was not elevated among people with disabilities in care home settings (1.6, 95% CI: 0.7–3.5). Disaggregation by disability type showed that people with intellectual disabilities were at the highest relative risk of COVID-19 mortality.
Discussion
Risk of COVID-19 mortality is elevated among people with disabilities, especially people with intellectual disabilities. Efforts are needed to collect better routine data on disability and to include people with disabilities in the pandemic response for COVID-19.

AB  - Brazil was one of the countries most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a cumulative total of nearly 700,000 deaths by early 2023. The country's federative units were unevenly affected by the pandemic and adopted mitigation measures of different scopes and intensity. There was intense conflict between the federal government and state governments over the relevance and extent of such measures. We build a simple regression model with good predictive power on state COVID-19 mortality rates in Brazil. Our results reveal that the federative units' urbanization rate and per capita income are important for determining their mean mortality rate and that the number of physicians per 100,000 inhabitants is important for modeling the mortality rate precision. Based on the fitted model, we obtain approximations for the levels of administrative efficiency of local governments in dealing with the pandemic.

AB  - Introduction
We investigated the potential association of COVID-19 vaccination with three acute neurological events: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), transverse myelitis and Bell’s palsy.
Methods
With the approval of NHS England we analysed primary care data from >17 million patients in England linked to emergency care, hospital admission and mortality records in the OpenSAFELY platform. Separately for each vaccine brand, we used a self-controlled case series design to estimate the incidence rate ratio for each outcome in the period following vaccination (4–42 days for GBS, 4–28 days for transverse myelitis and Bell’s palsy) compared to a within-person baseline, using conditional Poisson regression.
Results
Among 7,783,441 ChAdOx1 vaccinees, there was an increased rate of GBS (N = 517; incidence rate ratio 2·85; 95% CI2·33–3·47) and Bell’s palsy (N = 5,350; 1·39; 1·27–1·53) following a first dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine, corresponding to 11.0 additional cases of GBS and 17.9 cases of Bell’s palsy per 1 million vaccinees if causal. For GBS this applied to the first, but not the second, dose. There was no clear evidence of an association of ChAdOx1 vaccination with transverse myelitis (N = 199; 1·51; 0·96–2·37). Among 5,729,152 BNT162b2 vaccinees, there was no evidence of any association with GBS (N = 283; 1·09; 0·75–1·57), transverse myelitis (N = 109; 1·62; 0·86–3·03) or Bell’s palsy (N = 3,609; 0·89; 0·76–1·03). Among 255,446 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients there was no evidence of an association with Bell’s palsy (N = 78; 0·88, 0·32–2·42).
Conclusions
COVID-19 vaccines save lives, but it is important to understand rare adverse events. We observed a short-term increased rate of Guillain-Barré syndrome and Bell’s palsy after first dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine. The absolute risk, assuming a causal effect attributable to vaccination, was low.

AB  - Background
Critical questions remain regarding the need for intensity to continue NPIs as the public was vaccinated. We evaluated the association of intensity and duration of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccines with COVID-19 infection, death, and excess mortality in Europe.
Methods
Data comes from Our Word in Data. We included 22 European countries from January 20, 2020, to May 30, 2021. The time-varying constrained distribution lag model was used in each country to estimate the impact of different intensities and duration of NPIs on COVID-19 control, considering vaccination coverage. Country-specific effects were pooled through meta-analysis.
Results
This study found that high-intensity and long-duration of NPIs showed a positive main effect on reducing infection in the absence of vaccines, especially in the intensity above the 80th percentile and lasted for 7 days (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.89–0.98). However, the adverse effect on excess mortality also increased with the duration and intensity. Specifically, it was associated with an increase of 44.16% (RR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.27–1.64) in the excess mortality under the strict intervention (the intensity above the 80th percentile and lasted for 21 days). As the vaccine rollouts, the inhibition of the strict intervention on cases growth rate was increased (RR dropped from 0.95 to 0.87). Simultaneously, vaccination also alleviated the negative impact of the strict intervention on excess mortality (RR decreased from 1.44 to 1.25). Besides, maintaining the strict intervention appeared to more reduce the cases, as well as avoids more overall burden of death compared with weak intervention.
Conclusions
Our study highlights the importance of continued high-intensity NPIs in low vaccine coverage. Lifting of NPIs in insufficient vaccination coverage may cause increased infections and death burden. Policymakers should coordinate the intensity and duration of NPIs and allocate medical resources reasonably with widespread vaccination.

Background
Official death toll related to COVID-19 has been considerably underestimated in reports from some Latin American countries. This study aimed to analyze the mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Costa Rica between March 2020 and December 2021.
Methods
A registry based study based on 2017–2021 data from the National Institute of Statistics and Census was designed (N = 128,106). Excess deaths were defined by the WHO as “the difference in the total number of deaths in a crisis compared to those expected under normal conditions”; and were estimated using a Poisson regression, and mortality and years of potential life lost (YPLL) rates were calculated.
Findings
The COVID-19 pandemic represented 15% of the deaths in Costa Rica between March 2020 and December 2021. The mortality rate related to COVID-19 was 83 per 100,000 person-years. Between March and July 2020 (low-incidence period), observed number of deaths was 9%-lower than expected, whereas it was 15% and 24% higher than expected between July 2020 and March 2021 (high incidence period - no vaccination), and between March 2021 and December 2021 (high incidence period – progressive vaccination) respectively. Between July 2020 and December 2021, excess deaths observed and COVID-19 deaths reported were comparable (7461 and 7620 respectively). Nevertheless, there were more deaths than expected for conditions that predispose to COVID-19 deaths. YPLL and mortality rates increased with age, but significant excess deaths were observed in all age-groups older than 30–39 years. No large differences were noted by districts’ socioeconomic characteristics although excess death rate was lower in rural compared to urban areas.
Interpretation
Reporting of deaths was only slightly underestimated. In the pre-vaccination period, mortality rate and YPLL rates increased with age, being highest in people aged 60 years or older and justifying the decision to initially prioritize vaccination of older individuals.
Funding
The study was supported by the University of Costa Rica and the Agencia Costarricense de Investigaciones Biomédicas – Fundación Inciensa.

AB  - This study proposes a decision support system (DSS) that integrates GIS, analytics, and simulation methods to help develop a priority-based distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in a large urban setting. The methodology applies novel hierarchical heuristic-simulation procedures to create a holistic algorithm for prioritising the process of demand allocation and optimising vaccine distribution. The Melbourne metropolitan area in Australia with a population of over five million is used as a case study. Three vaccine supply scenarios, namely limited, excessive, and disruption, were formulated to operationalise a two-dose vaccination program. Vaccine distribution with hard constraints were simulated and then further validated with sensitivity analyses. The results show that vaccines can be prioritised to society’s most vulnerable segments and distributed using the current logistics network with 10 vehicles. Compared with other vaccine distribution plans with no prioritisation, such as equal allocation of vaccines to local government areas based on population size or one on a first-come-first-serve basis, the plans generated by the proposed DSS ensure prioritised vaccination of the most needed and vulnerable population. The aim is to curb the spread of the infection and reduce mortality rate more effectively. They also achieve vaccination of the entire population with less logistical resources required. As such, this study contributes to knowledge and practice in pandemic vaccine distribution and enables governments to make real-time decisions and adjustments in daily distribution plans. In this way any unforeseen disruptions in the vaccine supply chain can be coped with.

AB  - Background
While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been well documented in high-income countries, less is known about the health effects in Somalia, where health systems are weak and vital registration is underdeveloped.
Methods
We used remote sensing and geospatial analysis to quantify burial numbers from January 2017 to September 2020 in Mogadishu. We imputed missing grave counts using surface area data. Simple interpolation and a generalised additive mixed growth model were used to predict actual and counterfactual burial rates by cemetery and across Mogadishu during the most likely period of COVID-19 excess mortality and to compute excess burials. We undertook a qualitative survey of key informants to determine the drivers of COVID-19 excess mortality.
Results
Burial rates increased during the pandemic, averaging 1.5-fold and peaking at a 2.2-fold increase on pre-pandemic levels. When scaled to plausible range of baseline crude death rates, the excess death toll between January and September 2020 was 3200–11 800. Compared with Barakaat Cemetery Committee's burial records, our estimates were lower.
Conclusions
Our study indicates considerable underestimation of the health effects of COVID-19 in Banadir and an overburdened public health system struggling to deal with the increasing severity of the epidemic in 2020.

AB  - The Delta-Omicron wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (Wave 4) in the United States occurred in Fall of 2021 through Spring of 2022. Although vaccinations were widely available, this was the deadliest period to date in the U.S., and the toll was especially high in rural areas, exacerbating an existing rural mortality penalty. This paper uses county-level multilevel regression models and publicly available data for 47 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. We describe differences in COVID-19 case and mortality rates across the rural-urban continuum during Wave 4 of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a progressive modeling approach, we evaluate the relative contribution of a range of explanatory factors for the rural disadvantage we observe, including: pre-pandemic population health composition, vaccination rates, political partisanship, socioeconomic composition, access to broadband internet rate, and primary care physicians per capita. Results show that rural counties had higher observed burdens of cases and deaths in Wave 4 compared to more urban counties. The most remote rural counties had Wave 4 COVID-19 mortality rates 52% higher than the most urban counties. Older age composition, worse pre-pandemic population health, lower vaccination rates, higher share of votes cast for Donald Trump in the 2020 Presidential election, and lower socioeconomic composition completely explained the rural disadvantage in reported COVID-19 case rates in Wave 4, and accounting for these factors reversed the observed rural disadvantage in COVID-19 mortality. In models of mortality rate, Trump vote share had the largest effect size, followed by the percentage of the population age 50 or older, the poverty rate, the pre-pandemic mortality rate, the share of residents with a 4-year college degree, and the vaccination rate. These findings add to a growing literature describing the disproportionate toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural America, highlighting the combined effect of multiple sources of rural disadvantage.

AB  - Summary
Background
During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, workers in essential sectors had higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mortality than those in non-essential sectors. It is unknown whether disparities in pandemic-related mortality across occupational sectors have continued to occur during the periods of SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccine availability.
Methods
In this longitudinal cohort study, we obtained data from the California Department of Public Health on all deaths occurring in the state of California, USA, from Jan 1, 2016, to Dec 31, 2021. We restricted our analysis to residents of California who were aged 18–65 years at time of death and died of natural causes. We classified the occupational sector into nine essential sectors; non-essential; or unemployed or without an occupation provided on the death certificate. We calculated the number of COVID-19 deaths in total and per capita that occurred in each occupational sector. Separately, using autoregressive integrated moving average models, we estimated total, per-capita, and relative excess natural-cause mortality by week between March 1, 2020, and Nov 30, 2021, stratifying by occupational sector. We additionally stratified analyses of occupational risk into counties with high versus low vaccine uptake, categorising high-uptake regions as counties where at least 50% of the population were fully vaccinated according to US guidelines by Aug 1, 2021.
Findings
From March 1, 2020, to Nov 30, 2021, 24 799 COVID-19 deaths were reported in residents of California aged 18–65 years and an estimated 28 751 (95% prediction interval 27 853–29 653) excess deaths. People working in essential sectors were associated with higher COVID-19 deaths and excess deaths than were those working in non-essential sectors, with the highest per-capita COVID-19 mortality in the agriculture (131·8 per 100 000 people), transportation or logistics (107·1 per 100 000), manufacturing (103·3 per 100 000), facilities (101·1 per 100 000), and emergency (87·8 per 100 000) sectors. Disparities were wider during periods of increased infections, including during the Nov 29, 2020, to Feb 27, 2021, surge in infections, which was driven by the delta variant (B.1.617.2) and occurred during vaccine uptake. During the June 27 to Nov 27, 2021 surge, emergency workers had higher COVID-19 mortality (113·7 per 100 000) than workers from any other sector. Workers in essential sectors had the highest COVID-19 mortality in counties with low vaccination uptake, a difference that was more pronounced during the period of the delta infection surge during Nov 29, 2020, to Feb 27, 2021.
Interpretation
Workers in essential sectors have continued to bear the brunt of high COVID-19 and excess mortality throughout the pandemic, particularly in the agriculture, emergency, manufacturing, facilities, and transportation or logistics sectors. This high death toll has continued during periods of vaccine availability and the delta surge. In an ongoing pandemic without widespread vaccine coverage and with anticipated threats of new variants, the USA must actively adopt policies to more adequately protect workers in essential sectors.

AB  - In a recent modeling study Watson et al. (Lancet Infect Dis 2022;3099:1-10) claim that Covid-19 vaccinations have helped to prevent roughly 14–20 million deaths in 2021. This conclusion is based on an epidemiological susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model trained on partially simulated data and yielding a reproduction number distribution which was then applied to a counterfactual scenario in which the efficacy of vaccinations was removed. Drawing on the meta-theory of Critical Realism, we point out several caveats of this model and caution against believing in its predictions. We argue that the absence of vaccinations would have significantly changed the causal tendencies of the system being modelled, yielding a different reproduction number than obtained from training the model on actually observed data. Furthermore, the model omits many important causal factors. Therefore this model, similar to many previous SEIR models, has oversimplified the complex interplay between biomedical, social and cultural dimensions of health and should not be used to guide public health policy. In order to predict the future in epidemic situations more accurately, continuously optimized dynamic causal models which can include the not directly tangible, yet real causal mechanisms affecting public health appear to be a promising alternative to SEIR-type models.

AB  - Background
Myocarditis secondary to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination has been reported in the literature.
Objective
This study aimed to characterize the reported cases of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination based on age, gender, doses, and vaccine type from published literature and the EudraVigilance database.
Methods
We performed an analysis in the EudraVigilance database (until December 18, 2021) and a systematic review of published literature for reported cases of suspected myocarditis and pericarditis (until 30th June 2022) after the COVID-19 vaccination.
Results
EudraVigilance database analysis revealed 16,514 reported cases of myocarditis or pericarditis due to the vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines. The cases of myo- or pericarditis were reported predominantly in the age group of 18–64 (n = 12,214), and in males with a male-to-female (M: F) ratio of 1.7:1. The mortality among myocarditis patients was low, with 128 deaths (2 cases per 10.000.000 administered doses) being reported. For the systematic review, 72 studies with 1026 cases of myocarditis due to the vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines were included. The analysis of published cases has revealed that the male gender was primarily affected with myocarditis post-COVID-vaccination. The median (IQR) age of the myocarditis cases was 24.6 [19.5–34.6] years, according to the systematic review of the literature. Myocarditis cases were most frequently published after the vaccination with m-RNA vaccines and after the second vaccination dose. The overall mortality of published cases was low (n = 5).
Conclusion
Myocarditis is a rare serious adverse event associated with a COVID-19 vaccination. With early recognition and management, the prognosis of COVID-19 vaccine-induced myocarditis is favorable.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic in the US has been particularly devastating for nursing home residents. A key question is how have some nursing homes been able to effectively protect their residents, while others have not? Using data on the universe of US nursing homes, we examine whether establishment quality is predictive of COVID-19 mortality. Higher-quality nursing homes, as measured by CMS overall five-star rating, have substantially lower COVID-19 mortality through September of 2020. Quality does not predict the ability to prevent any COVID-19 resident or staff cases, but higher-quality establishments prevent the spread of resident infections conditional on having one. Preventing COVID-19 cases and deaths may come at some cost, as high-quality homes have substantially higher non-COVID deaths. The positive correlation between establishment quality and non-COVID mortality is strong enough that high-quality homes also have more total deaths than their low-quality counterparts and this relationship has grown with time. As of late April 2021, five-star homes have experienced 8.4 percent more total deaths than one-star homes.

KW  - Cross-sectional study
AB  - Background
Equity in vaccination against COVID-19 is a public health concern. The objective of this study was to analyze socioeconomic inequalities related to vaccination for the first and second doses from primary series against COVID-19 in Ecuador.
Methods
Secondary database study in 12,743,507 respondents from 15 years and over. The COVID-19 section of the National Survey of Employment, Unemployment and Underemployment (ENEMDU) was analyzed. Socioeconomic characteristics and vaccination against COVID-19 were associated with the at least one dose and second dose. Poisson regressions for complex samples were obtained.
Results
As of the date of the survey, 87.3% of the sample (95% CI 86.7%-87.8%) had received at least one vaccine against COVID-19. A lower probability of having received at least one vaccine against COVID-19 was found in rural areas (PR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74–0.91), indigenous population (PR 0.43, 95% CI 0.29–0.64), no level of education (PR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14–0.43), and the lowest economic income (PR 0.42, 95% CI 0.35–0.52). A significantly lower probability of vaccination with two or more doses was found in rural vs urban area (PR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80–0.96), women vs men (PR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77–0.91), indigenous population vs white (PR 0.44, 95% CI 0.33–0.59) and individuals in the lowest income quartile vs highest income quartile (PR 0.48, 95% CI 0.42–0.55). Underemployment, population economically inactive (PR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67–0.88 and PR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61–0.83) and individuals with no level of education (PR 0.39, 95% CI 0.27–0.58) also were less likely to complete the primary phase of vaccination compared with individuals in the highest income quartile, employment and postgraduate level of education.
Conclusions
There were socioeconomic inequalities with the primary series of vaccine against COVID-19, with a greater disadvantage for rural residents, women, indigenous populations, lower economic income and lower levels of education.

AB  - Background
Although many studies have found a high correlation between socio-economic inequalities and risk of COVID-19 deaths, there is a reason to believe that much of this association is the product of differing levels of education.
Study design
We use a multi-level negative binomial regression model for analyzing COVID-19 mortality.
Methods
We present multivariate models of fortnightly (n = 60) COVID-19 deaths in 3108 US counties for the period January 20, 2020, to May 10, 2022. We model the direct (unmediated) effect of education, controlling for economy, race, geography, lack of vaccination, political orientation (vote Republican), poor health, and lack of preventative health behavior.
Results
After controlling for correlated risk factors and indirect mechanisms that mediate education's impact on COVID-19 mortality, we find a strong direct (unmediated) correlation between low education and COVID-19 mortality (incidence rate ratio = 1.17; 95% confidence interval: 1.15, 1.20). We theorize that this correlation reflects education's relationship with (1) collective cultures, such as norms of mask wearing, and (2) individual literacy, such as ability to engage with scientific communication.
Conclusions
Low education is strongly correlated with COVID-19 deaths, with an effect size of a university degree comparable to that of being aged >65 years. If this correlation is indeed causal, then it would imply that low education accounts for between 1 in 10 and 1 in 7 deaths in low-education counties. Education should be conceptualized as a potential high-risk factor for COVID-19 death and be taken into account when attempting to combat COVID-19 in disadvantaged communities. The effect of education cannot be reduced to its impact on vaccination or correlation with poor health or economic status, but it seems likely that low-education communities have collective cultures that expose individuals to greater risks and lack of individual literacy that limits engagement with public health messaging.

AB  - Objective
To examine whether epilepsy-related deaths increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and if the proportion with COVID-19 listed as the underlying cause is different between people experiencing epilepsy-related deaths and those experiencing deaths unrelated to epilepsy.
Methods
This was a Scotland-wide, population-based, cross-sectional study of routinely-collected mortality data pertaining to March–August of 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic peak) compared to the corresponding periods in 2015–2019. ICD-10-coded causes of death of deceased people of any age were obtained from a national mortality registry of death certificates in order to identify those experiencing epilepsy-related deaths (coded G40–41), deaths with COVID-19 listed as a cause (coded U07.1–07.2), and deaths unrelated to epilepsy (death without G40–41 coded). The number of epilepsy-related deaths in 2020 were compared to the mean observed through 2015–2019 on an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model (overall, men, women). Proportionate mortality and odds ratios (OR) for deaths with COVID-19 listed as the underlying cause were determined for the epilepsy-related deaths compared to deaths unrelated to epilepsy, reporting 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Results
A mean number of 164 epilepsy-related deaths occurred through March–August of 2015–2019 (of which a mean of 71 were in women and 93 in men). There were subsequently 189 epilepsy-related deaths during the pandemic March–August 2020 (89 women, 100 men). This was 25 more epilepsy-related deaths (18 women, 7 men) compared to the mean through 2015–2019. The increase in women was beyond the mean year-to-year variation seen in 2015–2019. Proportionate mortality with COVID-19 listed as the underlying cause was similar between people experiencing epilepsy-related deaths (21/189, 11.1%, CI 7.0–16.5%) and deaths unrelated to epilepsy (3,879/27,428, 14.1%, CI 13.7–14.6%), OR 0.76 (CI 0.48–1.20). Ten of 18 excess epilepsy-related deaths in women had COVID-19 listed as an additional cause.
Conclusions
There is little evidence to suggest there have been any major increases in epilepsy-related deaths in Scotland during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is a common underlying cause of both epilepsy-related and unrelated deaths.

AB  - Objective
We aimed to determine how municipal subsidies for seasonal influenza vaccines for the elderly affected vaccination coverage and health outcomes and how responses to vaccine prices changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Study design and methods
This ecological study includes 1245 municipalities in Japan between 2019 and 2020. Fixed-effects regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of influenza vaccine cost subsidy for people aged 65 years or older on vaccination coverage, all-cause mortality, and influenza-related mortality.
Results
The vaccination rate increased when patients' copayments decreased, and reducing the copayment by 1000 Japanese Yen (JPY) was estimated to increase the vaccination rate by 6.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.5–8.2%) in the adjusted model. When examining the additional effect of a zero price compared to a nearly zero price, we found that a zero price increased the immunization rate by 6.4% (95% CI 1.4–11.5%). The effect of copayment on the increase in vaccination coverage was significantly lower during the pandemic than in the pre-pandemic period. The municipal and prefectural analyses found no association between influenza vaccine copayments and all-cause, influenza, or pneumonia mortality.
Conclusion
Cost subsidies and the zero-price effect were shown to increase vaccination coverage but were not associated with relevant mortality measures. Although the impact was attenuated under pandemic conditions, cost subsidy effectively increases the vaccination rate.

AB  - Objective
We investigated whether COVID-19 vaccination had an impact on diabetes risk.
Methods
We used data of 6,198 patients (mean age 64.3 years) from the nationwide Disease Analyzer database, a representative panel of physicians’ practices in Germany. Patients received their first COVID-19 vaccination between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022, and all were newly diagnosed with diabetes within 183 days before or after this vaccination. Incident rates of diabetes after vaccination were compared to incident rates before vaccination.
Results
The incidence rate of diabetes was lower after vaccination than before vaccination (incidence rate ratio = 0.79, 95% confidence interval: 0.75–0.83). The number of incident cases of diabetes was not greater in 2021 than in 2019.
Conclusion
Our study did not confirm an increased risk of diabetes after COVID-19 vaccination. Further studies are needed to show whether the vaccination may be associated with a reduced diabetes risk.

We will take into consideration the ways in which people from four different age ranges react to the virus. Using an appropriate transmission function, we estimate the impact of the third surge of COVID-19 in Italy. Also, we assess two different vaccination programmes. In one of them, a single shot is administered to all citizens over 16 years old before second shots are available. In the second model, first and second shots are administered to each citizen within, approximately, 20 days of time-gap.

AB  - Background: Vaccination against COVID-19 in Brazil started in January 2021, with health workers and the elderly as the priority groups. We assessed whether there was an impact of vaccinations on the mortality of elderly individuals in a context of wide transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 gamma (P.1) variant. Methods: By May 15, 2021, 238,414 COVID-19 deaths had been reported to the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Denominators for mortality rates were calculated by correcting population estimates for all-cause deaths reported in 2020. Proportionate mortality at ages 70–79 and 80+ years relative to deaths at all ages were calculated for deaths due to COVID-19 and to other causes, as were COVID-19 mortality rate ratios relative to individuals aged 0–69 years. Vaccine coverage data were obtained from the Ministry of Health. All results were tabulated by epidemiological weeks 1–19, 2021. Findings: The proportion of all COVID-19 deaths at ages 80+ years was over 25% in weeks 1–6 and declined rapidly to 12.4% in week 19, whereas proportionate COVID-19 mortality for individuals aged 70–79 years started to decline by week 15. Trends in proportionate mortality due to other causes remained stable. Mortality rates were over 13 times higher in the 80+ years age group compared to that of 0–69 year olds up to week 6, and declined to 5.0 times in week 19. Vaccination coverage (first dose) of 90% was reached by week 9 for individuals aged 80+ years and by week 13 for those aged 70–79 years. Coronavac accounted for 65.4% and AstraZeneca for 29.8% of all doses administered in weeks 1–4, compared to 36.5% and 53.3% in weeks 15–19, respectively. Interpretation: Rapid scaling up of vaccination coverage among elderly Brazilians was associated with important declines in relative mortality compared to younger individuals, in a setting where the gamma variant predominates. Had mortality rates among the elderly remained proportionate to what was observed up to week 6, an estimated additional 43,802 COVID-related deaths would have been expected up to week 19. Funding: CGV and AJDB are funded by the Todos pela Saúde (São Paulo, Brazil) initiative.

AB  - Summary
Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections of vaccinated individuals are being reported globally, resulting in an increased risk of hospitalization and death among such patients. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the modifiable risk factors that may affect the protective efficacy of vaccine use against the development of severe COVID-19 and thus to initiate early medical interventions. Here, in population-based studies using the UK Biobank database and the 2021 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), we analyzed 20,362 participants aged 50 years or older and 2,588 aged 18 years or older from both databases who tested positive for SARS-COV-2, of whom 33.1% and 67.7% received one or more doses of vaccine, respectively. In the UK Biobank, participants are followed from the vaccination date until October 18, 2021. We found that obesity and metabolic abnormalities (namely, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension) were modifiable factors for severe COVID-19 in vaccinated patients (all p < 0.05). When metabolic abnormalities were present, regardless of obesity, the risk of severe COVID-19 was higher than that of metabolically normal individuals (all p < 0.05). Moreover, pharmacological interventions targeting such abnormalities (namely, antihypertensive [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.48–0.86; p = 0.003], glucose-lowering [aHR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36–0.83; p = 0.004], and lipid-lowering treatments [aHR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37–0.68; p < 0.001]) were significantly associated with a reduced risk for this outcome. These results show that more proactive health management of patients with obesity and metabolic abnormalities is critical to reduce the incidence of severe COVID-19 after vaccination.

AB  - Background
There have been concerns about COVID-19 vaccination safety among frail older individuals. We investigated the relationship between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and mortality among individuals aged ≥ 70 years and whether mortality varies across four groups of health services used.
Methods
In this nationwide cohort study, we included 688,152 individuals aged ≥ 70 years at the start of the Norwegian vaccination campaign (December 27, 2020). We collected individual-level data from theNorwegian Emergency Preparedness Register for COVID-19. Vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were matched (1:1 ratio) on the date of vaccination based on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. The main outcome was all-cause mortality during 21 days after first dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. Kaplan-Meier survival functions were estimated for the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. We used Cox proportional-hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of death between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), overall and by use of health services (none, home-based, short- and long-term nursing homes) and age group.
Results
Between December 27, 2020, and March 31, 2021, 420,771 older individuals (61.1%) were vaccinated against COVID-19. The Kaplan-Meier estimates based on the matched study sample showed a small absolute risk difference in all-cause mortality between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, with a lower mortality in the vaccinated group (overall HR 0.28 [95% CI: 0.24–0.31]). Similar results were obtained in analyses stratified by use of health services and age group.
Conclusion
We found no evidence of increased short-term mortality among vaccinated individuals in the older population after matching on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics affecting vaccination and mortality.

AB  - Abstract
Objectives
SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic, with little prevention or treatment options. More than 600 million mortalities have been documented from SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the majority of fatalities occurring among elderly patients (aged >65 years). A number of vaccines have been developed in an effort to restrain the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the widespread administration of these vaccines, substantial side or undesired effects in multiple organ systems have emerged, necessitating essential critical care. Herein, we tabulate the adverse cardiovascular responses resulting from COVID-19 vaccines.
Design or Methods
We searched PubMed for articles published through April, 2022, with the terms “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “cardiovascular”, “SARS-CoV-2 vaccines”, “COVID-19 vaccines”, “myocarditis”, “pericarditis”, “thrombosis”, “thrombocytopenia”, “vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia”, “acute coronary syndrome”, “myocardial infarction”, “hypertension”, “arrythmia”, “postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome”, “Takotsubo cardiomyopathy”, “cardiac arrest” and “death”. We mainly selected publications from the past 3 years, but did not exclude widely referenced and highly regarded older publications. Besides, we searched the reference lists of articles identified by above search method and chose those we considered relevant.
Results
COVID-19 vaccines evoke rare but fatal thrombotic events, whereas messenger RNA\055based vaccines appear to be associated with risks of pericarditis/myocarditis, with the latter being more predominant in young adults following the second dose. Reports of other cardiovascular responses, including hypertension, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, and cardiac arrest, have also been indicated.
Conclusion
The undesired cardiovascular complications remain infrequent, giveng the large number of vaccinations inoculated to general population. And lower mortality takes precedence over the undesired cardiovascular complications.

AB  - We study the role of education during the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. We compare excess mortality in 2020 and 2021 compared to the pre-pandemic mortality between municipalities with different shares of educated residents. We find that education initially played a strong protective role, which however quickly faded out. After pondering several alternative explanations, we tentatively interpret this finding as the outcome of the interplay between education, information and public health communication, whose availability and coherence varied along the epidemic.

AB  - Objectives
In the first months of 2021, the Dutch COVID-19 vaccination campaign was disturbed by reports of death in Norwegian nursing homes (NHs) after vaccination. Reports predominantly concerned persons >65 years of age with 1 or more comorbidities. Also, in the Netherlands adverse events were reported after COVID-19 vaccination in this vulnerable group. Yet, it was unclear whether a causal link between vaccination and death existed. Therefore, we investigated the risk of death after COVID-19 vaccination in Dutch NH residents compared with the risk of death in NH residents prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Design
Population-based longitudinal cohort study with electronic health record data.
Setting and Participants
We studied Dutch NH residents from 73 NHs who received 1 or 2 COVID-19 vaccination(s) between January 13 and April 16, 2021 (n = 21,762). As a historical comparison group, we included Dutch NH residents who were registered in the same period in 2019 (n = 27,591).
Methods
Data on vaccination status, age, gender, type of care, comorbidities, and date of NH entry and (if applicable) discharge or date of death were extracted from electronic health records. Risk of death after 30 days was evaluated and compared between vaccinated residents and historical comparison residents with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Regression analyses were adjusted for age, gender, comorbidities, and length of stay.
Results
Risk of death in NH residents after one COVID-19 vaccination (regardless of whether a second vaccination was given) was decreased compared with historical comparison residents from 2019 (adjusted HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.86). The risk of death further decreased after 2 vaccinations compared with the historical comparison group (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.50-0.64).
Conclusions and Implications
We found no indication that risk of death in NH residents is increased after COVID-19 vaccination. These results indicate that COVID-19 vaccination in NH residents is safe and could reduce fear and resistance toward vaccination.

AB  - Background
The safety of COVID-19 vaccines plays an important role in addressing vaccine hesitancy. We conducted a large cohort study to evaluate the risk of non-COVID-19 mortality after COVID-19 vaccination while adjusting for confounders including individual-level demographics, clinical risk factors, health care utilization, and community-level socioeconomic risk factors.
Methods
The retrospective cohort study consisted of members from seven Vaccine Safety Datalink sites from December 14, 2020 through August 31, 2021. We conducted three separate analyses for each of the three COVID-19 vaccines used in the US. Crude non-COVID-19 mortality rates were reported by vaccine type, age, sex, and race/ethnicity. The counting process model for survival analyses was used to analyze non-COVID-19 mortality where a new observation period began when the vaccination status changed upon receipt of the first dose and the second dose. We used calendar time as the basic time scale in survival analyses to implicitly adjust for season and other temporal trend factors. A propensity score approach was used to adjust for the potential imbalance in confounders between the vaccinated and comparison groups.
Results
For each vaccine type and across age, sex, and race/ethnicity groups, crude non-COVID-19 mortality rates among COVID-19 vaccinees were lower than those among comparators. After adjusting for confounders with the propensity score approach, the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were 0.46 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44–0.49) after dose 1 and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.46–0.50) after dose 2 of the BNT162b2 vaccine, 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39–0.44) after dose 1 and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.37–0.40) after dose 2 of the mRNA-1273 vaccine, and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.51–0.59) after receipt of Ad26.COV2.S.
Conclusion
While residual confounding bias remained after adjusting for several individual-level and community-level risk factors, no increased risk was found for non-COVID-19 mortality among recipients of three COVID-19 vaccines used in the US.

AB  - Summary
Background
The dominant effect of age on COVID-19 mortality obscures the impact of other risk factors. Although the elderly is at a greater risk of severe disease and death due to COVID-19, the interaction of obesity and age was not carefully assessed. This analysis is especially critical for prioritizing groups to receive COVID-19 vaccination.
Methods
Starting with 1,120,767 unvaccinated individuals registered in a Brazilian surveillance system, we selected 313,898 hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 20 to 89 who had a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) or diabetes, as well as individuals with no risk factors associated with severe COVID-19. Patient data were stratified by age, obesity, BMI, and comorbidities, and subsequently, subjected to crude and adjusted odds ratio, hazard ratio, and Kaplan–Meier curves. Disease outcomes were invasive and non-invasive ventilatory support, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death.
Findings
Obesity alone is a risk factor for in-hospital mortality and is more significant than cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Furthermore, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes increase the risk of severity and death by COVID-19 more significantly in young adults than in the elderly. When categorizing patients by obesity classes, the severity of obesity was found to be associated with a higher risk of admission to the ICU and death from COVID-19 than the non-obese young adults or elderly population.
Interpretation
Our findings highlight the increased risk of severe COVID-19 on the Brazilian obese youth. As SARS-CoV-2 may become a recurrent seasonal infection, future vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 should prioritize obese young individuals.

AB  - Objectives
This study analysed the association between social and ideological determinants with COVID-19 vaccine accessibility and hesitancy in the Spanish adult population.
Study design
This was a repeated cross-sectional study.
Methods
The data analysed are based on monthly surveys conducted by the Centre for Sociological Research between May 2021 and February 2022. Individuals were classified according to their COVID-19 vaccination status into (1) vaccinated (reference group); (2) willing to vaccinate but not vaccinated, proxy of lack of vaccine accessibility; and (3) hesitant, proxy of vaccine hesitancy. Independent variables included social (educational attainment, gender) and ideological determinants (voting in the last elections, importance attached to the health vs the economic impact of the pandemic, and political self-placement). We estimated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) conducting one age-adjusted multinomial logistic regression model for each determinant and then stratified them by gender.
Results
Both social and ideological determinants had a weak association with the lack of vaccine accessibility. Individuals with medium educational attainment had higher odds of vaccine hesitancy (OR = 1.44, CI 1.08–1.93) compared with those with high educational attainment. People self-identified as conservative (OR = 2.90; CI 2.02–4.15) and those who prioritised the economic impact (OR = 3.80; CI 2.62–5.49) and voted for parties opposed to the Government (OR = 2.00; CI 1.54–2.60) showed higher vaccine hesitancy. The stratified analysis showed a similar pattern for both men and women.
Conclusions
Considering the determinants of vaccine uptake and hesitancy could help to design strategies that increase immunisation at the population level and minimise health inequities.

AB  - Objectives
Elderly patients with hematologic malignancies face the highest risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. The infection's impact on different age groups remains unstudied in detail.
Methods
We analyzed elderly patients (age groups: 65-70, 71-75, 76-80, and >80 years old) with hematologic malignancies included in the EPICOVIDEHA registry between January 2020 and July 2022. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were conducted to identify factors influencing death in COVID-19 patients with hematological malignancy.
Results
The study included data from 3,603 elderly patients (aged 65 or older) with hematological malignancy, with a majority being male (58.1%) and a significant proportion having comorbidities. The patients were divided into four age groups, and the analysis assessed COVID-19 outcomes, vaccination status, and other variables in relation to age and pandemic waves. The 90-day survival rate for patients with COVID-19 was 71.2%, with significant differences between groups. The pandemic waves had varying impacts, with the first wave affecting patients over 80 years old, the second being more severe in 65-70, and the third being the least severe in all age groups. Factors contributing to 90-day mortality included age, comorbidities, lymphopenia, active malignancy, acute leukemia, less than three vaccine doses, severe COVID-19, and using only corticosteroids as treatment.
Conclusion
These data underscore the heterogeneity of elderly hematological patients, highlight the different impacts of COVID-19 waves and the pivotal importance of vaccination, and may help in planning future healthcare efforts.

AB  - This study analyzes the impact of COVID-19 full vaccination shocks on the US stock market in the period January 14, 2021– August 20, 2021. Using the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag model, we find that the positive and negative COVID-19 full vaccination growth shocks have a positive and symmetrical impact on the US stock market over the long run. Additionally, the short-run findings provide that the US stock market reacts negatively with delay to the positive and negative COVID-19 full vaccination growth shocks. The study findings provide good insights that COVID-19 full vaccination immunizes accordingly to the S&P 500 index in the long run. The study results indicate that the impact of positive and negative COVID-19 full vaccination growth shocks on the stock market in the short run differs from that in the long run. This research bears important implications: governments should implement preventive measures with vaccination to recover the stock market. Policy makers ought to urge adopting policy measures to reduce panic and boost investor confidence during economic and health crises.

AB  - Objective
The association of serious mental illness (affective or non-affective psychotic disorders) with higher mortality in patients infected with acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been suggested. Although this association remains significant after adjusting for medical comorbidities in previous studies, admission clinical status and treatment modalities should be considered as important confounding factors.
Methods
We aimed to assess whether serious mental illness is associated with in-hospital mortality, in patients with COVID-19 by adjusting for comorbidities, admission clinical status, and treatment modalities. Our nationwide cohort in Japan included consecutive patients admitted to 438 acute care hospitals for laboratory-confirmed acute COVID-19 from January 1, 2020 to November 30, 2021.
Results
Of 67,348 hospitalized patients (mean [standard deviation] age, 54 [18.6] years; 3891 [53.0%] female), 2524 patients (3.75%) had serious mental illness. In-hospital mortality was 282/2524 (11.17%) among patients with serious mental illness, while it was 2118/64,824 (3.27%) in other patients. In the fully adjusted model, serious mental illness was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.27–1.72). E-value analysis confirmed the robustness of the results.
Conclusion
Serious mental illness remains a risk for mortality in acute COVID-19 after adjusting for comorbidities, admission clinical status, and treatment modalities. Vaccination, diagnosis, early assessment and treatment should be prioritized for this vulnerable group.

AB  - We assessed the relationship between the altitude of municipalities and the incidence, mortality, and fatality from COVID-19 and excess of mortality in Colombia between 2020 and 2022. We conducted an ecologic study including all 1122 municipalities in Colombia and used categories of altitude as main independent variable. We fit multivariable regression models for incidence, mortality, fatality rates, and excess of mortality controlling for several variables at municipality level. There was a higher incidence rate, similar mortality rate and lower case-fatality rate for COVID-19 during 2020–2022 in municipalities in the upper category of altitude (>=2500 masl) compared to the lower category (<1000 masl). The excess of mortality was lower but not statistically different in municipalities in the upper category of altitude, and significantly lower in the intermediate altitude category compared to the lowlands. Our findings provide evidence that municipalities with high altitude had similar mortality rate, and lower case-fatality rate and excess of mortality for COVID-19 compared to lowlands in Colombia.

AB  - Recent studies have established the key individual-level risk factors of COVID-19 mortality such as age, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. However, the spread of infectious diseases is a spatial and temporal process implying that COVID-19 mortality and its determinants may vary sub-nationally and over time. We investigate the spatial patterns of age-standardised death rates due to COVID-19 and their correlates across local authority districts in England, Wales, and Scotland across three waves of infection. Using a Spatial Durbin model, we explore within- and between-country variation and account for spatial dependency. Areas with a higher share of ethnic minorities and higher levels of deprivation had higher rates of COVID-19 mortality. However, the share of ethnic minorities and population density in an area were more important predictors of COVID-19 mortality in earlier waves of the pandemic than in later waves, whereas area-level deprivation has become a more important predictor over time. Second, during the first wave of the pandemic, population density had a significant spillover effect on COVID-19 mortality, indicating that the pandemic spread from big cities to neighbouring areas. Third, after accounting for differences in ethnic composition, deprivation, and population density, initial cross-country differences in COVID-19 mortality almost disappeared. COVID-19 mortality remained higher in Scotland than in England and Wales in the third wave when COVID-19 mortality was relatively low in all three countries. Interpreting these results in the context of higher overall (long-term) non-COVID-19 mortality in Scotland suggests that Scotland may have performed better than expected during the first two waves. Our study highlights that accounting for both spatial and temporal factors is essential for understanding social and demographic risk factors of mortality during pandemics.

AB  - Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted vaccination services and raised the risk of a global resurgence of preventable diseases. We assessed the extent of and reasons for missed or delayed vaccinations (hereafter ‘missed’) in middle- and high-income countries in the early months of the pandemic.
Methods
From May to June 2020, participants completed an online survey on missed vaccination. Analyses separated missed childhood and adult vaccination in middle-and high-income countries.
Results
Respondents were 28,429 adults from 26 middle- and high-income countries. Overall, 9% of households had missed a vaccine, and 13% were unsure. More households in middle- than high-income countries reported missed childhood vaccination (7.6% vs. 3.0%) and missed adult vaccination (9.6% vs. 3.4%, both p < .05). Correlates of missed childhood vaccination in middle-income countries included COVID-19 risk factors (respiratory and cardiovascular diseases), younger age, male sex, employment, psychological distress, larger household size, and more children. In high-income countries, correlates of missed childhood vaccination also included immunosuppressive conditions, but did not include sex or household size. Fewer correlates were associated with missed adult vaccination other than COVID-19 risk factors and psychological distress. Common reasons for missed vaccinations were worry about getting COVID-19 at the vaccination clinic (15%) or when leaving the house (11%). Other reasons included no healthcare provider recommendation, clinic closure, and wanting to save services for others.
Interpretation
Missed vaccination was common and more prevalent in middle- than high-income countries. Missed vaccination could be mitigated by emphasizing COVID-19 safety measures in vaccination clinics, ensuring free and accessible immunization, and clear healthcare provider recommendations.

AB  - In this paper we ask how to best allocate a given time-varying supply of vaccines during the second phase of the Covid-19 pandemic across individuals of different ages. Building on our previous heterogeneous household model of optimal economic mitigation and redistribution (Glover et al., 2021) we contrast the actual vaccine deployment path that prioritized older, retired individuals with one that first vaccinates younger workers. Vaccinating the old first saves more lives but slows the economic recovery, relative to inoculating the young first. Vaccines deliver large welfare benefits in both scenarios (relative to a world without vaccines), but the old-first policy is optimal under a utilitarian social welfare function. The welfare gains from having vaccinated the old first are especially significant once the economy is hit by a more infectious Delta variant in the summer of 2021.

AB  - Objectives
To analyze how the vaccines and various measures to control the pandemic affected epidemiological, health and socioeconomic outcomes of COVID-19 in Finland. The focus of the analysis is on the endemic phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
The paper provides an overview of Finland's healthcare system, trends in COVID-19 morbidity, mortality and vaccination coverage data, political considerations, interventions to control the pandemic, as well as the economic impact of the pandemic in the endemic phase. Data were collected from various sources, including previous studies, government reports, national statistics and registers and general media.
Results
In Finland, the total number of COVID-19 infections increased significantly during 2022, but the number of serious forms of the disease decreased. The implementation of the vaccination strategy caused a diversity of opinions among authorities and experts. The governing of the pandemic was fully decentralized. Overall, there is a good vaccination coverage of the population. In the endemic phase society returned to live without restrictions.
Conclusions
It seems clear that vaccines played an important role in controlling the pandemic. Overall mortality increased substantially in 2022 causing life expectancy to fall. Moreover, different “excess death” indicators show an increase in 2021 and 2022, but the timing and magnitude of the effect varies. It is relatively safe to conclude that at least part of increase can be attributed to the pandemic, but a more exact conclusion calls for a comprehensive study. Similarly, understanding long covid and designing required intervention calls for more research.

AB  - Excess mortality has been used to measure the impact of COVID-19 over time and across countries. But what baseline should be chosen? We propose two novel approaches: an alternative retrospective baseline derived from the lowest weekly death rates achieved in previous years and a within-year baseline based on the average of the 13 lowest weekly death rates within the same year. These baselines express normative levels of the lowest feasible target death rates. The excess death rates calculated from these baselines are not distorted by past mortality peaks and do not treat non-pandemic winter mortality excesses as inevitable. We obtained weekly series for 35 industrialized countries from the Human Mortality Database for 2000–2020. Observed, baseline and excess mortalities were measured by age-standardized death rates. We assessed weekly and annual excess death rates driven by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and those related to seasonal respiratory infections in earlier years. There was a distinct geographic pattern with high excess death rates in Eastern Europe followed by parts of the UK, and countries of Southern and Western Europe. Some Asia-Pacific and Scandinavian countries experienced lower excess mortality. In 2020 and earlier years, the alternative retrospective and the within-year excess mortality figures were higher than estimates based on conventional metrics. While the latter were typically negative or close to zero in years without extraordinary epidemics, the alternative estimates were substantial. Cumulation of this "usual" excess over 2–3 years results in human losses comparable to those caused by COVID-19. Challenging the view that non-pandemic seasonal winter mortality is inevitable would focus attention on reducing premature mortality in many countries. As SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be the last respiratory pathogen with the potential to cause a pandemic, such measures would also strengthen global resilience in the face of similar threats in the future.

AB  - Background
It has been claimed that COVID-19 vaccination is associated with excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic, a claim that contributes to vaccine hesitancy. We examined whether all-cause mortality has actually increased in Cyprus during the first two pandemic years, and whether any increases are associated with vaccination rates.
Methods
We calculated weekly excess mortality for Cyprus between January 2020 and June 2022, overall and by age group, using both a Distributed Lag Nonlinear Model (DLNM) adjusted for mean daily temperature, and the EuroMOMO algorithm. Excess deaths were regressed on the weekly number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths and on weekly first-dose vaccinations, also using a DLNM to explore the lag-response dimension.
Results
552 excess deaths were observed in Cyprus during the study period (95% CI: 508–597) as opposed to 1306 confirmed COVID-19 deaths. No association between excess deaths and vaccination rates was found overall and for any age group except 18–49 years, among whom 1.09 excess deaths (95% CI: 0.27–1.91) per 10,000 vaccinations were estimated during the first 8 weeks post-vaccination. However, detailed cause-of-death examination identified just two such deaths potentially linked to vaccination, therefore this association is spurious and attributable to random error.
Conclusions
Excess mortality was moderately increased in Cyprus during the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily as a result of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths. No relationship was found between vaccination rates and all-cause mortality, demonstrating the excellent safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines.

This case study urges us to make value judgments in health-oriented models explicit and interpretable by non-experts and to invite public involvement in making them.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, the news of clinical trials for vaccines and mass vaccinations have brought renewed optimism for stabilizing the economy and financial markets. However, the mental stress of investors or doubt about the effectiveness of government policies to cope with economic disruptions has caused stock market volatility. We investigate the significance of the vaccination rate in alleviating the global stock market volatility which is measured by the GJR–GARCH model. We discover that a higher vaccine initiation rate has a positive effect on global stock markets, especially in developed countries and areas with higher rates than their average. Our findings remain reliable even when using different projected volatility models and other estimates of the main independent variables. Mass immunization also implies that governments will not have to take extreme measures to handle the pandemic, which alleviates investor worries about compliance and the prolonged effects of COVID-19. Our research indicates that global stock markets are providing insight into the economic value of the development of COVID-19 vaccines, even before public vaccinations start.

AB  - Several vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are expected to be available in Australia in 2021. Initial supply is limited and will require a judicious vaccination strategy until supply is unrestricted. If vaccines have efficacy as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in contacts, this provides more policy options. We used a deterministic mathematical model of epidemic response with limited supply (age-targeted or ring vaccination) and mass vaccination for the State of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia. For targeted vaccination, the effectiveness of vaccinating health workers, young people and older adults was compared. For mass vaccination, we tested varying vaccine efficacy (VE) and distribution capacities. With a limited vaccine stockpile enough for 1 million people in NSW, if there is efficacy as PEP, the most efficient way to control COVID-19 will be ring vaccination, however at least 90% of contacts per case needs to be traced and vaccinated. Health worker vaccination is required for health system resilience. Age based strategies with restricted doses make minimal impact on the epidemic, but vaccinating older people prevents more deaths. Herd immunity can only be achieved with mass vaccination. With 90% VE against all infection, herd immunity can be achieved by vaccinating 66% of the population. A vaccine with less than 70% VE cannot achieve herd immunity and will result in ongoing risk of outbreaks. For mass vaccination, distributing at least 60,000 doses per day is required to achieve control. Slower rates of vaccination will result in the population living with COVID-19 longer, and higher cases and deaths.

AB  - Summary
Background
Prior to the availability of vaccines, the risk factors for developing severe forms of COVID-19 were mostly older age and various comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, mental disorders, transplantations, and kidney disease. Although vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing severe forms of COVID-19, a residual risk may persist, despite vaccination, for certain population groups.
Methods
The study was based on data from the national COVID-19 vaccination database (VAC-SI) coupled with the National Health Data System (SNDS), which contains comprehensive reimbursement and hospitalisation data for all of France. All people fully vaccinated by July 31, 2021, with a double-injection vaccine, i.e., the mRNA BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines, or a single dose for people with a previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included and followed until August 31, 2021. Cox proportional hazard models were performed to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for COVID-19-related hospitalisation or in-hospital death associated with age, gender, deprivation index, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive or oral corticosteroid therapy from day 14 after full-vaccination.
Findings
In a population of 28,031,641 fully vaccinated individuals with an average follow-up of 80 days, 5,345 (87 hospitalisations per 100,000 person-years) were hospitalised for COVID-19 and 996 (16 in-hospital death per 100,000 person-years) died in hospital. In multivariable analysis, a higher risk was observed with increasing age, male gender, and social deprivation. Most of the 47 chronic conditions considered were positively associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation and a slight excess risk of death. The risk of hospitalisation and in-hospital death for COVID-19 also increased with the use of immunosuppressants (aHR 3.3 [2.8-3.8] and 2.4 [1.7-3.5], respectively) and oral corticosteroids (aHR 2.8 [2.5-3.1] and 4.1 [3.3-5.1]). Less than 10% (519/5,345) of hospitalised cases and 2% (24/996) of those who died in hospital had no identified comorbidities. There was a strong association between an increasing number of comorbidities and the risk of hospitalisation and in-hospital death (e.g., 5+ versus none, aHR 10.1 95%CI 9.0-11.5 and 17.8 95%CI 11.5-27.4, respectively).
Interpretation
Although vaccination has dramatically reduced the occurrence of severe forms of COVID-19, a residual risk remains for the elderly, immunocompromised, and polypathological populations and warrants complementary preventive measures.
Funding
None.

AB  - Introduction
Cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis have been reported in individuals vaccinated against COVID-19 with non-replicating adenoviral vector vaccines. We issue our recommendations on the diagnosis and management of patients presenting this complication.
Methods
The multidisciplinary working group, led by the Spanish Federation of Medical and Scientific Associations (FACME) and including representatives of several scientific societies, reviewed the available evidence from the literature and reports of the European Medicines Agency. We establish a definition for suspected cases and issue diagnostic and treatment recommendations regarding vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia.
Results
We define suspected cases as those cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis occurring between 3 and 21 days after the administration of non-replicating adenoviral vector vaccines, in patients with a platelet count below 150 000/μL or presenting a decrease of 50% with respect to the previous value. Findings suggestive of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopaenia include the presence of antibodies to platelet factor 4, D-dimer levels 4 times greater than the upper limit of normal, and unexplained thrombosis. The recommended treatment includes intravenous administration of non-specific human immunoglobulin or alternatively plasmapheresis, avoiding the use of heparin, instead employing argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, or apixaban for anticoagulation, and avoiding platelet transfusion.
Conclusions
Non-replicating adenoviral vector vaccines may be associated with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopaenia; it is important to treat the dysimmune phenomenon and the cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.
Resumen
Introducción
Se han reportado casos de trombosis venosas cerebral en personas vacunadas frente a COVID-19 con vacunas vectoriazadas con adenovirus no replicantes. Aportamos recomendaciones sobre el diagnóstico y manejo de pacientes con esta complicación.
Método
El Grupo de Trabajo multidisciplinar, liderado por la Federación de Asociaciones Científico Médicas Españolas (FACME) y representado por distintas sociedades científicas, revisó la evidencia disponible publicada en la literatura y en los informes de la Agencia Europea del Medicamento. Se estableció una definición de caso sospechoso y recomendaciones diagnóstico-terapéuticas de la trombocitopenia trombótica inducida por la vacunación.
Resultados
Se considera caso sospechoso aquella trombosis venosa cerebral ocurridas entre 3 y 21 días tras la administración de vacunas no replicantes de adenovirus que presenten un valor de plaquetas inferior a 150.000 plaquetas por μL o un descenso del 50% respecto de la cifra previa. Los datos sugestivos de trombocitopenia trombótica inducida por la vacunación incluyen la presencia de anticuerpos anti-factor plaquetario tipo 4, la elevación de dímero-D cuatro veces por encima del límite superior de la normalidad o la ausencia de justificación de la trombosis. En su tratamiento, se recomienda administrar inmunoglobulina humana inespecífica intravenosa o realizar plasmaféresis en su defecto, evitar el uso de heparina, empleando como anticoagulantes argatroban, bivalirudina, fondaparinux, rivaroxaban o apixaban, y evitar la transfusión de plaquetas.
Conclusiones
Las vacunas de vectores no replicantes de adenovirus pueden asociarse a trombosis venosas cerebrales con trombocitopenia, en cuyo manejo es importante el tratamiento del fenómeno disinmune y de la trombosis venosa cerebral.

AB  - Purpose
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries have scrambled to set up data collection and dissemination pipelines for various online datasets. This study aims to evaluate the reliability of the preliminary COVID-19 mortality data from Serbia, which has been included in major COVID-19 databases and utilized for research purposes worldwide.
Methods
Discrepancies between the preliminary mortality data and the final mortality data in Serbia were analyzed. The preliminary data were reported through an emergency-necessitated system, while the final data were generated by the regular vital statistics pipeline. We identified databases that include these data and conducted a literature review of articles that utilized them.
Results
The number of deaths due to COVID-19 in Serbia, as reported preliminarily, does not align with the final death toll, which is more than three times higher. Our literature review identified at least 86 studies that were impacted by these problematic data.
Conclusions
We strongly advise researchers to disregard the preliminary COVID-19 mortality data from Serbia due to the significant discrepancies with the final data. We recommend validating any preliminary data using excess mortality if all-cause mortality data are available.

AB  - The vigorous spread of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in the rapid infection of millions of people worldwide and devastation of not only public healthcare, but also social, educational, and economic infrastructures. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over time is due to the mutations that occurred in the genome during each replication. These mutated forms of SARS-CoV-2, otherwise known as variants, were categorized as variants of interest (VOI) or variants of concern (VOC) based on the increased risk of transmissibility, disease severity, immune escape, decreased effectiveness of current social measures, and available vaccines and therapeutics. The swift development of COVID-19 vaccines has been a great success for biomedical research, and billions of vaccine doses, including boosters, have been administered worldwide. BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer–BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) are the four major COVID-19 vaccines that received early regulatory authorization based on their efficacy. However, some SARS-CoV-2 variants resulted in higher resistance to available vaccines or treatments. It has been four years since the first reported infection of SARS-CoV-2, yet the Omicron variant and its subvariants are still infecting people worldwide. Despite this, COVID-19 vaccines are still expected to be effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death from COVID. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 pandemic focused on evolution of VOC and vaccination strategies against them.

AB  - Introduction
The immunogenicity and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination varied by demographic, including solid organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy.
Aim
This purpose of this study is to assess seropositivity and seroconversion in solid-organ transplant recipients before and after third-dose COVID-19 vaccination.
Methods
This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis performed using PRISMA guidelines. To analyze clinical and cohort studies reporting immunologic response and seroconversion third-dose vaccination, a systematic search was performed using electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Directory of Open Access Journal (DOAJ), and Clinicaltrials.gov).
Result
There were 18 full-text papers that could be analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. After the third vaccination, the pooled rate seropositivity was 67.00% (95% CI 59.511; 74.047, I2 = 93.82%), and the pooled rate seroconversion was 52.51% (95% CI 44.03; 60.91, I2 = 92.15%). The pooled rate of seroconversion after the mRNA-based booster was 52.380% (95% CI 40.988; 63.649, I2 = 94.35%), and after the viral-vector-based booster was 42.478% (95% CI 35.222; 49.900, I2 = 0.00%).
Conclusion
Based on the analysis of immunologic responses and seroconversion findings, the third-dose vaccination of solid organ transplant recipients is an effective method in establishing better immunity against COVID-19.

AB  - Background
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has disproportionately impacted communities deemed vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Our objectives were to test (1) whether infection and mortality decreased in counties in the most vulnerable (highest) tercile of the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), and (2) whether disparities between terciles of SVI were reduced, as the length of mask mandates increased.
Methods
Using the New York Times COVID-19 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention SVI and mask mandate datasets, we conducted negative binomial regression analyses of county-level COVID-19 cases and deaths from 1/2020–11/2021 on interactions of SVI and mask mandate durations.
Results
Mask mandates were associated with decreases in mid-SVI cases (IRR: 0.79) and deaths (IRR: 0.90) and high-SVI cases (IRR: 0.89) and deaths (IRR: 0.88). Mandates were associated with the mitigation of infection disparities (Change in IRR: 0.92) and mortality disparities (Change in IRR: 0.85) between low and mid-SVI counties and mortality disparities between low and high-SVI counties (Change in IRR: 0.84).
Discussion
Mask mandates were associated with reductions in COVID-19 infection and mortality and mitigation of disparities for mid and high-vulnerability communities.
Conclusions
Ongoing COVID-19 response efforts may benefit from longer-standing infection control policies, particularly in the most vulnerable communities.

AB  - Background
COVID‐19 vaccination has been associated with increased venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk. However, it is unknown whether genetic predisposition to VTE is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis following vaccination.
Methods
Using data from the UK Biobank, which contains in‐depth genotyping and linked vaccination and health outcomes information, we generated a polygenic risk score (PRS) using 299 genetic variants. We prospectively assessed associations between PRS and incident VTE immediately after first‐ and the second‐dose vaccination and among historical unvaccinated cohorts during the pre‐ and early pandemic. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) for PRS‐VTE associations using Cox models.
Results
Of 359 310 individuals receiving one dose of a COVID‐19 vaccine, 160 327 (44.6%) were males, and the mean age at the vaccination date was 69.05 (standard deviation [SD] 8.04) years. After 28‐ and 90‐days’ follow‐up, 88 and 299 individuals developed VTE, respectively, equivalent to an incidence rate of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70–1.08) and 0.92 (0.82–1.04) per 100 000 person‐days. The PRS was significantly associated with a higher risk of VTE (HR per 1 SD increase in PRS, 1.41 (1.15–1.73) in 28 days and 1.36 (1.22–1.52) in 90 days). Similar associations were found in the historical unvaccinated cohorts.
Conclusions
The strength of genetic susceptibility with post‐COVID‐19‐vaccination VTE is similar to that seen in historical data. Additionally, the observed PRS‐VTE associations were equivalent for adenovirus‐ and mRNA‐based vaccines. These findings suggest that, at the population level, the VTE that occurred after the COVID‐19 vaccination has a similar genetic etiology to the conventional VTE.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Objectives
Estimates for COVID-19-related excess mortality for African populations using local data are needed to design and implement effective control policies.
Methods
We applied time-series analysis using data from three health and demographic surveillance systems in The Gambia (Basse, Farafenni, and Keneba) to examine pandemic-related excess mortality during 2020, when the first SARS-CoV-2 wave was observed, compared to the pre-pandemic period (2016-2019).
Results
Across the three sites, average mortality during the pre-pandemic period and the total deaths during 2020 were 1512 and 1634, respectively (Basse: 1099 vs 1179, Farafenni: 316 vs 351, Keneba: 98 vs 104). The overall annual crude mortality rates per 100,000 (95% CI) were 589 (559, 619) and 599 (571, 629) for the pre-pandemic and 2020 periods, respectively. The adjusted excess mortality rate was 8.8 (-34.3, 67.6) per 100,000 person-month with the adjusted rate ratio (aRR) = 1.01 (0.94,1.11). The age-stratified analysis showed excess mortality in Basse for infants (aRR = 1.22 [1.04, 1.46]) and in Farafenni for the 65+ years age group (aRR = 1.19 [1, 1.44]).
Conclusion
We did not find significant excess overall mortality in 2020 in The Gambia. However, some age groups may have been at risk of excess death. Public health response in countries with weak health systems needs to consider vulnerable age groups and the potential for collateral damage.

AB  - Objectives
Some state veterans homes (SVHs) received media attention in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic because of allegations of poor infection control and excess mortality. However, little research has investigated how these facilities differ from community nursing homes (CNHs) and what the geographical trends of these infection and mortality differences are. We aimed to test (1) whether infection was overall lower in SVHs than CNHs, (2) whether mortality was overall lower in SVHs than CNHs, as well as the geographic distribution of nursing home infection and mortality across the United States.
Design
Retrospective nationwide cohort study.
Setting and Participants
Skilled nursing facilities in the United States from May 2020 to July 2022 during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
Using multilevel negative binomial regression, we modeled COVID-19 infection and mortality rates in skilled nursing homes, testing for overall SVH differences from May 2020 to July 2022, placing random effects on counties to calculate adjusted county-level infection and mortality rates.
Results
SVHs experienced 18% fewer cases but 25% more deaths overall compared with CNHs. Counties with the highest levels of facility infection, including counties with SVHs, were situated mainly in Midwestern, Atlantic, and Southern states, with the majority of counties with low infection levels in Central and Western states. Counties with the highest levels of facility mortality emerged in Rust Belt and Midwestern states down to Southern states, with the lowest levels of county-level mortality, particularly among counties containing SVHs, occurring westward to Central and Western states.
Conclusion and Implications
SVHs experienced lower infection levels but higher mortality levels than CNHs, and fewer extremely high infection and mortality rates in counties containing SVHs despite higher mortality risk in SVHs, calling attention to unobserved facility-level differences such as gender and age distributions and future research opportunities using more granular geographical aggregations to better understand facility-level SVH risk within the broader neighborhood context.

AB  - Summary
Background
Mortality statistics are fundamental to public health decision making. Mortality varies by time and location, and its measurement is affected by well known biases that have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aims to estimate excess mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic in 191 countries and territories, and 252 subnational units for selected countries, from Jan 1, 2020, to Dec 31, 2021.
Methods
All-cause mortality reports were collected for 74 countries and territories and 266 subnational locations (including 31 locations in low-income and middle-income countries) that had reported either weekly or monthly deaths from all causes during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, and for up to 11 year previously. In addition, we obtained excess mortality data for 12 states in India. Excess mortality over time was calculated as observed mortality, after excluding data from periods affected by late registration and anomalies such as heat waves, minus expected mortality. Six models were used to estimate expected mortality; final estimates of expected mortality were based on an ensemble of these models. Ensemble weights were based on root mean squared errors derived from an out-of-sample predictive validity test. As mortality records are incomplete worldwide, we built a statistical model that predicted the excess mortality rate for locations and periods where all-cause mortality data were not available. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression as a variable selection mechanism and selected 15 covariates, including both covariates pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as seroprevalence, and to background population health metrics, such as the Healthcare Access and Quality Index, with direction of effects on excess mortality concordant with a meta-analysis by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With the selected best model, we ran a prediction process using 100 draws for each covariate and 100 draws of estimated coefficients and residuals, estimated from the regressions run at the draw level using draw-level input data on both excess mortality and covariates. Mean values and 95% uncertainty intervals were then generated at national, regional, and global levels. Out-of-sample predictive validity testing was done on the basis of our final model specification.
Findings
Although reported COVID-19 deaths between Jan 1, 2020, and Dec 31, 2021, totalled 5·94 million worldwide, we estimate that 18·2 million (95% uncertainty interval 17·1–19·6) people died worldwide because of the COVID-19 pandemic (as measured by excess mortality) over that period. The global all-age rate of excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic was 120·3 deaths (113·1–129·3) per 100 000 of the population, and excess mortality rate exceeded 300 deaths per 100 000 of the population in 21 countries. The number of excess deaths due to COVID-19 was largest in the regions of south Asia, north Africa and the Middle East, and eastern Europe. At the country level, the highest numbers of cumulative excess deaths due to COVID-19 were estimated in India (4·07 million [3·71–4·36]), the USA (1·13 million [1·08–1·18]), Russia (1·07 million [1·06–1·08]), Mexico (798 000 [741 000–867 000]), Brazil (792 000 [730 000–847 000]), Indonesia (736 000 [594 000–955 000]), and Pakistan (664 000 [498 000–847 000]). Among these countries, the excess mortality rate was highest in Russia (374·6 deaths [369·7–378·4] per 100 000) and Mexico (325·1 [301·6–353·3] per 100 000), and was similar in Brazil (186·9 [172·2–199·8] per 100 000) and the USA (179·3 [170·7–187·5] per 100 000).
Interpretation
The full impact of the pandemic has been much greater than what is indicated by reported deaths due to COVID-19 alone. Strengthening death registration systems around the world, long understood to be crucial to global public health strategy, is necessary for improved monitoring of this pandemic and future pandemics. In addition, further research is warranted to help distinguish the proportion of excess mortality that was directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and the changes in causes of death as an indirect consequence of the pandemic.

AB  - In order to reduce the burden on healthcare systems and to support differential diagnosis with COVID-19, influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations were strongly recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in vulnerable groups. However, no univocal and conclusive evidence on the relationship between influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations and COVID‐19 outcomes exists. We evaluated the association between such vaccinations, COVID-19 hospitalization, intensive care unit admissions and deaths in a cohort (N = 741) of COVID-19 patients who had access to the emergency room of a large Italian University hospital between March 1, 2020 and June 1, 2020. Results show that influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations did not affect hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and deaths in COVID-19 patients in the overall sample and in those ≥65 years. The same pattern of results was confirmed considering timing of influenza vaccine administration, vaccination type, and number of uptakes in the last five vaccination campaigns. In conclusion, our study does not support an impact of influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations on COVID-19 outcomes.

AB  - Quantifying and analyzing excess mortality in crises such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is crucial for policymakers. Traditional measures fail to take into account differences in the level, long-term secular trends, and seasonal patterns in all-cause mortality across countries and regions. This paper develops and empirically investigates the forecasting performance of a novel, flexible and dynamic ensemble learning with a model selection strategy (DELMS) for the seasonal time series forecasting of monthly respiratory disease death data across a pool of 61 heterogeneous countries. The strategy is based on a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) of heterogeneous time series methods involving both the selection of the subset of best forecasters (model confidence set), the identification of the best holdout period for each contributed model, and the determination of optimal weights using out-of-sample predictive accuracy. A model selection strategy is also developed to remove the outlier models and to combine the models with reasonable accuracy in the ensemble. The empirical outcomes of this large set of experiments show that the accuracy of the BMA approach is significantly improved with DELMS when selecting a flexible and dynamic holdout period and removing the outlier models. Additionally, the forecasts of respiratory disease deaths for each country are highly accurate and exhibit a high correlation (94%) with COVID-19 deaths in 2020.

AB  - Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with excess risk of cardiovascular and thrombotic events in the early post-infection period and during convalescence. Despite the progress in our understanding of cardiovascular complications, uncertainty persists with respect to more recent event rates, temporal trends, association between vaccination status and outcomes, and findings within vulnerable subgroups such as older adults (aged 65 years or older), or those undergoing hemodialysis. Sex-informed findings, including results among pregnant and breastfeeding women, as well as adjusted comparisons between male and female adults are similarly understudied.
Methods
Adult patients, aged ≥18 years, with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 who received inpatient or outpatient care at the participating centers of the registry are eligible for inclusion. A total of 10,000 patients have been included in this multicenter study, with Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, MA) serving as the coordinating center. Other sites include Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Anne Arundel Medical Center, University of Virginia Medical Center, University of Colorado Health System, and Thomas Jefferson University Health System. Data elements will be ascertained manually for accuracy. The two main outcomes are 1) a composite of venous or arterial thrombotic events, and 2) a composite of major cardiovascular events, defined as venous or arterial thrombosis, myocarditis or heart failure with inpatient treatment, new atrial fibrillation/flutter, or cardiovascular death. Clinical outcomes are adjudicated by independent physicians. Vaccination status and time of inclusion in the study will be ascertained for subgroup-specific analyses. Outcomes are pre-specified to be reported separately for hospitalized patients versus those who were initially receiving outpatient care. Outcomes will be reported at 30-day and 90-day follow-up. Data cleaning at the sites and the data coordinating center and outcomes adjudication process are in-progress.
Conclusions
The CORONA-VTE-Network study will share contemporary information related to rates of cardiovascular and thrombotic events in patients with COVID-19 overall, as well as within key subgroups, including by time of inclusion, vaccination status, patients undergoing hemodialysis, the elderly, and sex-informed analyses such as comparison of women and men, or among pregnant and breastfeeding women.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Objectives
The global reported cumulative case–fatality ratios (rCFRs) and excess mortality rates of the 20 countries with the highest coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination rates, the rest of the world and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) were compared before and after the commencement of vaccination programmes.
Methods
A time series model was used to understand the trend of rCFR over time, and a generalized linear mixed model was used to understand the effect of vaccination on rCFR.
Results
By 31 December 2022, an average of 260.3 doses of COVID-19 vaccine per 100 population had been administered in the top 20 vaccinated countries, compared with 152.1 doses in the rest of the world and 51.2 doses in SSA. The mean rCFR of COVID-19 had decreased by 69.0% in the top 20 vaccinated countries, 26.5% in the rest of the world and 7.6% in SSA. Excess mortality had decreased by 48.7% in the top 20 vaccinated countries, compared with 62.5% in the rest of the world and 60.7% in SSA. In a generalized linear mixed model, the reported number of vaccine doses administered (/100 population) (odds ratio 0.64) was associated with a steeper reduction in COVID-19 rCFR.
Conclusions
Vaccine equity and faster roll-out across the world is critically important in reducing COVID-19 transmission and CFR.

AB  - Objective
To compare the mortality rates from COVID-19 among indigenous populations of the Amazon and Andean regions of Peru during the years 2020, 2021 and 2022.
Methods
Secondary analysis of 33,567 data from the COVID-19 Notification System of the National Epidemiology Center, Prevention and Control of Diseases (CDC-Peru), from the years 2020–2022. The variables were age, sex, belonging to the Andean or Amazonian ethnic group, number and type of symptoms and risk conditions, abnormal findings in chest X-rays, year of data collection for hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Poisson family generalized linear regression models with logarithmic linkage and robust variance were used to establish differences in mortality between ethnic groups. Crude and adjusted risk ratio (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
Results
33,567 participants with an average age of 33.6 years were included, 44.4 % were men and 70.2 % belonged to the Amazonian ethnic group. Most of those affected by COVID-19 presented 2 symptoms (38.8 %), 4.8 % presented some risk condition, 1451 (4.3 %) were hospitalized, and 433 (1.3 %) died. The adjusted analysis showed that the Andean group, compared to the Amazonian, tended to have a higher probability of death, and this association was statistically significant, RR =7.6, 95 % CI (5.5–10.5).
Conclusions
Patients from Andean indigenous communities had an almost 8 times higher risk of death from COVID-19.

AB  - Objective
To investigate the association between Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and COVID-19 vaccination.
Background
On July 13, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a new warning that Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine could increase the risk of developing GBS.
Methods
The reporting rate of adult GBS after COVID-19 vaccination, ascertained with Brighton criteria, was compared with the reporting rate after other vaccinations during the same time period, and also compared with the reporting rate during control periods. Statistical methods such as proportion tests, and Pearson’s chi-squared test were utilized to identify significant relationships. Self-controlled and case centered analyses were conducted. A machine learning model was utilized to identify the factors associated with a worse outcome defined as emergency room (ER) or doctor visits, hospitalizations, and deaths.
Results
The reporting rate of GBS after COVID-19 vaccination was significantly higher than after influenza and other vaccinations (49.7, 0.19, 0.16 per 10 million, p < 0.0001). However, the reporting rate was within the incidence range of GBS in the general population. Using self-controlled and case centered analyses, there was a significant difference in the reporting rate of GBS after COVID-19 vaccination between the risk period and control period (p < 0.0001). There was an estimated 0.7–1.7 per million excess reports of GBS within 6 weeks of COVID-19 vaccination. Machine learning model demonstrated that female gender and age between 18 and 44 are associated with worse outcome. No association was found between the onset interval of GBS and its prognosis.
Conclusions
Although the reporting rate of GBS after COVID-19 vaccination was not statistically different than that of the general population, the increased reporting of GBS within the first 6 weeks after COVID-19 vaccination, more so than with other vaccinations, suggests that some cases of GBS are temporally associated with COVID-19 vaccination. However, there is a reduction in the reporting rate of GBS after other vaccines, compared to reporting rates pre-COVID-19, highlighting limitations inherent in any passive surveillance system. These findings warrant continuous analysis of GBS after COVID-19 vaccination. Further improvement of the machine learning model is needed for clinical use.

AB  - Introduction
Vaccination represents an important strategy to mitigate COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality by protecting against severe forms of the disease and reducing hospitalization and death rates. In this sense, the objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of Vaccination Intention (VI) against COVID-19 in Latin America and Caribbean (LAC).
Methods
We conducted a systematic review with a comprehensive search strategy for the following databases: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. A random-effect model meta-analysis was carried out using observational studies assessing the intention to vaccines against COVID-19 in LAC countries. The Clopper-Pearson method was used to estimate 95% Confidence Intervals. The quality assessment was developed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale adapted for cross-sectional studies. A subgroup analysis by study location and a sensitivity analysis were developed.
Results
Nineteen cross-sectional studies were included. Five meta-analyzes were performed according to the target population of the included studies. The VI in the general population of LAC was 78.0% (95%CI: 74.0%–82.0%). The VI for non-pregnant women was 78.0% (95%CI: 58.0%–99.0%), for elderly population was 63.0% (95%CI: 59.0%–69.0%), for pregnant women was 69.0% (95%CI: 61.0%–76.0%) and for health-personnel was 83.0% (95% CI: 71.0%–96.0%). The sensitivity analysis for general population meta-analysis that included only low risk of bias studies showed a 77.0% VI (95%CI: 73.0%–82.0%) and for non-pregnant women, 85.0% VI (95%CI: 79.0%–90.0%).
Conclusion
Despite the high prevalence of VI in general population found in our study, VI prevalence from elderly people and pregnant women are lower than other population groups and overall population.

AB  - Objectives
This nationwide, multicentric, retrospective analysis of 1,126,946 COVID-19 cases (March 2020 to June 2022) aims to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on mortality in patients with a sole solid malignancy.
Methods
Using data from the national digital medical record repository, outcomes were compared among fully vaccinated and non-vaccinated cohorts, factoring in gender, virus type, age, vaccination status, vaccine type, and cancer type. Logistic regression calculated odds ratios and their significance.
Results
Among 6,050 patients with both cancer and comorbidities, 1,797 had only solid malignancy. Vaccinated individuals in this group had reduced mortality rates, especially those >63 years [OR 0.169 (95%CI 0.090 to 0.317); P < 0.001]. Lower deaths were observed in non-ICU [OR 0.193 (95% CI 0.097 to 0.382); P < 0.001] and ICU cases [OR 0.224 (95% CI 0.077 to 0.646); P = 0.003], with both vaccine types. No statistically significant benefits were observed against delta and omicron variants. Intrathoracic malignancies [OR 0.376 (95%CI 0.146 to 0.971); P = 0.043] and palliative treatment [OR 0.384 (95%CI 0.192 to 0.766); P = 0.006] showed vaccination benefits. Logistic regression revealed a higher fatal risk in non-vaccinated males >63. Propensity score matching supported these outcomes.
Conclusion
Patients with sole solid malignancies face elevated COVID-19 mortality risk, particularly without active cytostatic therapy, with advanced disease on palliative treatment, or intrathoracic malignancies.

AB  - Background
HF can be encountered at different stages in the course of COVID-19 disease. However, data regarding the HF-related mortality during COVID-19 pandemic are scant
Objective
We investigate the heart failure (HF)-related mortality rate in the US among patient with or without COVID-19 infection during the first two pandemic waves in 2020 and to compare them to those of previous years (2014–2019).
Methods
Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) per 100.000 person-years, with relative 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined using the free-available dataset for Multiple cause-of-death, provided by the Center for Disease Control.
Results
Throughout the 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, 522.848 HF-related deaths were registered (461.594 and 61.254 in subjects without and with COVID-19 infection, respectively). The overall HF-related AAMR was 124.6 (65% CI 123.4–125.6), reflecting an increased HF-related mortality of 13.2% and 25.9% compared to 2019 and 2018 (p < 0.0001). HF-related AAMR was 111.0 (95% CI: 110.7–111.4) and 14.8 (95% CI: 14.6–14.9) per 100.000 population for decedents without and with COVID-19 disease, respectively. The proportionate mortality of HF in COVID-19 patients was 11.7%. HF-related AAMR in COVID-19 patients was higher in men (18.0 per 100.000, 95% CI: 17.8–18.2), in patients aged more 65 years (104.0 per 100.000, 95% CI: 103.1–104.9), in African Americans (22.5 per 100.000, 95% CI: 22.0–22.3) and in those living in rural counties (18.4 per 100.000, 95% CI: 18.0–18.7).
Conclusions
A significant increase in the HF-related mortality during the 2020 was observed synchronously with the COVID-19 pandemic

AB  - Objectives
The COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by successive waves that each developed differently over time and through space. We aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the evolution of COVID-19 mortality during 2020 and 2021 in a selection of countries.
Methods
We focus on five European countries and the United States. Using standardized and age-specific mortality rates, we address variations in COVID-19 mortality within and between countries, and demographic characteristics and seasonality patterns.
Results
Our results highlight periods of acceleration and deceleration in the pace of COVID-19 mortality, with substantial differences across countries. Periods of stabilization were identified during summer (especially in 2020) among the European countries analyzed but not in the United States. The latter stands out as the study population with the highest COVID-19 mortality at young ages. In general, COVID-19 mortality is highest at old ages, particularly during winter. Compared with women, men have higher COVID-19 mortality rates at most ages and in most seasons.
Conclusion
There is seasonality in COVID-19 mortality for both sexes at all ages, characterized by higher rates during winter. In 2021, the highest COVID-19 mortality rates continued to be observed at ages 75+, despite vaccinations having targeted those ages specifically.

AB  - The debate around vaccine prioritization for COVID-19 has revolved around balancing the benefits from: (1) the direct protection conferred by the vaccine amongst those at highest risk of severe disease outcomes, and (2) the indirect protection through vaccinating those that are at highest risk of being infected and of transmitting the virus. While adults aged 65+ are at highest risk for severe disease and death from COVID-19, essential service and other in-person workers with greater rates of contact may be at higher risk of acquiring and transmitting SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, there have been relatively little data available to understand heterogeneity in contact rates and risk across these demographic groups. Here, we retrospectively analyze and evaluate vaccination prioritization strategies by age and worker status. We use a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and uniquely detailed contact data collected as part of the Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Survey to evaluate five vaccination prioritization strategies: (1) prioritizing only adults over age 65, (2) prioritizing only high-contact workers, (3) splitting prioritization between adults 65+ and high-contact workers, (4) tiered prioritization of adults over age 65 followed by high-contact workers, and (5) tiered prioritization of high-contact workers followed by adults 65+. We find that for the primary two-dose vaccination schedule, assuming 70% uptake, a tiered roll-out that first prioritizes adults 65+ averts the most deaths (31% fewer deaths compared to a no-vaccination scenario) while a tiered roll-out that prioritizes high contact workers averts the most number of clinical infections (14% fewer clinical infections compared to a no-vaccination scenario). We also consider prioritization strategies for booster doses during a subsequent outbreak of a hypothetical new SARS-CoV-2 variant. We find that a tiered roll-out that prioritizes adults 65+ for booster doses consistently averts the most deaths, and it may also avert the most number of clinical cases depending on the epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 variant and the vaccine efficacy.

AB  - Summary
Background
On Dec 14, 2020, the United States initiated a nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Demonstrating clear population-level impact following vaccine introduction helps to further elucidate and quantify the public-health benefits of vaccination.
Methods
Using a negative binomial regression model we evaluated the ecological association between county-level COVID-19 vaccine uptake and rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States from April 1, 2021 through October 31, 2021 controlling for a broad set of county-level environmental, sociodemographic, economic, and health-status-related characteristics. County-level data were obtained from several publicly available databases that were merged for analysis.
Findings
After adjustment for county-level characteristics, US counties with ≥ 80% of their residents ≥ 12 years of age fully vaccinated against COVID-19 had 30% (95% CI: 25−35; P < .001) and 46% (38−52; P < .001) lower rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths, respectively, versus those with <50% coverage (reference group). A dose response was observed: counties with 70−79% uptake had 20% (95% CI: 16−24; P < .001) and 35% (29−40; P < .001) lower rates of cases and deaths, respectively; counties with 60−69% uptake had 8% (5−11; P < .001) and 20% (15−24; P < .001) lower rates; and counties with 50−59% uptake had 2% (0−4; P =.09) and 8% (4−12; P < .001) lower rates. Restricting the analysis to the period when the Delta variant was predominant (June 1, 2021 ‒ October 31, 2021) showed similar findings.
Interpretation
Our results showed that US counties with higher proportions of persons ≥ 12 years of age fully vaccinated against COVID-19 had substantially lower rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths—a finding that showed dose response and persisted even in the period when Delta was predominant.

AB  - Latino people in the US are experiencing higher excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic than any other racial/ethnic group, but it is unclear which sociodemographic subgroups within this diverse population are most affected. Such information is necessary to target policies that prevent further excess mortality and reduce inequities. Using death certificate data for January 1, 2016 through February 29, 2020 and time-series models, we estimated the expected weekly deaths among Latino people in California from March 1 through October 3, 2020. We quantified excess mortality as observed minus expected deaths and risk ratios (RR) as the ratio of observed to expected deaths. We considered subgroups categorized by age, sex, nativity, country of birth, educational attainment, occupation, and combinations of these factors. Our results indicate that during the first seven months of the pandemic, Latino deaths in California exceeded expected deaths by 10,316, a 31% increase. Excess death rates were greatest for individuals born in Mexico (RR 1.44; 95% PI, 1.41, 1.48) or a Central American country (RR 1.49; 95% PI, 1.37, 1.64), with less than a high school degree (RR 1.41; 95% PI, 1.35, 1.46), or in food-and-agriculture (RR 1.60; 95% PI, 1.48, 1.74) or manufacturing occupations (RR 1.59; 95% PI, 1.50, 1.69). Immigrant disadvantages in excess death were magnified among working-age Latinos in essential occupations. In sum, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted mortality among Latino immigrants, especially those in unprotected essential jobs. Interventions to reduce these inequities should include targeted vaccination, workplace safety enforcement, and expanded access to medical care and economic support.

AB  - Governments can underreport Covid-19 mortality to make their performance appear more successful than it is. Autocracies are more likely to ‘fudge’ these data since many autocratic regimes restrict media freedom and thus can prevent domestic media from reporting evidence of undercounting deaths. Autocracies also enjoy greater leverage over reporting health authorities to either fudge data or adopt restrictive definitions of what constitutes Covid-19 mortality. Controlling for other factors that explain official Covid-19 mortality, excess mortality and the difference between the two, our results suggest that any apparent ‘autocratic advantage’ in fighting the pandemic is likely to only exist in official Covid-19 mortality. Analyzing the gap between excess mortality and official Covid-19 mortality we find that autocracies on average have a larger gap between official Covid-19 mortality data and excess mortality data, which points towards ‘autocratic data fudging’ of their official Covid-19 mortality statistics.

AB  - Background
Norway and Sweden picked two different ways to mitigate the dissemination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Norway introduced the strictest lockdown in Europe with strict border controls and intense virus tracking of all local outbreaks while Sweden did not. That resulted in 477 COVID-19 deaths (Norway) and 9737 (Sweden) in 2020, respectively.
Methods
Weekly number of COVID-19 related deaths and total deaths for 2020-22 were collected as well as weekly number of deaths for 2015-19 which were used as controls when calculating excess mortality. During the first 12-18 months with high rate of virus transmission in the society, excess mortality rates were used as substitute for COVID-19 deaths. When excess mortality rates later turned negative because of mortality displacement, COVID-19 deaths adjusted for bias due to overreporting were used.
Results
There were 17521 COVID-19 deaths in Sweden and 4272 in Norway in the study period. The rate ratio (RR) of COVID-19 related deaths in Sweden vs. Norway to the end of week 43, 2022, was 2.11 (95% CI 2.05-2.19). RR of COVID-19 related deaths vs. excess number of deaths were 2.5 (Sweden) and 1.3 (Norway), respectively. RR of COVID-19 deaths in Sweden vs. Norway after adjusting for mortality displacement and lockdown, was 1.35 (95% CI 1.31-1.39), corresponding to saving 2025 life in Norway. If including all deaths in 2022, RR=1.28 (95% CI 1.24-1.31).
Conclusions
Both COVID-19 related mortality and excess mortality rates are biased estimates. When adjusting for bias, mortality differences declined over time to about 30% higher mortality in Sweden after 30 months with pandemics and at the cost of 12 million € per prevented death in Norway.

AB  - Background
The existing literature estimates a significantly reduced odds of hospitalisation and death among individuals. However, though less severe than other variants, the Omicron variant may still lead to excess mortality compared to pre-pandemic years.
Methods
A generalized linear mixed model is introduced to model weekly mortality from 2011 to 2019, taking into account seasonal patterns and year-specific trends. Based on the 2019 year-specific conditional best linear unbiased predictions, excess of mortality is estimated.
Results
In Italy, 14 and 11 regions suffered from relevant excess mortality in January and February, respectively. However, the situation is far from being as critical as during previous waves.
Conclusions
We can conclude that no matter which variant (or multiple inter-variant recombination) we are facing, excess mortality will appear in correspondence of any incidence peak.

AB  - This paper discusses the findings of an empirical analysis of the Kuznets, or reverse U-shaped relationship, between the COVID-19 mortality rate and economic performance. In the early stages of economic development, the COVID-19 mortality rate is anticipated to rise with rising economic activity and urbanization. Eventually, the mortality rate decreases at higher economic development levels as people and the government are more capable of investing in disease abatement measures. The quality of political institutions, wealth distribution, urbanization, vaccination rate, and improvements in healthcare systems are hypothesized to affect the COVID-19 mortality rate. Examining this relationship can be effective in understanding the change in the COVID-19 mortality rate at different economic performance stages and in identifying appropriate preventive measures. This study employed the negative binomial regression to model a cross-sectional dataset of 137 countries. Results indicated that the relationship between the per-head gross domestic product (GDP) level and the COVID-19 mortality rate appeared to follow a pattern like the Kuznets curve, implying that changes in institutional quality, healthcare advancements, wealth distribution, urbanization, vaccination rate, and the percentage of the elderly population were significant in explaining the relationship. Improvement of the healthcare system has a notable effect on lowering the COVID-19 mortality rate under more effective government conditions. Additionally, the results suggested that a higher per-head GDP is required to reverse the rising trend of the mortality rate under higher income inequality. Based on these results, preventive measures, and policies to reduce COVID-19 mortalities were recommended in the conclusion section.

AB  - Background and aims
Diabetes confers an excess risk of death to COVID-19 patients. Causes of death are now available for different phases of the pandemic, encompassing different viral variants and COVID-19 vaccination. The aims of the present study were to update multiple causes of death data on diabetes-related mortality during the pandemic and to estimate the impact of common diabetic comorbidities on excess mortality.
Methods and results
Diabetes-related deaths in 2020–2021 were compared with the 2018–2019 average; furthermore, age-standardized rates observed during the pandemic were compared with expected figures obtained from the 2008–2019 time series through generalized estimating equation models. Changes in diabetes mortality associated with specific comorbidities were also computed. Excess diabetes-related mortality was +26% in 2020 and +18% in 2021, after the initiation of the vaccination campaign. The presence of diabetes and hypertensive diseases was associated with the highest mortality increase, especially in subjects aged 40–79 years, +41% in 2020 and +30% in 2021.
Conclusion
The increase in diabetes-related deaths exceeded that observed for all-cause mortality, and the risk was higher when diabetes was associated with hypertensive diseases. Notably, the excess mortality decreased in 2021, after the implementation of vaccination against COVID-19.

AB  - Introduction
This study evaluated outcomes and risk factors for COVID-19 in 91 Brazilian multiple myeloma (MM) patients between April 2020 and January 2022.
Results
Of the 91 MM patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 64% had comorbidities and 66% required hospitalization due to COVID-19, with 44% needing ventilatory support and 37% intensive care. Age (OR 2.02; 95%CI 1.02 – 7.7) and hypertension OR 4.5; 95%CI 1.3 – 15.5) were independently associated with hospitalization and certain MM therapies (corticosteroids and monoclonal drugs) were associated with ventilatory support (OR 4.3; 95%CI 1.3 – 14 and OR 5.7; 95%CI 1.8 – 18, respectively), while corticosteroids and immunomodulatory drugs were linked to ICU admission (OR 5.1; 95% CI 1.4 – 18 and OR 3.4; 95%CI 1.1 – 10, respectively). The overall mortality rate was 30%, with the highest rate observed in the ICU (73%). Additionally, the ECOG performance status was linked to increased mortality (OR 11.5; 95%CI 1.9 – 69). The MM treatment was delayed in 63% of patients who recovered from COVID-19.
Conclusions
The findings highlight the need for preventing COVID-19 and prioritizing vaccination among MM patients, as they have high rates of severe outcomes in the event of COVID-19. It is also essential to monitor the potential clinical impacts of COVID-19 on MM patients in the long-term. Given the limited resources available in treating MM patients in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic, outcomes might be worse in this population.

This chapter is based on using mathematical modeling approaches to provide insight into the impact of these vaccines on mitigating the burden of COVID-19 in the United States. Using a basic compartmental vaccination model, which was fitted using daily COVID-19 mortality data for the United States, this study shows that vaccine-derived herd immunity can be achieved, using either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, if at least 78% of the populace is fully vaccinated. This herd immunity threshold level decreases if the vaccination program is combined with other NPIs, such as face masks. It is shown that although the use of low to moderately effective face masks as a sole intervention might not be sufficient to effectively contain or eliminate the COVID-19 pandemic even at near-perfect coverage, the use of highly efficacious masks (e.g., respirators) or the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines alone might be sufficient to lead to the elimination of the pandemic if the coverage is moderately high enough. It is shown that waning of immunity only offers marginal impact on the trajectory of the disease, and that the presence of a COVID-19 variant increases the value of vaccine coverage needed to achieve herd immunity. Finally, the prospects of the effective control of the pandemic are promising using the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines if the coverage level in their usage is high enough or if they are combined with other NPIs.

AB  - We evaluate quartile rankings of countries during the Covid-19 pandemic using both official (confirmed) and excess mortality data. By December 2021, the quartile rankings of three-fifths of the countries differ when ranked by excess vs. official mortality. Countries that are ‘doing substantially better’ in the excess mortality are characterized by higher urban population shares; higher GDP/Capita; and higher scores on institutional and policy variables. We perform two regressions in which the ratio of Cumulative Excess to Official Covid-19 mortalities (E/O ratio) is regressed on covariates. In a narrow study, controlling for GDP/Capita and vaccination rates, by December 2021 the E/O ratio was smaller in countries with higher vaccination rates. In a broad study, adding institutional and policy variables, the E/O ratio was smaller in countries with higher degree of voice and accountability. The arrival of vaccines in 2021 and voice and accountability had a discernible association on the E/O ratio.

AB  - Background
With the rapid rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, numerous associated and suspected adverse events have been reported nationally and worldwide. Literature reporting confirmed cases of pericarditis and myocarditis following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations has evolved, with a predominance in adolescent males following the second dose.
Methods
This was a retrospective analysis of all patients presenting to St Vincent’s Hospital, Sydney, Australia with suspected COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis. The Brighton Collaboration Case Definitions of Myocarditis and Pericarditis were used to categorise patients into groups based on diagnostic certainty. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings were reviewed against updated Lake Louise Criteria for diagnosing patients with suspected myocarditis.
Results
We report 10 cases of confirmed, possible or probable myocarditis and pericarditis. The mean age of presentation in the vaccine group was 33±9.0 years. The most common presenting symptom was pleuritic chest pain (n=8, 80%). Eight patients (80%) had electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (n=6 pericarditis, n=2 myocarditis). Five patients (50%) had a minimum 24 hours of cardiac monitoring. One patient had multisystem inflammatory syndrome following vaccination (MIS-V) with severely impaired left ventricular ejection fraction and required admission to the intensive care unit.
Discussion and Conclusion
Cardiac complications post mRNA vaccines are rare. Our case series reflects the worldwide data that vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis most frequently occur in young males, following the second dose of the vaccine. These cardiac side effects are mild and self-limiting, with adequate responses to oral anti-inflammatories. One patient developed a severe reaction, with no fatal cases.

AB  - Background/Objective
Adrenal crisis (AC) is an acute life-threatening condition that can occur in patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency who are already receiving glucocorticoid replacement therapy or can be a first presentation of adrenal insufficiency. Vaccination with tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, influenza, and pneumococcal vaccines has been reported as a cause of AC. Here, we aimed to present a case of AC precipitated by COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccination in a patient with hypopituitarism.
Case Report
A 74-year-old male patient with hypopituitarism received the second dose of the messenger RNA (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccine and after a few hours developed lethargy and confusion followed by fever. In the next day, the patient was more somnolent and unable to converse. His temperature and heart rate were 103.5 °F and 105 beats/min, respectively, and his blood pressure was 145/84 mm Hg, which decreased to 107/71 mm Hg. The patient was stuporous, responsive only to painful stimuli. A stress dose of glucocorticoids was started with improvement in all symptoms in 24 hours of treatment initiation.
Discussion
Vaccination with ChAdOx1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has been recognized as a cause of AC in patients with adrenal insufficiency. The present case report additionally demonstrates that different types of COVID-19 vaccines may be a cause of AC in patients with adrenal insufficiency.
Conclusion
A twofold to threefold increase in the maintenance dose of glucocorticoid is recommended if the patient is experiencing any symptom after COVID-19 vaccination. This treatment may reduce the risk of AC occurring after COVID-19 vaccination in patients with hypopituitarism.

KW  - Temporal pattern
AB  - Background
Although the COVID-19 pandemic has persisted for more than two years with the evident excess mortality from diabetes, few studies have investigated its temporal patterns. This study aims to estimate the excess deaths from diabetes in the United States (US) during the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate the excess deaths by spatiotemporal pattern, age groups, sex, and race/ethnicity.
Methods
Diabetes as one of multiple causes of death or an underlying cause of death were both considered into analyses. The Poisson log-linear regression model was used to estimate weekly expected counts of deaths during the pandemic with adjustments for long-term trend and seasonality. Excess deaths were measured by the difference between observed and expected death counts, including weekly average excess deaths, excess death rate, and excess risk. We calculated the excess estimates by pandemic wave, US state, and demographic characteristic.
Results
From March 2020 to March 2022, deaths that diabetes as one of multiple causes of death and an underlying cause of death were about 47.6 % and 18.4 % higher than the expected. The excess deaths of diabetes had evident temporal patterns with two large percentage increases observed during March 2020, to June 2020, and June 2021 to November 2021. The regional heterogeneity and underlying age and racial/ethnic disparities of the excess deaths were also clearly observed.
Conclusions
This study highlighted the increased risks of diabetes mortality, heterogeneous spatiotemporal patterns, and associated demographic disparities during the pandemic. Practical actions are warranted to monitor disease progression, and lessen health disparities in patients with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Objectives
This article describes the prevalence and epidemiological trends of COVID-19 mortality in the largest registry in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).
Study design
A prospective epidemiological cohort study using data from all healthcare facilities in KSA collected between March 23, 2020, and April 30, 2022. Data on the number of daily deaths directly related to COVID-19 were gathered, analyzed, and reported.
Method
Data analysis was carried out using national and regional crude case fatality rate and death per 100,000 population. Descriptive statistics using numbers and proportions were used to describe age, gender, nationality, and comorbidities. The mortality trend was plotted and compared with international figures. In addition, the most common comorbidities associated with mortality and the proportion of patients who received COVID-19 vaccine were reported.
Results
The total reported number of deaths between March 23, 2020, and April 30, 2022, was 9085. Crude case fatality rate was 1.21%, and death per 100,000 population was 25.38, which compared favorably to figures reported by several developed countries. The highest percentages of deaths were among individuals aged between 60 and 69 years, males (71%), and individuals with diabetes (60%). Only 2.8% of mortalities occur in patients who received COVID-19 vaccine. Diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure had the highest attributable risk of mortality among patients who died due to COVID-19.
Conclusion
Case fatality rate and death per 100,000 population in KSA are among the lowest in the world due to multiple factors. Several comorbidities have been identified, namely, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and cardiac arrhythmias.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. has been largely monitored using death certificates containing reference to COVID-19. However, prior analyses reveal that a significant percentage of excess deaths associated with the pandemic were not directly assigned to COVID-19. In this study, we estimated a generalized linear model of expected mortality based on historical trends in deaths by county of residence between 2011 and 2019. We used the results of the model to generate estimates of excess mortality and excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 in 2020 for 1470 county sets in the U.S. representing 3138 counties. Across the country, we estimated that 438,386 excess deaths occurred in 2020, among which 87.5% were assigned to COVID-19. Some regions (Mideast, Great Lakes, New England, and Far West) reported the most excess deaths in large central metros, whereas other regions (Southwest, Southeast, Plains, and Rocky Mountains) reported the highest excess mortality in nonmetro areas. The proportion assigned to COVID-19 was lowest in large central metro areas (79.3%). Regionally, the proportion of excess deaths assigned to COVID-19 was lowest in the Southeast (81.6%), Southwest (82.6%), Far West (83.7%), and Rocky Mountains (86.7%). Across the regions, the number of excess deaths exceeded the number of directly assigned COVID-19 deaths in most counties. The exception to this pattern occurred in New England, which reported more directly assigned COVID-19 deaths than excess deaths in metro and nonmetro areas. Many county sets had substantial numbers of excess deaths that were not accounted for in direct COVID-19 death counts. Estimates of excess mortality at the local level can inform the allocation of resources to areas most impacted by the pandemic and contribute to positive behavior feedback loops, such as increases in mask-wearing and vaccine uptake.

AB  - While vaccination is generally considered efficient in protecting against transmissible diseases, the compliance is not complete in many countries. In this study, we investigate how an individual-specific factor – family size – affects the probability of getting vaccinated against COVID-19. To answer this research question, we focus on individuals above 50 years of age, who are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. The analysis uses the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe Corona wave, conducted in the summer of 2021. To identify the effect of family size on vaccination, we exploit an exogenous variation in the probability of having more than two children, due to the sex composition of two firstborns. We document that a larger family size increases the probability of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine among older individuals. This impact is economically and statistically significant. We propose several potential mechanisms behind this result and document that family size can be related to the higher probability of being exposed to the disease. This effect can be by knowing someone who tested positive for COVID-19 or had symptoms similar to it, and by network size and frequency of contact with children, before the outbreak of COVID-19.

We aimed to determine the influence of vaccination and air temperature on COVID-19 transmission and severity.
Methods
The study data in 146 countries from January 6, 2020 to July 28, 2022 were aggregated into 19,856 weeks. Country-level weekly incidence, time-varying reproduction number (Rt), mortality, and infection–fatality ratio (IFR) were compared among groups of these weeks with different vaccination rates and air temperatures.
Results
Weeks with <15 °C air temperature and 60% vaccination showed the highest incidence (mean, 604; SD, 855; 95% CI, 553–656, unit, /100,000 persons; N = 1073) and the highest rate of weeks with >1 Rt (mean, 41.6%; SD, 1.49%; 95% CI, 39.2–45.2%; N = 1090), while weeks with >25 °C and <20% showed the lowest incidence (mean, 24; SD, 75; 95% CI, 22–26; N = 5805) and the lowest rate of weeks with >1 Rt (mean, 15.3%; SD, 0.461%; 95% CI, 14.2–16.2%; N = 6122). Mortality in weeks with <15 °C (mean, 2.1; SD, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.0–2.2, unit, /100,000 persons; N = 4365) was five times of the mortality in weeks with >25 °C (mean, 0.44; SD, 1; 95% CI, 0.41–0.46; N = 7741). IFR ranged between 2% and 2.6% (SD, 1.9%–2.4%; 95% CI, 2.0–2.7%) at < 20% vaccination level, 1.8% (SD, 2%–2.2%; 95% CI, 1.7–2.0%) at 20–60% vaccination level, and 0.7%–1% (SD, 1%–1.8%; 95% CI, 0.7–1.1%) at > 60% vaccination level and at all air temperatures (all P < 0.001).
Conclusions
Vaccination was insufficient to mitigate the transmission since the significantly elevated weekly incidence and >1 Rt rate in weeks with high vaccination, while IFR was reduced by high vaccination. Countries with long-term low air temperature were affected by high transmission and high mortality.

AB  - Objectives
We used publicly available population data from 1 January 2019 up to 31 December 2022, to investigate mortality trends in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic, evaluating changes in life expectancy (LE) at birth within provinces and the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations.
Study design
Aggregate data analysis.
Methods
Annual period life tables were used to estimate sex-specific LEs within provinces from 2019 to 2022. We used Arriaga decomposition to analyze the contribution of age groups (<60 years and ≥60 years) to annual LE changes. We implemented a Quasi-Poisson regression model to estimate the number of averted deaths by the achieved COVID-19 vaccination rates from January 2021 up to December 2022, simulating a counterfactual scenario where vaccine doses were not administered.
Results
The results revealed geographical heterogeneity in annual LE changes across Italian provinces during the pandemic. By the end of 2022, LE was below the prepandemic levels in 88% of provinces for females and in 76% for males. In addition, we estimated that the achieved vaccination rates averted 460,831 deaths (95% confidence interval: 250,976–707,920), corresponding to a 25% reduction in expected all-cause mortality.
Conclusions
Overall, the study highlighted the significant role of COVID-19 vaccinations in averting a considerable number of deaths and improving LE. However, by the end of 2022, LE had not fully recovered to prepandemic levels in many provinces. This could be attributed to concurrent factors, including enduring COVID-19 pandemic effects, intense summer heat waves and early onset of seasonal flu. Further research and continuous monitoring are essential to fully comprehend long-term mortality trends and optimize public health strategies.

AB  - Summary
Background
The first COVID-19 vaccine outside a clinical trial setting was administered on Dec 8, 2020. To ensure global vaccine equity, vaccine targets were set by the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility and WHO. However, due to vaccine shortfalls, these targets were not achieved by the end of 2021. We aimed to quantify the global impact of the first year of COVID-19 vaccination programmes.
Methods
A mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission and vaccination was separately fit to reported COVID-19 mortality and all-cause excess mortality in 185 countries and territories. The impact of COVID-19 vaccination programmes was determined by estimating the additional lives lost if no vaccines had been distributed. We also estimated the additional deaths that would have been averted had the vaccination coverage targets of 20% set by COVAX and 40% set by WHO been achieved by the end of 2021.
Findings
Based on official reported COVID-19 deaths, we estimated that vaccinations prevented 14·4 million (95% credible interval [Crl] 13·7–15·9) deaths from COVID-19 in 185 countries and territories between Dec 8, 2020, and Dec 8, 2021. This estimate rose to 19·8 million (95% Crl 19·1–20·4) deaths from COVID-19 averted when we used excess deaths as an estimate of the true extent of the pandemic, representing a global reduction of 63% in total deaths (19·8 million of 31·4 million) during the first year of COVID-19 vaccination. In COVAX Advance Market Commitment countries, we estimated that 41% of excess mortality (7·4 million [95% Crl 6·8–7·7] of 17·9 million deaths) was averted. In low-income countries, we estimated that an additional 45% (95% CrI 42–49) of deaths could have been averted had the 20% vaccination coverage target set by COVAX been met by each country, and that an additional 111% (105–118) of deaths could have been averted had the 40% target set by WHO been met by each country by the end of 2021.
Interpretation
COVID-19 vaccination has substantially altered the course of the pandemic, saving tens of millions of lives globally. However, inadequate access to vaccines in low-income countries has limited the impact in these settings, reinforcing the need for global vaccine equity and coverage.

AB  - Summary
Background
COVID-19 has been shown to differently affect various demographic and clinical population subgroups. We aimed to describe trends in absolute and relative COVID-19-related mortality risks across clinical and demographic population subgroups during successive SARS-CoV-2 pandemic waves.
Methods
We did a retrospective cohort study in England using the OpenSAFELY platform with the approval of National Health Service England, covering the first five SARS-CoV-2 pandemic waves (wave one [wild-type] from March 23 to May 30, 2020; wave two [alpha (B.1.1.7)] from Sept 7, 2020, to April 24, 2021; wave three [delta (B.1.617.2)] from May 28 to Dec 14, 2021; wave four [omicron (B.1.1.529)] from Dec 15, 2021, to April 29, 2022; and wave five [omicron] from June 24 to Aug 3, 2022). In each wave, we included people aged 18–110 years who were registered with a general practice on the first day of the wave and who had at least 3 months of continuous general practice registration up to this date. We estimated crude and sex-standardised and age-standardised wave-specific COVID-19-related death rates and relative risks of COVID-19-related death in population subgroups.
Findings
18 895 870 adults were included in wave one, 19 014 720 in wave two, 18 932 050 in wave three, 19 097 970 in wave four, and 19 226 475 in wave five. Crude COVID-19-related death rates per 1000 person-years decreased from 4·48 deaths (95% CI 4·41–4·55) in wave one to 2·69 (2·66–2·72) in wave two, 0·64 (0·63–0·66) in wave three, 1·01 (0·99–1·03) in wave four, and 0·67 (0·64–0·71) in wave five. In wave one, the standardised COVID-19-related death rates were highest in people aged 80 years or older, people with chronic kidney disease stage 5 or 4, people receiving dialysis, people with dementia or learning disability, and people who had received a kidney transplant (ranging from 19·85 deaths per 1000 person-years to 44·41 deaths per 1000 person-years, compared with from 0·05 deaths per 1000 person-years to 15·93 deaths per 1000 person-years in other subgroups). In wave two compared with wave one, in a largely unvaccinated population, the decrease in COVID-19-related mortality was evenly distributed across population subgroups. In wave three compared with wave one, larger decreases in COVID-19-related death rates were seen in groups prioritised for primary SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, including people aged 80 years or older and people with neurological disease, learning disability, or severe mental illness (90–91% decrease). Conversely, smaller decreases in COVID-19-related death rates were observed in younger age groups, people who had received organ transplants, and people with chronic kidney disease, haematological malignancies, or immunosuppressive conditions (0–25% decrease). In wave four compared with wave one, the decrease in COVID-19-related death rates was smaller in groups with lower vaccination coverage (including younger age groups) and conditions associated with impaired vaccine response, including people who had received organ transplants and people with immunosuppressive conditions (26–61% decrease).
Interpretation
There was a substantial decrease in absolute COVID-19-related death rates over time in the overall population, but demographic and clinical relative risk profiles persisted and worsened for people with lower vaccination coverage or impaired immune response. Our findings provide an evidence base to inform UK public health policy for protecting these vulnerable population subgroups.

AB  - Despite concerted efforts by health authorities worldwide to contain COVID-19, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has continued to spread and mutate into new variants with uncertain transmission characteristics. Therefore, there is a need for new data-driven models for determining optimal vaccination strategies that adapt to the new variants with their uncertain transmission characteristics. Motivated by this challenge, we derive an integrated chance constraints stochastic programming (ICC-SP) approach for finding vaccination strategies for epidemics that incorporates population demographics for any region of the world, uncertain disease transmission and vaccine efficacy. An optimal vaccination strategy specifies the proportion of individuals in a given household-type to vaccinate to bring the reproduction number to below one. The ICC-SP approach provides a quantitative method that allows to bound the expected excess of the reproduction number above one by an acceptable amount according to the decision-maker’s level of risk. This new methodology involves a multi-community household based epidemiology model that uses census demographics data, vaccination status, age-related heterogeneity in disease susceptibility and infectivity, virus variants, and vaccine efficacy. The new methodology was tested on real data for seven neighboring counties in the United States state of Texas. The results are promising and show, among other findings, that vaccination strategies for controlling an outbreak should prioritize vaccinating certain household sizes as well as age groups with relatively high combined susceptibility and infectivity.

AB  - Objectives
The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term effectiveness of COVID-19 pandemic prevention measures in saving lives after European governments began to lift restrictions.
Study design
Excess mortality interrupted time series.
Methods
Country-level weekly data on deaths were fitted to the Poisson mixed linear model to estimate excess deaths. Based on this estimate, the percentage of excess deaths above the baseline during the pandemic (week 11 in 2020 to week 15 in 2022) (when public health interventions were in place) and during the post-pandemic period (week 16 in 2022 to week 52 in 2022) were calculated. These results were fitted to the linear regression model to determine any potential relationship between mortality during these two periods.
Results
The model used in this study had high predictive value (adjusted R2 = 59.4%). Mortality during the endemic (post-pandemic) period alone increased by 7.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.7, 8.6) above baseline, while each percentage increase in mortality during the pandemic corresponded to a 0.357% reduction (95% CI: 0.243, 0.471) in mortality during the post-pandemic period.
Conclusions
The most successful countries in terms of protective measures also experienced the highest mortality rates after restrictions were lifted. The model used in this study clearly shows a measure of bidirectional mortality displacement that is sufficiently clear to mask any impact of long COVID on overall mortality. Results from this study also seriously impact previous cost-benefit analyses of pandemic prevention measures, since, according to the current model, 12.2% (95% CI: 8.3, 16.1) of the gains achieved in pandemic containment were lost after restrictions were lifted.

AB  - There is a strong coordinated effort by vaccination groups all over the world to put an end to the current crisis of COVID-19. Now sufficient data are available to analyse and compare some results to explore the aftereffects of vaccination. Some influence variables on transmissions of the disease were discussed e.g., mass vaccination, lockdown and seasonality. Most studies covered here are up to the beginning of July 2022, while some analyses focused on the earlier period of mass vaccination. Well established, simple statistical techniques to evaluate results were presented those used open data sources of authoritative bodies. Some comparisons between vaccinated vs. unvaccinated were also discussed based on data from UK Government Health Security Agency (UHSA). In terms of mass vaccination, adverse reactions after vaccination received attention, as health and safety issues of the general public are of prime importance. Apart from direct side effects, the secondary effect of mass vaccination needs attention too. After the initiation of the vaccination programme, almost all countries experienced a sudden surge in transmission and most countries had to impose strict lockdown measures. Many countries, with a low prevalence of disease, suddenly showed a steep jump and some countries even followed a synchronized pattern between the rate of transmissions and the variation of vaccine doses. Time series analyses and bar diagram presentations were able to capture those features. In that context, fast mutation of the virus and new variants after mass vaccination and possible mechanisms/consequences were also attended. To understand the effect of seasonality, similarities between COVID-19 and the seasonal Flu are discussed for Europe and US to gain useful insight. Using time series analyses and spatial plots of regional temperature composites we showed, like Flu, seasonality played a dominant role in transmissions of COVID-19 in the Europe. Regulations of vaccine dose and policy implication were explored too. From 22nd December 2021, global vaccine doses were reduced substantially, which followed a dramatic reduction in cases and thereafter deaths with around one month's lag between each. As strong dependency on seasonality is noticed in certain countries and observing that regulation of vaccine doses has roles in modulating the transmission with certain lags, globally as well as regionally, our results have policy implications for the management of COVID. Debating, questioning and criticism are always the foundation of great science and the major pillars of its progress. Following that objective, it is an effort to explore pragmatically, supported by scientific analyses, areas relating to the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine and the exit strategy via the pathway of vaccination.

AB  - Background
Patients with diabetes and obesity are populations at high-risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes and have shown blunted immune responses when administered different vaccines. Here we used the ‘ANRS0001S COV-POPART’ French nationwide multicenter prospective cohort to investigate early humoral response to COVID-19 vaccination in the sub-cohort (‘COVPOP OBEDIAB’) of patients with obesity and diabetes.
Methods
Patients with diabetes (n = 390, type 1 or 2) or obesity (n = 357) who had received two vaccine doses and had no history of previous COVID-19 infection and negative anti-nucleocapsid (NCP) antibodies were included and compared against healthy subjects (n = 573). Humoral response was assessed at baseline, at one month post-first dose (M0) and one-month post-second dose (M1), through percentage of responders (positive anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (Sabs), geometric means of Sabs; BAU/mL), proportion of individuals with anti-RBD antibodies, and proportion of individuals with anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (Nabs). Potential clinical and biological factors associated with weak response (defined as Sabs < 264 BAU/mL) and presence of non-reactive anti-RBD antibodies at M1 were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate regressions were performed to estimate crude and adjusted coefficients with 95 % confidence intervals. Poor glycemic control was defined as HbA1c ≥ 7.5 % at inclusion.
Results
Patients with diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, and patients with obesity were less likely to have positive Sabs and anti-RBD antibodies after the first and second dose compared to controls (p < 0.001). At M1, we found Sabs seroconversion in 94.1 % of patients with diabetes versus 99.7 % in controls, anti-RBD seroconversion in 93.8 % of patients with diabetes versus 99.1 % in controls, and Nabs seroconversion in 95.7 % of patients with diabetes versus 99.6 % in controls (all p < 0.0001). Sabs and anti-RBD seroconversion at M0 and M1 were also significantly lower in obese patients than controls, at respectively 82.1 % versus 89.9 % (p = 0.001; M0 Sabs), 94.4 % versus 99.7 % (p 0.001; M1 Sabs), 79.0 % vs 86.2 % (p = 0.004 M0 anti-RBD), and 96.99 % vs 99.1 % (p = 0.012 M1 anti-RBD). The factors associated with low vaccine response (BAU < 264/mL) in patients with diabetes were chronic kidney disease (adjusted OR = 6.88 [1.77;26.77], p = 0.005) and poor glycemic control (adjusted OR = 3.92 [1.26;12.14], p = 0.018). In addition, BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 was found to be associated with a higher vaccine response (adjusted OR = 0.10 [0.01;0.91], p = 0.040) than patients with BMI < 40 kg/m2.
Conclusion
COVID-19 vaccine humoral response was lower in patients with obesity and diabetes one month after second dose compared to controls, especially in diabetic patients with CKD or inadequate glycemic control. These findings point to the need for post-vaccination serological checks in these high-risk populations.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and its variants have brought unprecedented impacts to the global public health system, politics, economy, and other fields. Although more than ten COVID-19 specific vaccines have been approved for emergency use, COVID-19 prevention and control still face many challenges. Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) is the only authorized vaccine used to fight against tuberculosis (TB), it has been hypothesized that BCG may prevent and control COVID-19 based on BCG-induced nonspecific immune responses. Herein, we summarized: 1) The nonspecific protection effects of BCG, such as prophylactic protection effects of BCG on nonmycobacterial infections, immunotherapy effects of BCG vaccine, and enhancement effect of BCG vaccine on unrelated vaccines; 2) Recent evidence of BCG's efficacy against SARS-COV-2 infection from ecological studies, analytical analyses, clinical trials, and animal studies; 3) Three possible mechanisms of BCG vaccine and their effects on COVID-19 control including heterologous immunity, trained immunity, and anti-inflammatory effect. We hope that this review will encourage more scientists to investigate further BCG induced non-specific immune responses and explore their mechanisms, which could be a potential tool for addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19-like “Black Swan” events to reduce the impacts of infectious disease outbreaks on public health, politics, and economy.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is likely to remain endemic globally despite widespread vaccination. There is increasing concern for myocardial involvement and ensuing cardiac complications due to COVID-19, however, the available evidence suggests these risks are low. Pandemic publishing has resulted in rapid manuscript availability though pre-print servers. Subsequent article retractions, a lack of standardised definitions, over-reliance on isolated troponin elevation and the heterogeneity of studied patient groups (i.e. severe vs. symptomatic vs all infections) resulted in early concern for high rates of myocarditis in patients with and recovering from COVID-19. The estimated incidence of myocarditis in COVID-19 infection is 11 cases per 100,000 infections compared with an estimated 2.7 cases per 100,000 persons following mRNA vaccination. For substantiated cases, the clinical course of myocarditis related to COVID-19 or mRNA vaccination appears mild and self-limiting, with reports of severe/fulminant myocarditis being rare. There is limited data available on the management of myocarditis in these settings. Clinical guidance for appropriate use of cardiac investigations and monitoring in COVID-19 is needed for effective risk stratification and efficient use of cardiac resources in Australia. An amalgamation of national and international position statements and guidelines is helpful for guiding clinical practice. This paper reviews the current available evidence and guidelines and provides a summary of the risks and potential use of cardiac investigations and monitoring for patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Objectives
At the end of 2020, many countries commenced a vaccination programme against SARS-CoV-2. Public health authorities aim to prevent and interrupt outbreaks of infectious disease in social care settings. We aimed to investigate the association between the introduction of the vaccination programme and the frequency and duration of COVID-19 outbreaks in Northern Ireland (NI).
Study design
We undertook an ecological study using routinely available national data.
Methods
We used Poisson regression to measure the relationship between the number of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks in care homes, and as a measure of community COVID-19 prevalence, the Office for National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey estimated the number of people testing positive for COVID-19 in NI. We estimated the change in this relationship and estimated the expected number of care home outbreaks in the absence of the vaccination programme. A Cox proportional hazards model estimated the hazard ratio of a confirmed COVID-19 care home outbreak closure.
Results
Care home outbreaks reduced by two-thirds compared to expected following the introduction of the vaccination programme, from a projected 1625 COVID-19 outbreaks (95% prediction interval 1553–1694) between 7 December 2020 and 28 October 2021 to an observed 501. We estimated an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.53 of the outbreak closure assuming a 21-day lag for immunity.
Conclusions
These findings describe the association of the vaccination with a reduction in outbreak frequency and duration across NI care homes. This indicates probable reduced harm and disruption from COVID-19 in social care settings following vaccination. Future research using individual level data from care home residents will be needed to investigate the effectiveness of the vaccines and the duration of their effects.
