AB  - The essential role of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in immune system regulation and combatting infectious diseases cannot be fully recognized without an understanding of the changes in its N-glycans attached to the asparagine 297 of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain that occur under such circumstances. These glycans impact the antibody stability, half-life, secretion, immunogenicity, and effector functions. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed and compared the total IgG glycome—at the level of individual glycan structures and derived glycosylation traits (sialylation, galactosylation, fucosylation, and bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc))—of 64 patients with influenza, 77 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and 56 healthy controls. Our study revealed a significant decrease in IgG galactosylation, sialylation, and bisecting GlcNAc (where the latter shows the most significant decrease) in deceased COVID-19 patients, whereas IgG fucosylation was increased. On the other hand, IgG galactosylation remained stable in influenza patients and COVID-19 survivors. IgG glycosylation in influenza patients was more time-dependent: In the first seven days of the disease, sialylation increased and fucosylation and bisecting GlcNAc decreased; in the next 21 days, sialylation decreased and fucosylation increased (while bisecting GlcNAc remained stable). The similarity of IgG glycosylation changes in COVID-19 survivors and influenza patients may be the consequence of an adequate immune response to enveloped viruses, while the observed changes in deceased COVID-19 patients may indicate its deviation.

AB  - Summary
Large GWAS indicated that genetic factors influence the response to SARS-CoV-2. However, sex, age, concomitant diseases, differences in ancestry, and uneven exposure to the virus impacted the interpretation of data. We aimed to perform a GWAS of COVID-19 outcome in a homogeneous population who experienced a high exposure to the virus and with a known infection status. We recruited inhabitants of Bergamo province—that in spring 2020 was the epicenter of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic in Europe—via an online questionnaire followed by personal interviews. Cases and controls were matched by age, sex and risk factors. We genotyped 1195 individuals and replicated the association at the 3p21.31 locus with severity, but with a stronger effect size that further increased in gravely ill patients. Transcriptome-wide association study highlighted eQTLs for LZTFL1 and CCR9. We also identified 17 loci not previously reported, suggestive for an association with either COVID-19 severity or susceptibility.

AB  - Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the male sex is a significant risk factor for severe disease and mortality due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the precise explanation for the discrepancy is currently unclear. Immunologically, the female-biased protection against COVID-19 could presumably be due to a more rapid and robust immune response to viruses exhibited by males. The female hormones, e.g., estrogens and progesterone, may have protective roles against viral infections. In contrast, male hormones, e.g., testosterone, can act oppositely. Besides, the expression of the ACE-2 receptor in the lung and airway lining, which the SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter cells, is more pronounced in males. Estrogen potentially plays a role in downregulating the expression of ACE-2, which could be a plausible biological explanation for the reduced severity of COVID-19 in females. Comorbidities, e.g., cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and kidney disorders, are considered significant risk factors for severe outcomes in COVID-19. Age-adjusted data shows that males are statistically more predisposed to these morbidities—amplifying risks for males with COVID-19. In addition, many sociocultural factors and gender-constructed behavior of men and women impact exposure to infections and outcomes. In many parts of the world, women are more likely to abide by health regulations, e.g., mask-wearing and handwashing, than men. In contrast, men, in general, are more involved with high-risk behaviors, e.g., smoking and alcohol consumption, and high-risk jobs that require admixing with people, which increases their risk of exposure to the infection. Overall, males and females suffer differently from COVID-19 due to a complex interplay between many biological and sociocultural factors.

AB  - Background
Literature is limited on the impact of patient vaccination on the risk of hospital-acquired influenza (HAI). This test negative case-control study nested in a surveillance program aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in reducing the risk of HAI in hospitalized patients during 15 influenza seasons (2004–05 to 2019–20).
Methods
HAI cases were those who developed influenza like illness (ILI) symptoms at least 72 h after hospitalization and had a positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Controls were those with ILI symptoms and a negative RT-PCR test. A nasal swab as well as socio-demographic, clinical data and information on influenza vaccination were collected.
Results
Of the 296 patients included, 67 were confirmed HAI cases. Influenza vaccine coverage was significantly higher among controls compared to HAI cases (p = 0.002). The risk of HAI was reduced by almost 60 % in vaccinated patients.
Conclusions
A better control of HAI can be achieved by vaccinating hospitalized patients.

AB  - Background
The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread to more than 210 countries and regions around the world, with different characteristics recorded depending on the location. A systematic summarization of COVID-19 outbreaks that occurred during the “dynamic zero-COVID” policy period in Chinese mainland had not been previously conducted. In-depth mining of the big data from the past two years of the COVID-19 pandemics must be performed to clarify their epidemiological characteristics and dynamic transmissions.
Methods
Trajectory clustering was used to group epidemic and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) curves of mass outbreaks into different models and reveal the epidemiological characteristics and dynamic transmissions of COVID-19. For the selected single-peak epidemic curves, we constructed a peak-point judgment model based on the dynamic slope and adopted a single-peak fitting model to identify the key time points and peak parameters. Finally, we developed an extreme gradient boosting-based prediction model for peak infection cases based on the total number of infections on the first 3, 5, and 7 days of the initial average incubation period.
Results
(1) A total of 7 52298 cases, including 587 outbreaks in 251 cities in Chinese mainland between June 11, 2020, and June 29, 2022, were collected, and the first wave of COVID-19 outbreaks was excluded. Excluding the Shanghai outbreak in 2022, the 586 remaining outbreaks resulted in 1 25425 infections, with an infection rate of 4.21 per 1 00000 individuals. The number of outbreaks varied based on location, season, and temperature. (2) Trajectory clustering analysis showed that 77 epidemic curves were divided into four patterns, which were dominated by two single-peak clustering patterns (63.3%). A total of 77 Rt curves were grouped into seven patterns, with the leading patterns including four downward dynamic transmission patterns (74.03%). These curves revealed that the interval from peak to the point where the Rt value dropped below 1 was approximately 5 days. (3) The peak-point judgment model achieved a better result in the area under the curve (0.96, 95% confidence interval = 0.90–1.00). The single-peak fitting results on the epidemic curves indicated that the interval from the slow-growth point to the sharp-decline point was approximately 4–6 days in more than 50% of mass outbreaks. (4) The peak-infection-case prediction model exhibited the superior clustering results of epidemic and Rt curves compared with the findings without grouping.
Conclusion
Overall, our findings suggest the variation in the infection rates during the “dynamic zero-COVID” policy period based on the geographic division, level of economic development, seasonal division, and temperature. Trajectory clustering can be a useful tool for discovering epidemiological characteristics and dynamic transmissions, judging peak points, and predicting peak infection cases using different patterns.

AB  - Summary
Background
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Test-Trace-Isolate (TTI) programs have been recommended as a risk mitigation strategy. However, many governments have hesitated to implement them due to their costs. This study aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of implementing a national TTI program to reduce the number of severe and fatal cases of COVID-19 in Colombia.
Methods
We developed a Markov simulation model of COVID-19 infection combined with a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered structure. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive TTI strategy compared to no intervention over a one-year horizon, from both the health system and the societal perspective. Hospitalization and mortality rates were retrieved from Colombian surveillance data. We included program costs of TTI intervention, health services utilization, PCR diagnosis test, productivity loss, and government social program costs. We used the number of deaths and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as health outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were performed.
Findings
Compared with no intervention, the TTI strategy reduces COVID-19 mortality by 67%. In addition, the program saves an average of $1,045 and $850 per case when observed from the social and the health system perspective, respectively. These savings are equivalent to two times the current health expenditures in Colombia per year.
Interpretation
The TTI program is a highly cost-effective public health intervention to reduce the burden of COVID-19 in Colombia. TTI programs depend on their successful and speedy implementation.
Funding
This study was supported by the Colombian Ministry of Health through award number PUJ-04519-20 received by EPQ AVO and SDS declined to receive any funding support for this study. The contents are the responsibility of all the individual authors.

AB  - Objective
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo raised concerns regarding additional morbidity and mortality. Updating these indicators before a second wave is essential in order to prepare for additional help.
Methods
From mid-May to mid-December 2020, weekly surveys were undertaken in sampled streets from 10 health areas to quantify the use of barrier measures, and interview pedestrians about sickness and deaths in their households. Crude death rates (CDRs) were estimated.
Results
Minimal use or no use of face masks was observed in at least half of the streets. From May to December 2020, the number of suspected cases of COVID-19 increased six-fold (P < 0.05). Of deaths within 30 days preceding the interviews, 20% were considered to be related to COVID-19. The monthly CDRs at the beginning and end of the study were approximately 5 and 25 per 1000 population, respectively (P < 0.05); that is, annual CDRs of 60 and 260 per 1000 population, respectively. Thus, during the first wave, the estimated mortality rate increased by 50% compared with previous years, and increased at least four-fold by the end of 2020.
Conclusion
Despite possible overestimations, the excess mortality in South Kivu is extremely concerning. This crisis calls for a rapid response and increased humanitarian assistance.

AB  - Summary
Up to 50% of the people who have died from COVID-19 had metabolic and vascular disorders. Notably, there are many direct links between COVID-19 and the metabolic and endocrine systems. Thus, not only are patients with metabolic dysfunction (eg, obesity, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and diabetes) at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 but also infection with SARS-CoV-2 might lead to new-onset diabetes or aggravation of pre-existing metabolic disorders. In this Review, we provide an update on the mechanisms of how metabolic and endocrine disorders might predispose patients to develop severe COVID-19. Additionally, we update the practical recommendations and management of patients with COVID-19 and post-pandemic. Furthermore, we summarise new treatment options for patients with both COVID-19 and diabetes, and highlight current challenges in clinical management.

The particular measured factors, which underwent standardization, were assessed for mutual dependency by means of a Pearson correlation coefficient and analysed by a linear regression. Based on the presented models, our results indicate that air quality (air pollution level) is the most important factor in the context of enabling COVID-19 case load increase in Poland.

AB  - Introduction
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been particularly challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to analyse the impact of infection with COVID-19 in children post-HSCT and describe the clinical syndromes and the disease manifestations in this cohort. Patients and methods: Children who underwent HSCT between January 2019 to June 2021 and acquired COVID-19 infection were included in the study. The symptomatic children were hospitalized for supportive care. Asymptomatic children were treated in home isolation with azithromycin and zinc supplements. Children who were on immunosuppressants were continued on it. Results: A total of 9/265 children who underwent HSCT in the study period were diagnosed with COVID-19, the incidence being 3.3%. The cycle threshold value in all children was low (≤17), indicating a profound viremia. All children had cytopenia, four had hyponatremia, and two had grade 2 cytokine release syndrome. The severity of the disease was mild in 5 children, moderate in 1 child, and severe in 3 children. Post COVID sequelae included ARDS (n = 1), MIS-C and DVT (n = 1), rhinocerebral rhizopus infection (n = 1). Three children with severe infection died, two due to multiorgan dysfunction and one due to fungal infection. Conclusion: The presence of GVHD, opportunistic fungal infection, and hyponatremia help predict a severe course and mortality in children post HSCT who are diagnosed to have COVID-19 infection. Prophylaxis for mucormycosis in high-risk children with GVHD is an essential aspect of management.

AB  - This paper explores the link between personal experience with COVID-19 and US retail investors’ financial decision-making during the first COVID-19 wave. Do retail investors that have personally experienced COVID-19 change their investments after the pandemic outbreak, and if so, why? We use a cross-sectional dataset from an online survey of US retail investors collected in July and August 2020 to assess if and how respondents change their investment decisions after the COVID-19 outbreak. On average retail investors increase their investments during the first wave of COVID-19 by 4.7%, while many of them decrease their investments suggesting a high heterogeneity of investor behaviours. We provide the first evidence that personal experience with the virus can have unexpected positive effects on retail investments. Investors who have personal experience with COVID-19, who are in a vulnerable health category, who tested positive, and who know someone in their close circle of friends or family who died because of COVID-19, increase their investments by 12%. We explain our findings through terror management theory, salience theory and optimism bias, suggesting that reminders of mortality, focussing on selective salient investment information, and over-optimism despite personal vulnerable health contribute to the increase in retail investments. Increased levels of savings, saving goals and risk capacity are also positively associated with increased investments. Our findings are relevant to investors, regulators, and financial advisors, and highlight the importance of providing retail investors with access to investment opportunities in periods of unprecedented shocks such as COVID-19.

The goal of the present study was to investigate whether peripheral blood type I interferon (IFN) signature and interleukin (IL)-6 serum levels -previously shown to contribute to COVID-19-related outcomes in hospitalized patients- is shaped by demographic contributors among COVID-19 convalescent individuals.
Patients and Methods
Type I IFN-inducible genes in peripheral blood, as well as serum IL-6 levels were quantified in 61 COVID-19 convalescent healthy individuals (34 females, 27 males; age range 18–70 years, mean 35.7 ± 15.9 years) who recovered from COVID-19 without requiring hospitalization within a median of 3 months prior to inclusion in the present study. Among those, 17 were older than 50 years (11 males, 6 females) and 44 equal to or less than 50 years (16 males, 28 females). Expression analysis of type I IFN-inducible genes (MX-1, IFIT-1, IFI44) was performed by real time PCR and a type I IFN score, reflecting type I IFN peripheral activity, was calculated. IL-6 and C-reactive protein levels were determined by a commercially available ELISA.
Results
COVID-19 convalescent individuals older than 50 years exhibited significantly decreased peripheral blood type I IFN scores along with significantly increased IL-6 serum levels compared to their younger counterparts less than 50 years old (5.4 ± 4.3 vs 16.8 ± 24.7, p = 0.02 and 10.6 ± 16.9 vs 2.9 ± 8.0 ng/L, p = 0.03, respectively). Following sex stratification, peripheral blood type I IFN score was found to be significantly higher in younger females compared to both younger and older males (22.9 ± 29.2 vs 6.3 ± 4.6 vs 4.5 ± 3.7, p = 0.01 and p = 0.002, respectively). Regarding IL-6, an opposite pattern was observed, with the highest levels being detected among older males and the lowest levels among younger females (11.6 ± 18.9 vs 2.5 ± 7.8 ng/L, p = 0.03).
Conclusion
Constitutive higher type I IFN responses and dampened IL-6 production observed in younger women of premenopausal age, along with lower type I IFN responses and increased IL-6 levels in older males, could account for the discrete clinical outcomes seen in the two population groups, as consistently revealed in COVID-19 epidemiological studies.

AB  - Purpose
We investigated whether the relationship between extroversion and mortality changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
Midlife Americans were surveyed in 1995–96 with mortality follow-up through December 31, 2020. We used a Cox model to estimate age-specific mortality controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, the period trend in mortality, an indicator for the pandemic period (Mar-Dec 2020), extroversion, and an interaction between extroversion and the pandemic indicator.
Results
Prior to the pandemic, extroversion was associated with somewhat lower mortality (HR = 0.93 per SD, 95% CI 0.88–0.97), but the relationship reversed during the pandemic. Extroversion was associated with greater pandemic-related excess mortality (HR = 1.29 per SD, 95% CI 1.002–1.67). That is, compared with persons who were more introverted, those who were highly extroverted suffered a bigger increase in mortality during the pandemic relative to pre-pandemic mortality levels.
Conclusions
The slight mortality advantage enjoyed by more extroverted Americans prior to the pandemic disappeared during the first 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We suspect that the mortality benefit of introversion during the pandemic is largely a result of reduced exposure to the risk of infection, but it may also derive in part from the ability of more introverted individuals to adapt more easily to reduced social interaction without engaging in self-destructive behavior (e.g., drug and alcohol abuse).

AB  - Background
Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are highly susceptible from respiratory exacerbations from viral respiratory tract infections. However, it is unclear whether they are at increased risk of COVID-19 pneumonia or COVID-19-related mortality. We aimed to determine whether COPD is a risk factor for adverse COVID-19 outcomes including hospitalization, severe COVID-19, or death.
Methods
Following the PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic review of COVID-19 clinical studies published between November 1st, 2019 and January 28th, 2021 (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020191491). We included studies that quantified the number of COPD patients, and reported at least one of the following outcomes stratified by COPD status: hospitalization; severe COVID-19; ICU admission; mechanical ventilation; acute respiratory distress syndrome; or mortality. We meta-analyzed the results of individual studies to determine the odds ratio (OR) of these outcomes in patients with COPD compared to those without COPD.
Findings
Fifty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria, and underwent data extraction. Most studies were retrospective cohort studies/case series of hospitalized patients. Only four studies examined the effects of COPD on COVID-19 outcomes as their primary endpoint. In aggregate, COPD was associated with increased odds of hospitalization (OR 4.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.65–4.90), ICU admission (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.02–1.78), and mortality (OR 2.47, 95% CI 2.18–2.79).
Interpretation
Having a clinical diagnosis of COPD significantly increases the odds of poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. COPD patients should thus be considered a high-risk group, and targeted for preventative measures and aggressive treatment for COVID-19 including vaccination.

AB  - COVID-19 vaccines have been available for over a year, yet 26% of U.S. young adults remain unvaccinated. This study examines racial and ethnic disparities in young adult vaccine hesitancy and attitudes/beliefs that mediate disparities in vaccine hesitancy. Young adults (n = 2041;Mean[SD]:21.3[0.7] years-old) from a Los Angeles, CA, USA cohort were surveyed online in January–May 2021 and classified as vaccine hesitant (those who reported “Not at all likely”/“Not very likely” /“Slightly likely” to get vaccinated) versus non-hesitant (those who reported “Moderately likely”/”Very likely”/”Definitely likely” to get vaccinated or already vaccinated). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine racial/ethnic disparities in vaccine hesitancy. Factor analysis was conducted to create three subscales toward vaccination: positive, negative, and lack-of-access beliefs. Mediation analyses were performed to assess pathways from attitude/belief subscales to racial disparities in vaccine hesitancy. Overall 33.0% of respondents reported vaccine hesitancy. Black vs. White young adults had a higher prevalence of vaccine hesitancy (AOR[95%CI] = 4.3[2.4–7.8]), and Asians vs. Whites had a lower prevalence (AOR[95%CI] = 0.5[0.3–0.8]). Mediators explained 90% of the Black (vs. White) disparity in vaccine hesitancy, including significant indirect effects through positive belief–reducing (β = 0.23,p < .001) and negative belief–enhancing (β = 0.02,p = .04) effects. About 81% of the Asian (vs. White) disparity in vaccine hesitancy was explained by the three combined subscales, including significant positive belief–reducing (β = −0.18,p < .001) indirect effect. Substantial racial and ethnic disparities in young adult COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were found, which were mediated by differences in attitudes and beliefs toward vaccination. Targeted education campaigns and messages are needed to promote equitable utilization of the effective vaccine.

AB  - Objectives
In addition to being home to more than seven million HIV-infected individuals, South Africa also has a high burden of COVID-19 and related comorbidities worldwide. We aimed to identify the most influential “beliefs” and “attitudes” on vaccine decision-making behavior.
Study design
This study used panel data from cross-sectional surveys.
Methods
We used the data from Black South Africans who participated in the “COVID-19 Vaccine Surveys” (November 2021 and February/March 2022) in South Africa. Besides standard risk factor analysis, such as multivariable logistic regression models, we also used the modified version of population attributable risk percent and estimated the population-level impacts of beliefs and attitudes on vaccine decision-making behavior using the methodology in multifactorial setting.
Results
A total of 1399 people (57% men and 43% women) who participated in both surveys were analyzed. Of these, 336 (24%) reported being vaccinated in survey 2. Overall low perceived risk, concerns around efficacy, and safety were identified as the most influential factors and associated with 52%–72% (<40 years) and 34%–55% (40+ years) of the unvaccinated individuals.
Conclusion
Our findings highlighted the most influential beliefs and attitudes on vaccine decision-making and their population-level impacts, which are likely to have significant public health implications exclusively for this population.

AB  - Summary
Background
Several small studies on patients with COVID-19 and haematological malignancies are available showing a high mortality in this population. The Italian Hematology Alliance on COVID-19 aimed to collect data from adult patients with haematological malignancies who required hospitalisation for COVID-19.
Methods
This multicentre, retrospective, cohort study included adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with diagnosis of a WHO-defined haematological malignancy admitted to 66 Italian hospitals between Feb 25 and May 18, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed and symptomatic COVID-19. Data cutoff for this analysis was June 22, 2020. The primary outcome was mortality and evaluation of potential predictive parameters of mortality. We calculated standardised mortality ratios between observed death in the study cohort and expected death by applying stratum-specific mortality rates of the Italian population with COVID-19 and an Italian cohort of 31 993 patients with haematological malignancies without COVID-19 (data up to March 1, 2019). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify factors associated with overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04352556, and the prospective part of the study is ongoing.
Findings
We enrolled 536 patients with a median follow-up of 20 days (IQR 10–34) at data cutoff, 85 (16%) of whom were managed as outpatients. 440 (98%) of 451 hospitalised patients completed their hospital course (were either discharged alive or died). 198 (37%) of 536 patients died. When compared with the general Italian population with COVID-19, the standardised mortality ratio was 2·04 (95% CI 1·77–2·34) in our whole study cohort and 3·72 (2·86–4·64) in individuals younger than 70 years. When compared with the non-COVID-19 cohort with haematological malignancies, the standardised mortality ratio was 41·3 (38·1–44·9). Older age (hazard ratio 1·03, 95% CI 1·01–1·05); progressive disease status (2·10, 1·41–3·12); diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (3·49, 1·56–7·81), indolent non-Hodgin lymphoma (2·19, 1·07–4·48), aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (2·56, 1·34–4·89), or plasma cell neoplasms (2·48, 1·31–4·69), and severe or critical COVID-19 (4·08, 2·73–6·09) were associated with worse overall survival.
Interpretation
This study adds to the evidence that patients with haematological malignancies have worse outcomes than both the general population with COVID-19 and patients with haematological malignancies without COVID-19. The high mortality among patients with haematological malignancies hospitalised with COVID-19 highlights the need for aggressive infection prevention strategies, at least until effective vaccination or treatment strategies are available.

AB  - California agricultural workers are predominately Latino/a, are medically underserved, and reside in larger households, placing them at elevated COVID-19 risk at work and at home. While some research has examined COVID-19 among agricultural workers in the interior of the United States, little research exists on experiences of COVID-19 along the US-Mexico border. Grounded in resilience thinking, this study aims to understand how agricultural workers navigated their heightened risk to COVID-19 at work and at home, and made use of available resources in the context of a bi-national community. Our study utilized qualitative interviews with 12 agricultural workers to understanding the COVID-19 experiences of resident and daily migrant agricultural workers in Imperial County, California, located along the US-Mexico border. Findings suggest that agricultural workers faced significant impacts and risks at work (work stoppages, stress about bringing COVID-19 home to family) and at home (contracting COVID-19, loss of friends and family, and mental health challenges). Agricultural workers and their employers often implemented COVID-19 precautions such as social distancing measures, personal protective equipment, hand washing and hand sanitizers, and isolation. Many agricultural workers did access testing resources on either side of the US-Mexico border and worked with US-based Spanish-speaking community-based organizations to register for vaccine appointments. To better support agricultural workers and their employers in the future, we recommend the following: 1. Prioritize agricultural workplace conditions to increase agricultural worker physical and mental health, 2. Extend public health services into agricultural work sites of transit and the workplace, and 3. Lastly, trusted Spanish-speaking community-based organizations can play a critical role in public health outreach.

AB  - We investigate herding in ten equity markets during the COVID-19 pandemic using a methodology that considers movements in assets due to changes in fundamentals. We find heterogeneous patterns in herding across the ten countries during the pandemic, but overall, there is limited evidence of herding during this period, with only Italy, Sweden, and the United States displaying signs of herding. A cross-sectional analysis reveals that herding measures during the pandemic are negatively associated with stricter governmental actions that restrict mobility, and positively associated with economic support measures.

AB  - Objectives
To assess the economic burden of COVID-19 that would arise absent behavioral or policy responses under the herd immunity approach in the United States and compare it to the total burden that also accounts for estimates of the value of lives lost.
Methods
We use the trajectories of age-specific human and physical capital in the production process to calculate output changes based on a human capital–augmented production function. We also calculate the total burden that results when including the value of lives lost as calculated from mortality rates of COVID-19 and estimates for the value of a statistical life in the United States based on studies assessing individual’s willingness to pay to avoid risks.
Results
Our results indicate that the GDP loss associated with unmitigated COVID-19 would amount to a cumulative US$1.4 trillion by 2030 assuming that 60 percent of the population is infected over three years. This is equivalent to around 7.7 percent of GDP in 2019 (in constant 2010 US$) or an average tax on yearly output of 0.6 percent. After applying the value of a statistical life to account for the value of lives lost, our analyses show that the total burden can mount to between US$17 and 94 trillion over the next decade, which is equivalent to an annual tax burden between 8 and 43 percent.
Conclusion
Our results show that the United States would incur a sizeable burden if it adopted a non-interventionist herd immunity approach.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and can be associated with serious complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. This condition is accompanied by a massive release of cytokines, also denominated cytokine storm, development of systemic oxidative stress and a prothrombotic state. In this context, it has been proposed a role for acetylcysteine (NAC) in the management of patients with COVID-19. NAC is a molecule classically known for its mucolytic effect, but it also has direct and indirect antioxidant activity as a precursor of reduced glutathione. Other effects of NAC have also been described, such as modulating the immune and inflammatory response, counteracting the thrombotic state, and having an antiviral effect. The pharmacological activities of NAC and its effects on the mechanisms of disease progression make it a potential therapeutic agent for COVID-19. NAC is safe, tolerable, affordable, and easily available. Moreover, the antioxidant effects of the molecule may even prevent infection and play an important role as a complement to vaccination. Although the clinical efficacy and dosing regimens of NAC have been evaluated in the clinical setting with small series of patients, the results are promising. In this article, we review the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the current knowledge of the mechanisms of action of NAC across disease stages. We also propose NAC posology strategies to manage COVID-19 patients in different clinical scenarios.

AB  - Background
Regular physical activity (PA) has been postulated to improve, or at least maintain, immunity across the life span. However, the link between physical (in)activity and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains to be established. This small-scale prospective cohort study is nested within a randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the possible associations between PA levels and clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.
Methods
Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (mean age: 54.9 years) were recruited from the Clinical Hospital of the School of Medicine of the University of Sao Paulo (a quaternary referral teaching hospital) and from Ibirapuera Field Hospital, both located in Sao Paulo, Brazil. PA level was assessed using the Baecke Questionnaire of Habitual Physical Activity. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay. The secondary outcomes were mortality, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and mechanical ventilation requirement.
Results
The median hospital length of stay was 7.0 ± 4.0 days, median ± IQR; 3.3% of patients died, 13.8% were admitted to the ICU, and 8.6% required mechanical ventilation. Adjusted linear regression models showed that PA indices were not associated with hospital length of stay (work index: β = –0.57 (95% confidence interval (95%CI): –1.80 to 0.65), p = 0.355; sport index: β = 0.43 (95%CI: –0.94 to 1.80), p = 0.536; leisure-time index: β = 1.18 (95%CI: –0.22 to 2.59), p = 0.099; and total activity index: β = 0.20 (95%CI: –0.48 to 0.87), p = 0.563). None of the PA indices were associated with mortality, admission to the ICU, or mechanical ventilation requirement (all p > 0.050).
Conclusion
Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, PA did not independently associate with hospital length of stay or any other clinically relevant outcomes. These findings should be interpreted as meaning that, among already hospitalized patients with more severe forms of COVID-19, being active is a potential protective factor likely outweighed by a cluster of comorbidities (e.g., type 2 diabetes, hypertension, weight excess) and older age, suggesting that the benefit of PA against the worsening of COVID-19 may vary across stages of the disease.

AB  - We simulate the impact of school reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic in three major urban centers in Brazil to identify the epidemiological indicators and the best timing for the return of in-school activities and the effect of contact tracing as a mitigation measure. Our goal is to offer guidelines for evidence-based policymaking. We implement an extended SEIR model stratified by age and considering contact networks in different settings – school, home, work, and community, in which the infection transmission rate is affected by various intervention measures. After fitting epidemiological and demographic data, we simulate scenarios with increasing school transmission due to school reopening, and also estimate the number of hospitalization and deaths averted by the implementation of contact tracing. Reopening schools results in a non-linear increase in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, which is highly dependent on infection and disease incidence at the time of reopening. When contact tracing and quarantining are restricted to school and home settings, a large number of daily tests is required to produce significant effects in reducing the total number of hospitalizations and deaths. Policymakers should carefully consider the epidemiological context and timing regarding the implementation of school closure and return of in-person school activities. While contact tracing strategies prevent new infections within school environments, they alone are not sufficient to avoid significant impacts on community transmission.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 has created and amplified racial health disparities. This has been particularly noticeable in populations with asthma. There is no one simple reason for this occurrence, but rather a complex interaction of biological, structural, and socioeconomic factors. This article will highlight reasons why the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has been particularly impactful among minority populations throughout the world and will also offer potential solutions to help overcome health disparities.

AB  - Summary
Background
Differences in the distribution of individual-level clinical risk factors across regions do not fully explain the observed global disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. We aimed to investigate the associations between environmental and societal factors and country-level variations in mortality attributed to COVID-19 among people with rheumatic disease globally.
Methods
In this observational study, we derived individual-level data on adults (aged 18–99 years) with rheumatic disease and a confirmed status of their highest COVID-19 severity level from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance (GRA) registry, collected between March 12, 2020, and Aug 27, 2021. Environmental and societal factors were obtained from publicly available sources. The primary endpoint was mortality attributed to COVID-19. We used a multivariable logistic regression to evaluate independent associations between environmental and societal factors and death, after controlling for individual-level risk factors. We used a series of nested mixed-effects models to establish whether environmental and societal factors sufficiently explained country-level variations in death.
Findings
14 044 patients from 23 countries were included in the analyses. 10 178 (72·5%) individuals were female and 3866 (27·5%) were male, with a mean age of 54·4 years (SD 15·6). Air pollution (odds ratio 1·10 per 10 μg/m3 [95% CI 1·01–1·17]; p=0·0105), proportion of the population aged 65 years or older (1·19 per 1% increase [1·10–1·30]; p<0·0001), and population mobility (1·03 per 1% increase in number of visits to grocery and pharmacy stores [1·02–1·05]; p<0·0001 and 1·02 per 1% increase in number of visits to workplaces [1·00–1·03]; p=0·032) were independently associated with higher odds of mortality. Number of hospital beds (0·94 per 1-unit increase per 1000 people [0·88–1·00]; p=0·046), human development index (0·65 per 0·1-unit increase [0·44–0·96]; p=0·032), government response stringency (0·83 per 10-unit increase in containment index [0·74–0·93]; p=0·0018), as well as follow-up time (0·78 per month [0·69–0·88]; p<0·0001) were independently associated with lower odds of mortality. These factors sufficiently explained country-level variations in death attributable to COVID-19 (intraclass correlation coefficient 1·2% [0·1–9·5]; p=0·14).
Interpretation
Our findings highlight the importance of environmental and societal factors as potential explanations of the observed regional disparities in COVID-19 outcomes among people with rheumatic disease and lay foundation for a new research agenda to address these disparities.

AB  - Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has helped to clarify the fair and equitable allocation of scarce medical resources, both within and among countries. The ethical allocation of such resources entails a three-step process: (1) elucidating the fundamental ethical values for allocation, (2) using these values to delineate priority tiers for scarce resources, and (3) implementing the prioritisation to faithfully realise the fundamental values. Myriad reports and assessments have elucidated five core substantive values for ethical allocation: maximising benefits and minimising harms, mitigating unfair disadvantage, equal moral concern, reciprocity, and instrumental value. These values are universal. None of the values are sufficient alone, and their relative weight and application will vary by context. In addition, there are procedural principles such as transparency, engagement, and evidence-responsiveness. Prioritising instrumental value and minimising harms during the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread agreement on priority tiers to include health-care workers, first responders, people living in congregate housing, and people with an increased risk of death, such as older adults and individuals with medical conditions. However, the pandemic also revealed problems with the implementation of these values and priority tiers, such as allocation on the basis of population rather than COVID-19 burden, and passive allocation that exacerbated disparities by requiring recipients to spend time booking and travelling to appointments. This ethical framework should be the starting point for the allocation of scarce medical resources in future pandemics and other public health conditions. For instance, allocation of the new malaria vaccine among sub-Saharan African countries should be based not on reciprocity to countries that participated in research, but on maximally reducing serious illness and deaths, especially among infants and children.

AB  - Covid-19 endangers lives, has disrupted normal life, changed the way medicine is practised and is likely to alter our world for the foreseeable future. Almost two years on since the presumptive first diagnosis of COVID-19 in China, more than two hundred and fifty million cases have been confirmed and more than five million people have died globally, with the figures rising daily. One of the most striking aspects of COVID-19 illness is the marked difference in individuals’ experiences of the disease. Some, most often younger groups, are asymptomatic, whereas others become severely ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia or proceed to fatal organ disease. The highest death rates are in the older and oldest age groups and in people with co-morbidities such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. Three major questions seem important to consider. What do we understand about changes in the immune system that might contribute to the older person’s risk of developing severe COVID-19? What factors contribute to the higher morbidity and mortality in older people with COVID-19? How could immunocompetence in the older and the frailest individuals and populations be supported and enhanced to give protection from serious COVID-19 illness?

AB  - Objectives
The drug overdose crisis with shifting patterns from primarily opioid to polysubstance uses and COVID-19 infections are 2 concurrent public health crises in the United States, affecting the population of sizes in different magnitudes (approximately < 10 million for substance use disorder [SUD] and drug overdoses vs 80 million for COVID-19 within 2 years of the pandemic). Our objective is to compare the relative scale of disease burden for the 2 crises within a common framework, which could help inform policy makers with resource allocation and prioritization strategies.
Methods
We calculated disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for SUD (including opioids and stimulants) and COVID-19 infections, respectively. We collected estimates for SUD prevalence, overdose deaths, COVID-19 cases and deaths, disability weights, and life expectancy from multiple publicly available sources. We then compared age distributions of estimated DALYs.
Results
We estimated a total burden of 13.83 million DALYs for SUD and drug overdoses and 15.03 million DALYs for COVID-19 in 2 years since March 2020. COVID-19 burden was dominated by the fatal burden (> 95% of total DALYs), whereas SUD burden was attributed to both fatal (53%) and nonfatal burdens (47%). The highest disease burden was among individuals aged 30 to 39 years for SUD (27%) and 50 to 64 years for COVID-19 (31%).
Conclusions
Despite the smaller size of the affected population, SUD and drug overdoses resulted in comparable disease burden with the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional resources supporting evidence-based interventions in prevention and treatment may be warranted to ameliorate SUD and drug overdoses during both the pandemic and postpandemic recovery.

Vaccination is a key public health intervention that can reduce excess mortality in humanitarian contexts. Vaccine hesitancy is thought to be a significant problem requiring demand side interventions. Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) approaches have proven effective in reducing perinatal mortality in low income settings and we aimed to apply an adapted approach in Somalia.

A randomised cluster trial was implemented in camps for internally displaced people near Mogadishu, from June to October 2021. An adapted PLA approach (hPLA) was used in partnership with indigenous ‘Abaay-Abaay’ women’s social groups. Trained facilitators ran 6 meeting cycles that addressed topics of child health and vaccination, analysed challenges, and planned and implemented potential solutions. Solutions included a stakeholder exchange meeting involving Abaay-Abaay group members and services providers from humanitarian organisations. Data was collected at baseline and after completion of the 3 month intervention cycle.
Results
Overall, 64.6% of mothers were group members at baseline and this increased in both arms during the intervention (p = 0.016). Maternal preference for getting young children vaccinated was >95% at baseline and did not change. The hPLA intervention improved the adjusted maternal/caregiver knowledge score by 7.9 points (maximum possible score 21) compared to the control (95% CI 6.93, 8.85; p < 0.0001). Coverage of both measles vaccination (MCV1) (aOR 2.43 95% CI 1.96, 3.01; p < 0.001) and completion of the pentavalent vaccination series (aOR 2.45 95% CI 1.27, 4.74; p = 0.008) also improved. However, adherence to timely vaccination did not (aOR 1.12 95% CI 0.39, 3.26; p = 0.828). Possession of a home-based, child health record card increased in the intervention arm from 18 to 35% (aOR 2.86 95% CI 1.35, 6.06; p = 0.006).
Conclusion
A hPLA approach, run in partnership with indigenous social groups, can achieve important changes in public health knowledge and practice in a humanitarian context. Further work to scale up the approach and address other vaccines and population groups is warranted.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on mental health symptoms and quality of life (QoL) in the general population due to necessary public health restrictions such as social distancing. The psychosocial effect of the pandemic on vulnerable groups such as people living with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) has been scarcely explored in countries with additional socioeconomical burdens such as access to healthcare disparities
Methods
A questionnaire exploring sociodemographic variables, quality of life, mental health determinants and sleep quality was applied to 92 PwMS to explore changes prior and during the pandemic regarding these domains
Results
58.8% of the subjects were female, median age was 37.1 (± 8.5) years and relapsing-remitting MS was the predominant clinical subtype (83.5%). Unemployment rate significantly increased during the pandemic (12.3% vs 27.8%; p= 0.001). Only 46.4% received medical follow-up care during the pandemic. QoL was affected predominantly due to limitations in instrumented activities of daily life (IADL). Neuropsychiatric symptoms, requiring healthcare during the pandemic, anxiety prior to the pandemic and restricted IADL were predictors of MS-related physical impact worsening, while decreased physical/emotional wellbeing selfcare, neuropsychiatric symptoms, bad sleep quality, anxiety prior to the pandemic and restricted non-instrumental ADL predicted aggravation of MS-related psychological impact measured by the MSIS-29. Curiously, specific items regarding anxiety were more prevalent prior to the pandemic (anxious mood; p=0.02, helplessness; p=0.01), sleep problems; p=0.001 and cardiovascular symptoms; p=0.001, nevertheless, stability was observed for most items. Importantly, 77.3% of PwMS reported at least one neuropsychiatric symptom
Conclusion
The deleterious effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychosocial wellbeing in PwMS, QoL and mental health outcomes are frequently overseen in vulnerable populations such as PwMS. Albeit the limitations of this study, our results may help implement policies that prevent negative outcomes on psychosocial wellbeing due to public health measures (e.g., social distancing) in MS and other neurological diseases that inexorably need constant follow-up.

AB  - Summary
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically perturbed the epidemiology of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) respiratory tract infections in children. The reasons for this are not clear. In this article, we review the current literature and critically discuss the different theories to explain why the epidemiology of RSV has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed mechanisms include decreased viral immunity in vulnerable age groups caused by the prolonged lack of RSV circulation early in the pandemic, potential Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced immune dysregulation, viral interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, and modifications in health-seeking behaviors as well as heath systems factors. Research in viral genomics and phylogeny, and more robust immunology research is needed to guide RSV prevention and health care resource planning.

AB  - Objectives
The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic declared by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 impacted healthcare services with provider and patient cancellations, delays, and patient avoidance or delay of emergency department or urgent care. Limited data exist on the population proportion affected by delayed healthcare, which is important for future healthcare planning efforts. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare service cancellations or delays and delays/avoidance of emergency/urgent care overall and by population characteristics.
Study design
This was a cross-sectional study.
Methods
Our sample (n = 2314) was assembled through a phone survey from 8/12/2020–10/27/2020 among non-institutionalized St. Louis County, Missouri, USA residents ≥18 years. We asked about provider and patient-initiated cancellations or delays of appointments and pandemic-associated delays/avoidance of emergency/urgent care overall and by participant characteristics. We calculated weighted prevalence estimates by select resident characteristics.
Results
Healthcare services cancellations or delays affected ∼54% (95% CI 50.6%–57.1%) of residents with dental (31.1%, 95% CI 28.1%–34.0%) and primary care (22.1%, 95% CI 19.5%–24.6%) being most common. The highest prevalences were among those who were White, ≥65 years old, female, in fair/poor health, who had health insurance, and who had ≥1 medical condition. Delayed or avoided emergency/urgent care impacted ∼23% (95% CI 19.9%–25.4%) of residents with a higher prevalence in females than males.
Conclusions
Healthcare use disruptions impacted a substantial proportion of residents. Future healthcare planning efforts should consider these data to minimize potential morbidity and mortality from delayed care.

KW  - COVID-19 Demographic Risk Factors
AB  - The assessment of hospitalisations and intensive care is crucial for planning health care resources needed over the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nonetheless, comparative empirical assessments of COVID-19 hospitalisations and related fatality risk patterns on a large scale are lacking. This paper exploits anonymised, individual-level data on SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infections collected and harmonized by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to profile the demographics of COVID-19 hospitalised patients across nine European countries during the first pandemic wave (February – June 2020). We estimate the role of demographic factors for the risk of in-hospital mortality, and present a case study exploring individuals’ comorbidities based on a subset of COVID-19 hospitalised patients available from the Dutch health system. We find that hospitalisation rates are highest among individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who are not only older than 70 years, but also 50-69 years. The latter group has a longer median time between COVID-19 symptoms’ onset and hospitalisation than those aged 70+ years. Men have higher hospitalisation rates than women at all ages, and particularly above age 50. Consistently, men aged 50-59 years have a probability of hospitalisation almost double than women do. Although the gender imbalance in hospitalisation remains above age 70, the gap between men and women narrows at older ages. Comorbidities play a key role in explaining selection effects of COVID-19 confirmed positive cases requiring hospitalisation. Our study contributes to the evaluation of the COVID-19 burden on the demand of health-care during emergency phases. Assessing intensity and timing dimensions of hospital admissions, our findings allow for a better understanding of COVID-19 severe outcomes. Results point to the need of suitable calibrations of epidemiological projections and (re)planning of health services, enhancing preparedness to deal with infectious disease outbreaks.

AB  - In this perspective, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on tuberculosis (TB)/HIV health services and approaches to mitigating the growing burden of these three colliding epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). SSA countries bear significantly high proportions of TB and HIV cases reported worldwide, compared to countries in the West. Whilst COVID-19 epidemiology appears to vary across Africa, most countries in this region have reported relatively lower-case counts compared to the West. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has added an additional burden to already overstretched health systems in SSA, which, among other things, have been focused on the longstanding dual epidemics of TB and HIV. As with these dual epidemics, inadequate resources and poor case identification and reporting may be contributing to underestimations of the COVID-19 case burden in SSA. Modelling studies predict that the pandemic-related disruptions in TB and HIV services will result in significant increases in associated morbidity and mortality over the next five years. Furthermore, limited empirical evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 coinfections with TB and HIV are associated with increased mortality risk in SSA. However, predictive models require a better evidence-base to accurately define the impact of COVID-19, not only on communicable diseases such as TB and HIV, but on non-communicable disease comorbidities. Further research is needed to assess morbidity and mortality data among both adults and children across the African continent, paying attention to geographic disparities, as well as the clinical and socio-economic determinants of COVID-19 in the setting of TB and/or HIV.

AB  - More than 700 million confirmed cases of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) have been reported globally, and 10–60% of patients are expected to exhibit “post-COVID-19 symptoms,” which will continue to affect human life and health. In the absence of safer, more specific drugs, current multiple immunotherapies have failed to achieve satisfactory efficacy. Ginseng, a traditional Chinese medicine, is often used as an immunomodulator and has been used in COVID-19 treatment as a tonic to increase blood oxygen saturation. Ginsenosides are the main active components of ginseng. In this review, we summarize the multiple ways in which ginsenosides affect post-COVID-19 symptoms, including inhibition of lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor signaling, modulation of chemokine receptors and inflammasome activation, induction of macrophage polarization, effects on Toll-like receptors, nuclear factor kappa-B, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, lymphocytes, intestinal flora, and epigenetic regulation. Ginsenosides affect virus-mediated tissue damage, local or systemic inflammation, immune modulation, and other links, thus alleviating respiratory and pulmonary symptoms, reducing the cardiac burden, protecting the nervous system, and providing new ideas for the rehabilitation of patients with post-COVID-19 symptoms. Furthermore, we analyzed its role in strengthening body resistance to eliminate pathogenic factors from the perspective of ginseng-epidemic disease and highlighted the challenges in clinical applications. However, the benefit of ginsenosides in modulating organismal imbalance post-COVID-19 needs to be further evaluated to better validate the pharmacological mechanisms associated with their traditional efficacy and to determine their role in individualized therapy.

AB  - Aims
In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple suggestions have been delivered through websites and social media referring to natural substances and various kinds of supplements with thaumaturgical properties in preventing and/or fighting the coronavirus infection. Indeed, there is no clinical trial evidence that a dietary or pharmacological supplementation of any particular substance will increase the effectiveness of the immune defences. There are however three nutritional issues that deserve special attention under the present circumstances, namely vitamin D deficiency, excess salt intake and inappropriate alcohol consumption. Here is a short review of the current knowledge about the possible role of these factors in the immunity defence system and their potential impact on the modulation of the immune response to SARS-COV2 infection.
Data synthesis
For all of these factors there is convincing evidence of an impact on the immune defence structure and function. In the absence of RCT demonstration that increased ingestion of any given substance may confer protection against the new enemy, special attention to correction of these three nutritional criticisms is certainly warranted at the time of COVID pandemic.
Conclusions
We propose that the inappropriate intake of salt and alcohol and the risk of inadequate vitamin D status should be object of screening, in particular in subjects at high mortality risk from SARS-COV 2 infection, such as institutionalised elderly subjects and all those affected by predisposing conditions.

AB  - Summary
Background
We aimed to evaluate the use of baricitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) 1–2 inhibitor, for the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.
Methods
This randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), is assessing multiple possible treatments in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone (usual care group) or usual care plus baricitinib 4 mg once daily by mouth for 10 days or until discharge if sooner (baricitinib group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed in the intention-to-treat population. A meta-analysis was done, which included the results from the RECOVERY trial and all previous randomised controlled trials of baricitinib or other JAK inhibitor in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. The RECOVERY trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04381936) and is ongoing.
Findings
Between Feb 2 and Dec 29, 2021, from 10 852 enrolled, 8156 patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus baricitinib versus usual care alone. At randomisation, 95% of patients were receiving corticosteroids and 23% were receiving tocilizumab (with planned use within the next 24 h recorded for a further 9%). Overall, 514 (12%) of 4148 patients allocated to baricitinib versus 546 (14%) of 4008 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (age-adjusted rate ratio 0·87; 95% CI 0·77–0·99; p=0·028). This 13% proportional reduction in mortality was somewhat smaller than that seen in a meta-analysis of eight previous trials of a JAK inhibitor (involving 3732 patients and 425 deaths), in which allocation to a JAK inhibitor was associated with a 43% proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0·57; 95% CI 0·45–0·72). Including the results from RECOVERY in an updated meta-analysis of all nine completed trials (involving 11 888 randomly assigned patients and 1485 deaths) allocation to baricitinib or another JAK inhibitor was associated with a 20% proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0·80; 95% CI 0·72–0·89; p<0·0001). In RECOVERY, there was no significant excess in death or infection due to non-COVID-19 causes and no significant excess of thrombosis, or other safety outcomes.
Interpretation
In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, baricitinib significantly reduced the risk of death but the size of benefit was somewhat smaller than that suggested by previous trials. The total randomised evidence to date suggests that JAK inhibitors (chiefly baricitinib) reduce mortality in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 by about one-fifth.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, may result in multi-system pathology associated with the failure of multiple organ systems. The disease primarily manifests as a mild respiratory illness, however a minority of patients may progress to severe disease, with pneumonia, respiratory failure, and hyperinflammatory syndromes increasing mortality. This article explores the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and presents the management of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Along with acute illness, the chapter looks at post-COVID sequelae, considers recovery from illness, and offers consideration for the disease into the future.

AB  - Background
The indicators of the pandemic have been based on the total number of diagnosed cases of COVID-19, the number of people hospitalized or in intensive care units, and deaths from the infection. The aim of this study is to describe the available data on diagnostic tests, health service used for the diagnosis of COVID-19, case detection and monitoring.
Method
Descriptive study with review of official data available on the websites of the Spanish health councils corresponding to 17 Autonomous Communities, 2 Autonomous cities and the Ministry of Health. The variables collected refer to contact tracing, technics for diagnosis, use of health services and follow-up.
Results
All regions of Spain show data on diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and deaths. Hospitalized cases and intensive care admissions are shown in all regions except the Balearic Islands. Diagnostic tests for COVID-19 have been registered in all regions except Madrid region and Extremadura, with scarcely information on what type of test has been performed (present in 7 CCAA), requesting service and study of contacts.
Conclusions
The information available on the official websites of the Health Departments of the different regions of Spain are heterogeneous. Data from the use of health service or workload in Primary Care, Emergency department or Out of hours services are almost non-existent.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 has rapidly spread across the globe. Critical to the control of COVID-19 is the characterisation of its epidemiology. Despite this, there has been a paucity of evidence from many parts of the world, including Malaysia. We aim to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Malaysia to inform prevention and control policies better.
Methods
Malaysian COVID-19 data was extracted from 16 March 2020 up to 31 May 2021. We estimated the following epidemiological indicators: 7-day incidence rates, 7-day mortality rates, case fatality rates, test positive ratios, testing rates and the time-varying reproduction number (Rt).
Findings
Between 16 March 2020 and 31 May 2021, Malaysia has reported 571,901 cases and 2,796 deaths. Malaysia's average 7-day incidence rate was 26•6 reported infections per 100,000 population (95% CI: 17•8, 38•1). The average test positive ratio and testing rate were 4•3% (95% CI: 1•6, 10•2) and 0•8 tests per 1,000 population (95% CI: <0•1, 3•7), respectively. The case fatality rates (CFR) was 0•6% (95% CI: <0•1, 3•7). Among the 2,796 cases who died, 87•3% were ≥ 50 years.
Interpretation
The public health response was successful in the suppression of COVID-19 transmission or the first half of 2020. However, a state election and outbreaks in institutionalised populations have been the catalyst for more significant community propagation. This rising community transmission has continued in 2021, leading to increased incidence and strained healthcare systems. Calibrating NPI based on epidemiological indicators remain critical for us to live with the virus. (243 words)

AB  - Background
Previous studies evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine safety or compared adverse events following vaccination to those from infection. Limited data about the impact of prior infection on post-vaccine adverse events are available. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on outcomes shortly after vaccination using a longitudinal design.
Methods
Nationwide, multicenter, retrospective cohort study of hospitalization, death, and pre-specified adverse event rates among Veterans who received mRNA vaccines within the Veterans Health Administration between 12/11/2020 and 8/31/2021. Daily incidence rates were compared before and after vaccine doses, stratified by history of microbiologically-confirmed SARS-CoV-2.
Results
3,118,802 patients received a first dose and 2,979,326 a second, including 102,829 with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Daily incident hospitalization rates were unchanged before and after the second dose among patients without previous infection (28.8/100,000 post-dose versus 28.6/100,000 pre-dose, p = 0.92). In previously-infected patients, the hospitalization rate increased above baseline one day following vaccination (158.2/100,000 after dose 2 versus 57.3/100,000 pre-dose, p < 0.001), then returned to baseline. Chart review indicated vaccine side effects, such as fever, constitutional symptoms, weakness, or falls, as the definite (39%) or possible (18%) cause of hospitalization. Affected patients had mean age 75, and 90% had at least one serious comorbidity. Hospitalizations were brief (median 2 days), with rapid return to baseline health. Worse baseline health among previously-infected patients prevented conclusions about mortality risk.
Conclusions
Two-dose mRNA vaccine regimens are safe in a population with many comorbidities. Transient increased risks of hospitalization were identified among patients with prior SARS-CoV-2, absolute risk ∼1:1000. Findings support additional study regarding the optimal dosing schedule in this population.
Funding

Exploiting detailed geographical variation within countries, we show that a one-standard-deviation increase in social capital leads to between 14% and 34% fewer Covid-19 cases per capita accumulated from mid-March until end of June 2020, as well as between 6% and 35% fewer excess deaths per capita. Our results highlight the positive health returns of strengthening social capital.

AB  - We present a new concept, Punt Politics, and apply it to the COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) in two epicenters of the pandemic: Mexico and Brazil. Punt Politics refers to national leaders in federal systems deferring or deflecting responsibility for health systems decision-making to sub-national entities without evidence or coordination. The fragmentation of authority and overlapping functions in federal, decentralized political systems make them more susceptible to coordination problems than centralized, unitary systems. We apply the concept to pandemics, which require national health system stewardship, using sub-national NPI data that we developed and curated through the Observatory for the Containment of COVID-19 in the Americas to illustrate Punt Politics in Mexico and Brazil. Both countries suffer from protracted, high levels of COVID-19 mortality and inadequate pandemic responses, including little testing and disregard for scientific evidence. We illustrate how populist leadership drove Punt Politics and how partisan politics contributed to disabling an evidence-based response in Mexico and Brazil. These cases illustrate the combination of decentralization and populist leadership that is most conducive to punting responsibility. We discuss how Punt Politics reduces health system functionality, providing lessons for other countries and future pandemic responses, including vaccine rollout.

AB  - Racial and ethnic-related health disparities in the United States have been intensified by the greater burden of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in racial and ethnic minority populations. Compared to non-Hispanic White individuals, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx individuals infected by COVID-19 are at greater risk for hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and death. There are several factors that may contribute to disparities in COVID-19-related severity and outcomes in these minority populations, including the greater burden of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases as discussed in our companion review article. Social determinants of health are a critical, yet often overlooked, contributor to racial and ethnic-related health disparities in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx individuals relative to non-Hispanic White individuals. Thus, the purpose of this review is to focus on the essential role of social factors in contributing to health disparities in chronic diseases and COVID-19 outcomes in minority populations. Herein, we begin by focusing on structural racism as a social determinant of health at the societal level that contributes to health disparities through downstream social level (e.g., occupation and residential conditions) and individual level health behaviors (e.g., nutrition, physical activity, and sleep). Lastly, we conclude with a discussion of practical applications and recommendations for future research and public health efforts that seek to reduce health disparities and overall disease burden.

AB  - Background
Differences in routinely collected biomarkers between ethnic groups could reflect dysregulated host responses to disease and to treatments, and be associated with excess morbidity and mortality in COVID-19.
Methods
A multicentre registry analysis from patients aged ≥16 yr with SARS-CoV-2 infection and emergency admission to Barts Health NHS Trust hospitals during January 1, 2020 to May 13, 2020 (wave 1) and September 1, 2020 to February 17, 2021 (wave 2) was subjected to unsupervised longitudinal clustering techniques to identify distinct phenotypic patient clusters based on trajectories of routine blood results over the first 15 days of hospital admission. Distribution of trajectory clusters across ethnic categories was determined, and associations between ethnicity, trajectory clusters, and 30-day survival were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards modelling. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission, survival to hospital discharge, and long-term survival to 640 days.
Results
We included 3237 patients with hospital length of stay ≥7 days. In patients who died, there was greater representation of Black and Asian ethnicity in trajectory clusters for C-reactive protein and urea-to-creatinine ratio associated with increased risk of death. Inclusion of trajectory clusters in survival analyses attenuated or abrogated the higher risk of death in Asian and Black patients. Inclusion of C-reactive protein went from hazard ratio (HR) 1.36 [0.95–1.94] to HR 0.97 [0.59–1.59] (wave 1), and from HR 1.42 [1.15–1.75]) to HR 1.04 [0.78–1.39] (wave 2) in Asian patients. Trajectory clusters associated with reduced 30-day survival were similarly associated with worse secondary outcomes.
Conclusions
Clinical biochemical monitoring of COVID-19 and progression and treatment response in SARS-CoV-2 infection should be interpreted in the context of ethnic background.

AB  - Objective
This study examines the factors influencing vaccination rollout and its effectiveness in reducing infectious disease outbreaks in African countries. It aims to understand why some countries performed better in vaccination coverage than others and explores the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations in conjunction with the stringency index in Africa.
Methods
Two data sources were utilized. Firstly, a scoping review of relevant studies and gray literature was conducted using the Arksey H & O'Malley L methodological framework. Additionally, data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT dataset) were analysed to explore the effect of COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. Regression discontinuity in time was employed to assess the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on new COVID-19 cases, deaths, and reproduction rate.
Results
The study found that the number of vaccinated individuals increased from March 2021, while the stringency index steadily declined since January 2021. Despite higher vaccination coverage, new COVID-19 cases and deaths peaked in late 2021 and early 2022, indicating the continued need for non-pharmaceutical interventions. After considering country fixed effects and other covariates, the number of new cases and deaths were negatively associated with the stringency index and vaccine introduction.
Conclusion
COVID-19 vaccination was shown to be crucial in reducing new cases and deaths in Africa. However, vaccination progress in the region remains low and is influenced by factors at both structural and micro levels. Further research is required to disentangle the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions and other measures from vaccination campaigns in the context of Africa while accounting for other contributing factors.
Lay summary
This study aimed to understand why some African countries did better than others in their COVID-19 vaccination efforts and how these vaccinations affected the spread of the virus. Researchers reviewed existing studies and government data along with the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. While vaccinations increased from March 2021 and strict measures eased from January 2021, new cases and deaths remained high in late 2021 and early 2022, indicating the need for additional measures. Stricter government actions and higher vaccination rates were linked to fewer cases and deaths. In Africa, COVID-19 vaccinations are crucial, but progress is slow due to various factors at both macro and individual levels. Further research is required to understand the interplay between vaccinations, other measures, and controlling the virus.

AB  - Acute cardiac manifestions of COVID-19 have been well described, while chronic cardiac sequelae remain less clear. Various studies have shown conflicting data on the prevalence of new or worsening cardiovascular disease, myocarditis or cardiac dysrhythmias among patients recovered from COVID-19. Data are emerging that show that patients recovering from COVID-19 have an increased incidence of myocarditis and arrhythmias after recovery from COVID-19 compared with the control groups without COVID-19. The incidence of myocarditis after COVID-19 infection is low but is still significantly greater than the incidence of myocarditis from a COVID-19 vaccine. There have been several studies of athletes who underwent a variety of screening protocols prior to being cleared to return to exercise and competition. The data show possible, probable or definite myocarditis or cardiac injury among 0.4–3.0% of the athletes studied. Recent consensus statements suggest that athletes with full recovery and absence of cardiopulmonary symptoms may return to exercise and competition without cardiovascular testing. In conclusion, patients with COVID-19 may be expected to have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, myocarditis or arrhythmias during the convalescent phase. Fortunately, the majority of patients, including athletes may return to their normal activity after recovery from COVID 19, in the absence of persisting cardiovascular symptoms.

AB  - Crisis-induced vaccine supply chain management has recently drawn attention to the importance of immediate responses to a crisis (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic). This study develops a queuing model for a crisis-induced vaccine supply chain to ensure efficient coordination and distribution of different COVID-19 vaccine types to people with various levels of vulnerability. We define a utility function for queues to study the changes in arrival rates related to the inventory level of vaccines, the efficiency of vaccines, and a risk aversion coefficient for vaccinees. A multi-period queuing model considering congestion in the vaccination process is proposed to minimise two contradictory objectives: (i) the expected average wait time of vaccinees and (ii) the total investment in the holding and ordering of vaccines. To develop the bi-objective non-linear programming model, the goal attainment algorithm and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) are employed for small- to large-scale problems. Several solution repairs are also implemented in the classic NSGA-II algorithm to improve its efficiency. Four standard performance metrics are used to investigate the algorithm. The non-parametric Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests are applied on several numerical examples to ensure the privilege of the improved algorithm. The NSGA-II algorithm surveys an authentic case study in Australia, and several scenarios are created to provide insights for an efficient vaccination program.

AB  - Summary
Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection can develop symptoms that persist well beyond the acute phase of COVID-19 or emerge after the acute phase, lasting for weeks or months after the initial acute illness. The post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, which include physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments, are known collectively as long COVID or post-COVID-19 condition. The substantial burden of this multisystem condition is felt at individual, health-care system, and socioeconomic levels, on an unprecedented scale. Survivors of COVID-19-related critical illness are at risk of the well known sequelae of acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and chronic critical illness, and these multidimensional morbidities might be difficult to differentiate from the specific effects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We provide an overview of the manifestations of post-COVID-19 condition after critical illness in adults. We explore the effects on various organ systems, describe potential pathophysiological mechanisms, and consider the challenges of providing clinical care and support for survivors of critical illness with multisystem manifestations. Research is needed to reduce the incidence of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19-related critical illness and to optimise therapeutic and rehabilitative care and support for patients.

Throughout the first two years of the pandemic, there has been a concerted effort to improve our understanding of the within-host immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus to provide better predictions of COVID-19 severity, treatment and vaccine development questions, and insights into viral evolution and the impacts of variants on immunopathology. Here we provide perspectives on what has been accomplished using quantitative methods, including predictive modelling, population genetics, machine learning, and dimensionality reduction techniques, in the first 26 months of the COVID-19 pandemic approaches, and where we go from here to improve our responses to this and future pandemics.

AB  - Objectives
There emerges increasing doubt regarding whether the policy composite indicators are applicable to the COVID-19 pandemic. A few early studies demonstrate that the association between some composite indicators of policy preparedness and the risk of COVID-19 is statistically insignificant, and the relation between any composite indicators and recovery process (e.g., vaccination coverage) remains unexplored. To examine the relation between composite indicators and pandemic risk (as well as the vaccination coverage) with robustness, this study applies different policy preparedness indicators by using data from multi-sources.
Study design
A cross-sectional analysis was performed.
Method
Regression analysis is adopted to examine the relation between four policy preparedness indicators (i.e., [1] International Health Regulations core capacity index, [2] Global Health Security Index, [3] epidemic preparedness index, and [4] World Governance Index) and COVID-19-confirmed cases/death/vaccination coverage at different time points. The linear regression is performed, and the spatial distribution of indicators are illustrated.
Results
Countries with higher ranking in policy preparedness indexes can experience less severity of pandemic risk (e.g., confirmed cases and mortality) and faster recovery process (e.g., higher vaccination coverage). However, slight disparity in effectiveness exists across different indicators.
Conclusion
Results show that the policy preparedness indicators have predictive value of the confirmed cases, mortality, and vaccination coverage of COVID-19 pandemic, given sufficiently long-time span is observed.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded pathologists of our significant roles in the management and understanding of rapidly spreading and dangerous pathogens, from identifying the agent to characterizing the clinical pathology to managing the dead. Cellular pathology – through autopsy - has depicted the main features: viral pneumonitis, acute lung injury, organising pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, thrombophilia and infarction, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome with multi-organ failure. These are similar to another viral pandemic of the 20th century, H1N1 influenza; but contrast with the second major more complicated pandemic, that of HIV/AIDS. The outcomes of these infections are compared, along with seasonal influenza and SARS-1-CoV disease. Work to be done on COVID-19 includes characterisation of the emerging ‘long COVID’ syndrome, and monitoring the complications of therapies and vaccination programs.

AB  - Summary
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has strained health system capacity worldwide due to a surge of hospital admissions, while mitigation measures have simultaneously reduced patients' access to health care, affecting the diagnosis and treatment of other diseases such as cancer. We estimated the impact of delayed diagnosis on cancer outcomes in Chile using a novel modelling approach to inform policies and planning to mitigate the forthcoming cancer-related health impacts of the pandemic in Chile.
Methods
We developed a microsimulation model of five cancers in Chile (breast, cervix, colorectal, prostate, and stomach) for which reliable data were available, which simulates cancer incidence and progression in a nationally representative virtual population, as well as stage-specific cancer detection and survival probabilities. We calibrated the model to empirical data on monthly detected cases, as well as stage at diagnosis and 5-year net survival. We accounted for the impact of COVID-19 on excess mortality and cancer detection by month during the pandemic, and projected diagnosed cancer cases and outcomes of stage at diagnosis and survival up to 2030. For comparison, we simulated a no COVID-19 scenario in which the impacts of COVID-19 on excess mortality and cancer detection were removed.
Findings
Our modelling showed a sharp decrease in the number of diagnosed cancer cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a large projected short-term increase in future diagnosed cases. Due to the projected backlog in diagnosis, we estimated that in 2021 there will be an extra 3198 cases (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1356–5017) diagnosed among the five modelled cancers, an increase of nearly 14% compared with the no COVID-19 scenario, falling to a projected 10% increase in 2022 with 2674 extra cases (1318–4032) diagnosed. As a result of delayed diagnosis, we found a worse stage distribution for detected cancers in 2020–22, which is estimated to lead to 3542 excess cancer deaths (95% UI 2236–4816) in 2022–30, compared with the no COVID-19 scenario, among the five modelled cancers, most of which (3299 deaths, 2151–4431) are projected to occur before 2025.
Interpretation
In addition to a large projected surge in diagnosed cancer cases, we found that delays in diagnosis will result in worse cancer stage at presentation, leading to worse survival outcomes. These findings can help to inform surge capacity planning and highlight the importance of ensuring appropriate health system capacity levels to detect and care for the increased cancer cases in the coming years, while maintaining the timeliness and quality of cancer care. Potential delays in treatment and adverse impacts on quality of care, which were not considered in this model, are likely to contribute to even more excess deaths from cancer than projected.

AB  - Objectives
This paper describes the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, including policies to reduce the health-related and economic consequences. The Netherlands started with containment and shifted to mitigation within three weeks when implementing a ‘mild’ lockdown. The initial focus was to obtain herd immunity while preventing Intensive Care Units from getting overwhelmed.
Methods
An in-depth analysis of available national and international COVID-19 data sources was conducted. Due to regional variation in COVID-19 hospitalization rates, this paper focuses on three distinct regions; the initial epicenter; the most northern provinces which – contrary to national policy – decided not to switch to mitigation; and the Bible Belt, as congregations of religious groups were initially excluded from the ban on group formation.
Results
On August 11th, 6,159 COVID-19 deaths were reported with at the peak an excess mortality Z-score of 21.7. As a result of the pandemic, the economy took a severe hit and is predicted to shrink 6.5% compared to projection. The hospitalization rates in the northern regions were over 70% lower compared to the rest of the country (18 versus 66 per 100,000 inhabitants). Differences between the Bible Belt and the rest of the country were hardly detectable.
Conclusion
The Dutch have shown a way to effectively slow down transmission while allowing more personal and economic freedom than most other countries. Furthermore, the regional differences suggest that containment prevented a surge of infections in the northern provinces. The results should be interpreted with caution, due to the descriptive nature of this study.

AB  - Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic created a unique opportunity to study the effects of infection and vaccination on disease. The year 2020 was dominated by infection and its consequences. The year 2021 was dominated by vaccination and its consequences. It will still take several years for full maturation of databases required for robust epidemiological studies. Therefore, this review on the implications for neuro-ophthalmology draws on resources presently available including reported adverse reactions to vaccination. Illustrative clinical cases are presented. The spectrum of pathology following infection with SARS-CoV-2 falls into 4 main categories: autoimmune, vascular, sequelae of brain damage, and miscellaneous. This review is exhaustive, but the most common conditions discussed relate to headaches and associated symptoms; vertigo, diplopia, and nystagmus; vascular complications of the eye and brain; cranial nerve (mono-)neuropathies; photophobia, ocular discomfort, and optic neuritis. Of the 36 main adverse reactions reviewed, vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia is a novel complication requiring specific hematological management. Updated diagnostic criteria are summarized. It is relevant to remember taking a medication history because of side effects and to recognize the relevance of comorbidities. The clinical assessment can frequently be performed virtually. Consensus recommendations on telemedicine and the virtual assessment are summarized in a practical and compressed format. The review concludes with an epidemiological tetralogy to interrogate, in future studies, associations with (1) SARS-CoV-2 pandemic infection, (2) SARS-CoV-2 worldwide vaccination, and (3) the possibility of a rebound effect of infections in the pandemic aftermath.

AB  - Summary
Background
COVID-19 has affected the African region in many ways. We aimed to generate robust information on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in this region since the beginning of the pandemic and throughout 2022.
Methods
For each of the 47 countries of the WHO African region, we consolidated COVID-19 data from reported infections and deaths (from WHO statistics); published literature on socioecological, biophysical, and public health interventions; and immunity status and variants of concern, to build a dynamic and comprehensive picture of COVID-19 burden. The model is consolidated through a partially observed Markov decision process, with a Fourier series to produce observed patterns over time based on the SEIRD (denoting susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, and dead) modelling framework. The model was set up to run weekly, by country, from the date the first infection was reported in each country until Dec 31, 2021. New variants were introduced into the model based on sequenced data reported by countries. The models were then extrapolated until the end of 2022 and included three scenarios based on possible new variants with varying transmissibility, severity, or immunogenicity.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 2020, and Dec 31, 2021, our model estimates the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the African region to be 505·6 million (95% CI 476·0–536·2), inferring that only 1·4% (one in 71) of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the region were reported. Deaths are estimated at 439 500 (95% CI 344 374–574 785), with 35·3% (one in three) of these reported as COVID-19-related deaths. Although the number of infections were similar between 2020 and 2021, 81% of the deaths were in 2021. 52·3% (95% CI 43·5–95·2) of the region's population is estimated to have some SARS-CoV-2 immunity, given vaccination coverage of 14·7% as of Dec 31, 2021. By the end of 2022, we estimate that infections will remain high, at around 166·2 million (95% CI 157·5–174·9) infections, but deaths will substantially reduce to 22 563 (14 970–38 831).
Interpretation
The African region is estimated to have had a similar number of COVID-19 infections to that of the rest of the world, but with fewer deaths. Our model suggests that the current approach to SARS-CoV-2 testing is missing most infections. These results are consistent with findings from representative seroprevalence studies. There is, therefore, a need for surveillance of hospitalisations, comorbidities, and the emergence of new variants of concern, and scale-up of representative seroprevalence studies, as core response strategies.

AB  - To respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments frequently resorted to declaring the state of emergency, fuelling contestations over the abuse of public powers and effectiveness of the measures to induce compliance. This article examines how the denial of the political nature of emergency governance known as depoliticisation undermines government credibility and may suit anti-democratic actors. We contribute to understanding the relationship between depoliticisation and democracy by showing how Slovak coalition parties during key parliamentary debates on the state of emergency during the COVID-19 pandemic insisted on depoliticising the pandemic while parliamentary opposition parties with anti-democratic leanings successfully opted for its repoliticisation. Repoliticising a key decision on managing the public health emergency granted credibility to illiberal political actors at the expense of the government, cautioning against depoliticisation strategies to be invoked by democrats in fragile democracies. Instead, accepting that such decisions are political may prevent the loss of credibility due to unsuccessful rhetorical practices of depoliticisation.

AB  - Introduction
The COVID19 pandemic had a strong impact on the healthcare system, particularly in oncology. Brain tumor are usually revealed by acute and life threatening symptoms. We wanted to evaluate the possible consequences of the COVID19 pandemic in 2020 on the activity of neuro-oncology multidisciplinary tumor board in a Normandy region (France).
Methods
A descriptive, retrospective, multicenter study was conducted in the four referent centers (two universitary hospitals and two cancer centers). The main objective was to compare the average number of neuro-oncology patients presented per multidisciplinary tumor board per week between a pre-COVID19 reference period (period 1 from December 2018 to December 2019) and the pre-vaccination period (period 2 from December 2019 to November 2020).
Results
Across Normandy, 1540 cases were presented in neuro-oncology multidisciplinary tumor board in 2019 and 2020. No difference was observed between period 1 and 2: respectively 9.8 per week versus 10.7, P=0.36. The number of cases per week also did not significantly differ during the lockdown periods: 9.1/week versus 10.4 during the non-lockdown periods, P=0.26. The only difference observed was a higher proportion of tumor resection during the lockdown periods: 81.4% (n=79/174) versus 64.5% (n=408/1366), P=0.001.
Conclusion
The pre-vaccination era of the COVID19 pandemic did not impact the activity of neuro-oncology multidisciplinary tumor board in the Normandy region. The possible consequences in terms of public health (excess mortality) due to this tumor location should now be investigated.

In this paper, we first extend the SIR model by introducing two new status. We calibrate the model by 2022 Shanghai COVID-19 outbreak. The results shows compared to zero-constraint policy, under our control policy, 50 % more life can be saved at the cost of 2.13 % loss of consumptions. Our results also emphasize the importance of the dynamic nature and the timing of control policy, either a static pandemic control or a lagged pandemic control damages badly to people's livelihood and social productions. Counter factual experiments show that compared to the baseline, when a persistent high-strength control is applied, aggregate productions decreases by 57 %; when pandemic control ends too early, the death would rise by 15 %, when pandemic control starts too late, the death rises by 23 % and aggregate productions decreases by 13 %.

AB  - Background
Few studies have analyzed the incidence and the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the post-acute phase of COVID-19 infection.
Objective
To assess the incidence and risk of AMI in COVID-19 survivors after SARS-CoV-2 infection by a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data.
Methods
Data were obtained searching MEDLINE and Scopus for all studies published at any time up to September 1, 2022 and reporting the risk of incident AMI in patients recovered from COVID-19 infection. AMI risk was evaluated using the Mantel–Haenszel random effects models with Hazard ratio (HR) as the effect measure with 95% confidence interval (CI) while heterogeneity was assessed using Higgins and Thomson I2 statistic.
Results
Among 2765 articles obtained by our search strategy, four studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria for a total of 20,875,843 patients (mean age 56.1 years, 59.1% males). Of them, 1,244,604 had COVID-19 infection. Over a mean follow-up of 8.5 months, among COVID-19 recovered patients AMI occurred in 3.5 cases per 1.000 individuals compared to 2.02 cases per 1.000 individuals in the control cohort, defined as those who did not experience COVID-19 infection in the same period). COVID-19 patients showed an increased risk of incident AMI (HR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.65–2.26, p < 0.0001, I2 = 83.5%). Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that the risk of AMI was directly associated with age (p = 0.01) and male gender (p = 0.001), while an indirect relationship was observed when the length of follow-up was utilized as moderator (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
COVID-19 recovered patients had an increased risk of AMI.

AB  - Background
Among hospitalized US Veterans, the rate of non-ventilator associated hospital acquired pneumonia (NV-HAP) decreased between 2015 and 2020 then increased following the onset of 2019-nCoV (COVID-19).
Methods
Veterans admitted to inpatient acute care for ≥48 hours at 135 Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers between 2015 and 2021 were identified (n = 1,567,275). Non-linear trends in NV-HAP incidence were estimated using generalized additive modeling, adjusted for seasonality and patient risk factors.
Results
The incidence rate (IR) of NV-HAP decreased linearly by 32% (95% CI: 63-74) from 10/1/2015 to 2/1/2020, translating to 337 fewer NV-HAP cases. Following the US onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in February 2020, the NV-HAP IR increased by 25% (95% CI: 14-36) among Veterans without COVID-19 and 108% (95% CI: 178-245) among Veterans with COVID-19, resulting in an additional 50 NV-HAP cases and $5,042,900 in direct patient care costs 12-months post admission.
Discussion
This increase in NV-HAP rates could be driven by elevated risk among Veterans with COVID-19, decreased prevention measures during extreme COVID-19 related system stress, and increased patient acuity among hospitalized Veterans during the first year of the pandemic.
Conclusions
Basic nursing preventive measures that are resilient to system stress are needed as well as population surveillance to rapidly identify changes in NV-HAP risk.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected >610 million people globally, exerting major social, economic, and health impacts. Despite the large number of global casualities and severe symptomatology associated with COVID-19, a large number of individuals remain at elevated risk of infection and severe outcomes related to poor lifestyle behaviors and/or associated comorbidities. Beyond the well-known social distance and masking policies, maintaining an active lifestyle, minimizing the consumption of tobacco products, and maintaining an adequate nutrition status are some of the key factors that, in an affordable and accessible way, have the potential to improve health and minimize COVID-19 impact. In addition, bringing awareness of the higher risks and poor prognosis of COVID-19 when other conditions are present seems to be essential to protect those individuals with the highest risks.

AB  - Background
Health conditions, immune dysfunction, and premature aging associated with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome, DS) may impact the clinical course of COVID-19.
Methods
The T21RS COVID-19 Initiative launched an international survey for clinicians or caregivers on patients with COVID-19 and DS. Data collected between April and October 2020 (N=1046) were analysed and compared with the UK ISARIC4C survey of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without DS.
Findings
The mean age of COVID-19 patients with DS in the T21RS survey was 29 years (SD = 18). Similar to the general population, the most frequent signs and symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Joint/muscle pain and vomiting or nausea were less frequent (p < 0.01), whereas altered consciousness/confusion were more frequent (p < 0.01). Risk factors for hospitalization and mortality were similar to the general population with the addition of congenital heart defects as a risk factor for hospitalization. Mortality rates showed a rapid increase from age 40 and were higher in patients with DS (T21RS DS versus non-DS patients: risk ratio (RR) = 3.5 (95%-CI=2.6;4.4), ISARIC4C DS versus non-DS patients: RR = 2.9 (95%-CI=2.1;3.8)) even after adjusting for known risk factors for COVID-19 mortality.
Interpretation
Leading signs/symptoms of COVID-19 and risk factors for severe disease course are similar to the general population. However, individuals with DS present significantly higher rates of medical complications and mortality, especially from age 40.

AB  - Objectives
During the pandemic, Switzerland avoided stringent lockdowns and provided funds to stabilize the economy. To assess whether and in what subgroups the pandemic impacted on depressive symptoms in this specific Swiss context, we derived depression trajectories over an extended pandemic period in a Swiss cohort and related them to individuals' sociodemographic characteristics.
Study design
This was a population-based cohort study.
Methods
The population-based COVCO-Basel cohort in North-Western Switzerland invited 112,848 adult residents of whom 12,724 participated at baseline. Between July 2020 and December 2021, 6396 participants answered to additional 18 monthly online questionnaires. Depression symptoms were repeatedly measured by the DASS-21 scale. Group-based Trajectory Models methods were applied to identify clusters of similar depression trajectories. Trajectory clusters were characterized descriptively and with a Multinomial response model.
Results
Three distinct trajectories were identified. The ‘Highly affected’ trajectory (13%) had a larger presence of younger and female participants with lower average income, higher levels of past depression, and living alone. A majority of individuals in the ‘Unaffected’ trajectory (52%) were of medium or high average income, older average age, without previous depression symptoms, and not living alone. The ‘Moderately affected’ trajectory (35%) had a composition intermediate between the two opposite ‘extreme’ trajectories.
Conclusions
This study is among few studies investigating depression trajectories up to the time when COVID-19 vaccination was readily available to the entire population. During these 18 months of the pandemic, depressive symptoms increased in a substantial percentage of participants. Economic support, high-quality health care system, and moderate containment measures did not sufficiently protect all population subgroups from adverse, potentially long-term psychological pandemic impacts.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Purpose
This study describes factors associated with COVID-19 precautions (i.e., self-isolation and the use of personal protective equipment) among a sample of adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) in Ontario, Canada.
Methods
The sample included 756 home care recipients with IDD who did not test positive for COVID-19 between March 2020 and July 2021. Among these, some received COVID-19 precautions. Precaution data were obtained from a large metropolitan organization serving persons with IDD in Ontario, and linked to home care assessment data. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using logistic regression models to examine the association between COVID-19 cautions and demographic and clinical factors. Effect modification and interactions were explored.
Results
One hundred twenty-seven (16.8%) home care clients experienced precautions. After adjustment, congregate setting, aggression, and limited mobility were significantly associated with COVID-19 precautions. Age modified the relationship between congregate setting and precautions.
Conclusions
Pandemic responses need to recognize the impact on subgroups of adults with IDD, such as those living in congregate settings (including younger individuals) or engaging in responsive behaviors. How these precautions impacted individuals–in the short and long term–warrants further investigation.

AB  - Background
Evidence increasingly shows that the risk of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 is associated with a hypercoagulable state. Several organizations have released guidelines for the management of COVID-19-related coagulopathy and prevention of VTE. However, an urgent need exists for practical guidance on the management of arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in this setting.
Research Question
What is the current available evidence informing the prevention and management of arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19?
Study Design and Methods
A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) format that address urgent clinical questions regarding prevention and management of arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19. Using MEDLINE via PubMed, a literature search was conducted and references were screened for inclusion. Data from included studies were summarized and reviewed by the panel. Consensus for the direction and strength of recommendations was achieved using a modified Delphi survey.
Results
The review and analysis of the literature based on 11 PICO questions resulted in 11 recommendations. Overall, a low quality of evidence specific to the population with COVID-19 was found. Consequently, many of the recommendations were based on indirect evidence and prior guidelines in similar populations without COVID-19.
Interpretation
The existing evidence and panel consensus do not suggest a major departure from the management of arterial thrombosis according to recommendations predating the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on the optimal strategies for prevention and management of arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 are sparse. More high-quality evidence is needed to inform management strategies in these patients.

KW  - Hepcidin and transferrin receptor
AB  - Importance
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous metabolic alterations have been observed in individuals with this disease. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 can mimic the action of hepcidin, altering intracellular iron metabolism, but gaps remain in the understanding of possible outcomes in other pathways involved in the iron cycle.
Objective
To profile iron, ferritin and hepcidin levels and transferrin receptor gene expression in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between June 2020 and September 2020.
Design, setting and participants
Cross-sectional study that evaluated iron metabolism markers in 427 participants, 218 with COVID-19 and 209 without the disease.
Exposures
The primary exposure was positive diagnose to COVID-19 in general population of Santo André and São Bernardo cities. The positive and negative diagnose were determinate through RT-qPCR.
Main outcomes and measures
Devido a evidências de alterações do ciclo do ferro em pacientes diagnosticados com COVID-19 e devido a corregulação entre hepcidina e receptor de transferrina, uma análise da expressão gênica deste último, poderia trazer insights sobre o estado de ferro celular. A hipótese foi confirmada, mostrando aumento da expressão de receptor de transferrina concomitante com redução do nível de hepcidina circulante.
Results
Serum iron presented lower values in individuals diagnosed with COVID-19, whereas serum ferritin presented much higher values in infected patients. Elderly subjects had lower serum iron levels and higher ferritin levels, and men with COVID-19 had higher ferritin values than women. Serum hepcidin was lower in the COVID-19 patient group and transferrin receptor gene expression was higher in the infected patient group compared to controls.
Conclusions and relevance
COVID-19 causes changes in several iron cycle pathways, with iron and ferritin levels being markers that reflect the state and evolution of infection, as well as the prognosis of the disease. The increased expression of the transferrin receptor gene suggests increased iron internalization and the mimicry of hepcidin action by SARS-CoV-2, reduces iron export via ferroportin, which would explain the low circulating levels of iron by intracellular trapping.

AB  - Aotearoa New Zealand has been identified, by several measures, as being one of a few developed countries that have weathered the COVID‐19 pandemic in the best possible way. This outcome is generally attributed to strict but effective public health measures that included – besides very high vaccination rates – national and regional lockdowns, as well as total closure of the border except for returning citizens (who were subject to mandatory quarantining). Concurrent fiscal and monetary policies contributed to economic outcomes that remained remarkably buoyant. In this paper we assess the importance of public interventions in New Zealand triggered by the pandemic relative to the mitigating effects of the country being an island nation with a small population scale, low population density and remote location. We summarize the recent international literature, estimate simple but representative cross‐country regression models, and provide a qualitative evaluation of the public policy response. We find that the favourable effects of low average population density, remoteness and the absence of land borders have indeed been of great benefit. Geography assisted in the effectiveness of the elimination strategy which was only abandoned in favour of a mitigation strategy once the less severe but highly contagious Omicron variants arrived in early 2022. Hence, while a remote and peripheral location is generally seen as economically disadvantageous, during a pandemic it delays the spread of a viral disease and provides the opportunity to focus on interventions to maintain economic activity, develop effective public health responses and learn from the experience of less remote nations.
Resumen
Aotearoa Nueva Zelanda ha sido identificada, según varios estudios, como uno de los pocos países desarrollados que han capeado la pandemia de COVID‐19 de la mejor manera posible. Este resultado se atribuye generalmente a las estrictas pero eficaces medidas de salud pública que incluyeron, junto con tasas de vacunación muy elevadas, confinamientos nacionales y regionales, así como el cierre total de su frontera excepto para los ciudadanos que regresaban, sujetos a cuarentena obligatoria. Las políticas fiscales y monetarias concomitantes contribuyeron a unos resultados económicos que se mantuvieron notablemente boyantes. En este artículo se evaluó la importancia de las intervenciones públicas en Nueva Zelanda desencadenadas por la pandemia en relación con los efectos atenuantes de que el país sea una nación insular con una escala de población pequeña, baja densidad de población y una ubicación remota. Se resumió la bibliografía internacional reciente, se estimaron modelos de regresión entre países sencillos pero representativos y se ofreció una evaluación cualitativa de la respuesta de las políticas públicas. Se comprobó que los efectos favorables de la baja densidad media de la población, la lejanía y la ausencia de fronteras terrestres fueron notablemente beneficiosos. La geografía contribuyó a la eficacia de la estrategia de eliminación, que sólo se abandonó en favor de una estrategia de mitigación una vez que a principios de 2022 llegaron las variantes Omicron, menos graves pero altamente contagiosas. Por lo tanto, aunque una ubicación remota y periférica suele considerarse económicamente desventajosa, durante una pandemia retrasa la propagación de una enfermedad vírica y brinda la oportunidad de plantear intervenciones centradas en mantener la actividad económica, desarrollar respuestas eficaces de salud pública y aprender de la experiencia de las naciones menos remotas.

アオテアロア・ニュージーランドは、複数の対策によって、新型コロナウイルス感染症のパンデミックを可能な限り最善の方法で乗り切った数少ない先進国の1つであると認識されている。これは概して、非常に高いワクチン接種率、国及び地域のロックダウン、帰国した国民 (強制隔離の対象となった)を除く全面的な国境閉鎖など、厳格ではあるが効果的な公衆衛生対策による結果である。財政政策と金融政策を同時に実施することで経済的成果が得られ、経済は著しい上昇傾向を保持していた。本稿では、ニュージーランドは人口規模が小さく、人口密度が低く、遠隔地にある島国であることによる緩和効果に対する、パンデミックによって引き起こされたニュージーランドにおける公的介入の重要性を評価する。最近の国際的な研究論文を要約し、単純だが典型的なクロスカントリーな回帰モデルを推定し、公共政策の効果の定性的評価を実施する。人口密度が平均的に低いこと、遠隔地であること、そして地上での国境が存在しないことによる好ましい効果が、実に大きな利益となっていることがわかる。地理的要因は排除的政策の有効性を支持するが、2022年初頭にそれほど深刻ではないが感染力の強いオミクロン変異株が登場すると、緩和政策が支持されて、排除的政策は放棄された。つまり、遠隔地や辺境地は、一般的に経済的に不利であると見られているが、パンデミックの間はウイルス性疾患の蔓延を遅らせ、経済活動を維持するための介入を行い、効果的な公衆衛生対策を開発し、それほど遠隔地ではない国の経験から学ぶことに注力する機会を提供してくれる。

AB  - Introduction
Governments around the world suspended immunization outreach to control COVID-19 spread. Many have since resumed services with an emphasis on catch-up vaccinations. This paper evaluated immunization disruptions during India’s March-May 2020 lockdown and the extent to which subsequent catch-up efforts reversed them in Rajasthan, India.
Methods
In this retrospective observational study, we conducted phone surveys to collect immunization details for 2,144 children that turned one year old between January and October 2020. We used logistic regressions to compare differences in immunization timeliness and completed first-year immunization status among children that were due immunizations just before (unexposed), during (heavily exposed), and after (post-exposure) the lockdown.
Results
Relative to unexposed children, heavily exposed children were significantly less likely to be immunized at or before 9 months (OR 0.550; 95% CI 0.367–0.824; p = 0.004), but more likely to be immunized at 10–12 months (OR 1.761; 95% CI 1.196–2.591; p = 0.004). They were also less likely to have completed their key first-year immunizations (OR 0.624; 95% CI 0.478–0.816; p = 0.001) by the time of survey. In contrast, post-exposure children showed no difference in timeliness or completed first-year immunizations relative to unexposed children, despite their younger age. First-year immunization coverage among heavily exposed children decreased by 6.9 pp to 10.4 pp (9.7% to 14.0%). Declines in immunization coverage were larger among children in households that were poorer, less educated, lower caste, and residing in COVID red zones, although subgroup comparisons were not statistically significant.
Conclusion
Disruptions to immunization services resulted in children missing immunization during the lockdown, but catch-up efforts after it was eased ensured many children were reached at later ages. Nevertheless, catch-up was incomplete and children due their immunizations during the lockdown remained less likely to be fully immunized 4–5 months after it lifted, even as younger cohorts due immunizations in June or later returned to pre-lockdown schedules.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic increased stress and reduced wellness for patients and physicians alike. The uncertainty, frequent changes, fear of illness and death, and supply chain issues taxed an already broken health care system. The pandemic undermined the factors that allow for a healthy workplace: control, predictability, and certainty. During this time, rates of depression, suicidality, and anxiety all increased among physicians and the community at large. These challenges were aggravated by disagreements regarding masking and vaccinations. These factors, as well as the degree to which people felt valued or not also contributed to burnout. Some changes such as the transition to telemedicine, although initially stressful, led to patient satisfaction and allowed clinical care to continue. Other changes, such as trying to homeschool, or watching young children while also trying to work were less desirable. Patients and physicians did their best to combat isolation, fear, anxiety, and the numerous societal changes. Burnout fluctuated throughout the pandemic related to local and systemic factors such as rates of infection, vaccination, supply chain issues, and individual support. The pandemic highlighted problems with our health care system, including structural racism, health care disparities, and how easily the system can be overwhelmed. Physicians may have been thrown into roles they did not feel comfortable filling and may have had insufficient staff to practice in the way they wanted. These factors led to frustration among patients and physicians alike. The National Plan for Health Workforce Well-Being outlines the need for health care reform to allow for effective and safe health care while protecting clinicians from burnout.

AB  - Summary
Background
There are a growing number of case reports of various autoimmune diseases occurring after COVID-19, yet there is no large-scale population-based evidence to support this potential association. This study provides a closer insight into the association between COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases and reveals discrepancies across sex, age, and race of participants.
Methods
This is a retrospective cohort study based on the TriNetX U.S. Collaborative Network. In the test-negative design, cases were participants with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results for SARS-CoV-2, while controls were participants who tested negative and were not diagnosed with COVID-19 throughout the follow-up period. Patients with COVID-19 and controls were propensity score-matched (1: 1) for age, sex, race, adverse socioeconomic status, lifestyle-related variables, and comorbidities. The primary endpoint is the incidence of newly recorded autoimmune diseases. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confident intervals (CIs) of autoimmune diseases were calculated between propensity score-matched groups with the use of Cox proportional-hazards regression models.
Findings
Between January 1st, 2020 and December 31st, 2021, 3,814,479 participants were included in the study (888,463 cases and 2,926,016 controls). After matching, the COVID-19 cohort exhibited significantly higher risks of rheumatoid arthritis (aHR:2.98, 95% CI:2.78–3.20), ankylosing spondylitis (aHR:3.21, 95% CI:2.50–4.13), systemic lupus erythematosus (aHR:2.99, 95% CI:2.68–3.34), dermatopolymyositis (aHR:1.96, 95% CI:1.47–2.61), systemic sclerosis (aHR:2.58, 95% CI:2.02–3.28), Sjögren's syndrome (aHR:2.62, 95% CI:2.29–3.00), mixed connective tissue disease (aHR:3.14, 95% CI:2.26–4.36), Behçet's disease (aHR:2.32, 95% CI:1.38–3.89), polymyalgia rheumatica (aHR:2.90, 95% CI:2.36–3.57), vasculitis (aHR:1.96, 95% CI:1.74–2.20), psoriasis (aHR:2.91, 95% CI:2.67–3.17), inflammatory bowel disease (aHR:1.78, 95%CI:1.72–1.84), celiac disease (aHR:2.68, 95% CI:2.51–2.85), type 1 diabetes mellitus (aHR:2.68, 95%CI:2.51–2.85) and mortality (aHR:1.20, 95% CI:1.16–1.24).
Interpretation
COVID-19 is associated with a different degree of risk for various autoimmune diseases. Given the large sample size and relatively modest effects these findings should be replicated in an independent dataset. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Background
Health care personnel (HCP) have experienced significant SARS-CoV-2 risk, but exposure settings among HCP COVID-19 cases are poorly characterized.
Methods
We assessed exposure settings among HCP COVID-19 cases in the United States from March 2020 to March 2021 with reported exposures (n = 83,775) using national COVID-19 surveillance data. Exposure setting and reported community incidence temporal trends were described using breakpoint estimation. Among cases identified before initiation of COVID-19 vaccination programs (n = 65,650), we used separate multivariable regression models to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for associations of community incidence with health care and household and/or community exposures.
Results
Health care exposures were the most reported (52.0%), followed by household (30.8%) and community exposures (25.6%). Health care exposures and community COVID-19 incidence showed similar temporal trends. In adjusted analyses, HCP cases were more likely to report health care exposures (aPR = 1.31; 95% CI:1.26-1.36) and less likely to report household and/or community exposures (aPR = 0.73; 95% CI:0.70-0.76) under the highest vs lowest community incidence levels.
Discussion
These findings highlight HCP exposure setting temporal trends and workplace exposure hazards under high community incidence. Findings also underscore the need for robust collection of work-related data in infectious disease surveillance.
Conclusions
Many reported HCP cases experienced occupational COVID-19 exposures, particularly during periods of higher community COVID-19 incidence.

AB  - Summary
Kidney involvement is common in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), and our understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on short- and long-term kidney outcomes has evolved over the course of the pandemic. Initial key questions centered on the spectrum and degree of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Investigators worldwide have explored the association between COVID-19–associated AKI and short-term outcomes, including inpatient mortality and disease severity. Even as treatments evolved, vaccinations were developed, and newer viral variants arose, subsets of patients were identified as at continued high risk for major adverse kidney outcomes. In this review, we explore key topics of continued relevance including the following: (1) a comparison of COVID-19–associated AKI with AKI developing in other clinical settings; (2) the ongoing controversy over kidney tropism in the setting of COVID-19 and the potential for competitive binding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 to prevent viral cell entry; and (3) the identification of high-risk patients for adverse outcomes to inform long-term outpatient management. Patients at particularly high risk for adverse kidney outcomes include those with APOL1 high-risk genotype status. Biomarkers of injury, inflammation, tubular health, and repair measured in both the blood and urine may hold prognostic significance.

AB  - Summary
Background
While the COVID-19 pandemic will increase mortality due to the virus, it is also likely to increase mortality indirectly. In this study, we estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths resulting from the potential disruption of health systems and decreased access to food.
Methods
We modelled three scenarios in which the coverage of essential maternal and child health interventions is reduced by 9·8–51·9% and the prevalence of wasting is increased by 10–50%. Although our scenarios are hypothetical, we sought to reflect real-world possibilities, given emerging reports of the supply-side and demand-side effects of the pandemic. We used the Lives Saved Tool to estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths under each scenario, in 118 low-income and middle-income countries. We estimated additional deaths for a single month and extrapolated for 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.
Findings
Our least severe scenario (coverage reductions of 9·8–18·5% and wasting increase of 10%) over 6 months would result in 253 500 additional child deaths and 12 200 additional maternal deaths. Our most severe scenario (coverage reductions of 39·3–51·9% and wasting increase of 50%) over 6 months would result in 1 157 000 additional child deaths and 56 700 additional maternal deaths. These additional deaths would represent an increase of 9·8–44·7% in under-5 child deaths per month, and an 8·3–38·6% increase in maternal deaths per month, across the 118 countries. Across our three scenarios, the reduced coverage of four childbirth interventions (parenteral administration of uterotonics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants, and clean birth environments) would account for approximately 60% of additional maternal deaths. The increase in wasting prevalence would account for 18–23% of additional child deaths and reduced coverage of antibiotics for pneumonia and neonatal sepsis and of oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea would together account for around 41% of additional child deaths.
Interpretation
Our estimates are based on tentative assumptions and represent a wide range of outcomes. Nonetheless, they show that, if routine health care is disrupted and access to food is decreased (as a result of unavoidable shocks, health system collapse, or intentional choices made in responding to the pandemic), the increase in child and maternal deaths will be devastating. We hope these numbers add context as policy makers establish guidelines and allocate resources in the days and months to come.

AB  - In 2015, the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, in its only award for treatments of infectious diseases since six decades prior, honoured the discovery of ivermectin (IVM), a multifaceted drug deployed against some of the world’s most devastating tropical diseases. Since March 2020, when IVM was first used against a new global scourge, COVID-19, more than 20 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have tracked such inpatient and outpatient treatments. Six of seven meta-analyses of IVM treatment RCTs reporting in 2021 found notable reductions in COVID-19 fatalities, with a mean 31% relative risk of mortality vs. controls. During mass IVM treatments in Peru, excess deaths fell by a mean of 74% over 30 days in its ten states with the most extensive treatments. Reductions in deaths correlated with the extent of IVM distributions in all 25 states with p < 0.002. Sharp reductions in morbidity using IVM were also observed in two animal models, of SARS-CoV-2 and a related betacoronavirus. The indicated biological mechanism of IVM, competitive binding with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, is likely non-epitope specific, possibly yielding full efficacy against emerging viral mutant strains.

AB  - This research develops a humanitarian cold supply chain model with equity consideration for COVID-19 vaccine distribution during a pandemic, considering deprivation cost and an important social concept named equity. The proposed comprehensive plan minimizes all incurred costs, including transportation costs, shortage costs, deprivation costs, and holding costs, while aiming at eliminating infection and mortality rates. The proposed three-echelon supply chain model includes suppliers, distributors, and affected regions (ARs), as destinations. We apply the proposed model to the actual vaccine distribution data during the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is developed to minimize the costs and satisfy the demand goals in the vaccine distribution plan. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates how total and deprivation costs affect each other, helping the managers establish a trade-off between them. The results show that appropriate supply chain planning can minimize logistics and social costs. The proposed model can help policymakers, and decision-makers better understand the importance of equity and implement a fair distribution of vaccines, considering the deprivation cost as a social cost.

AB  - Whilst it is now widely recognised that routine immunisation (RI) was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and further so in 2021, the extent of continued interruptions in 2022 and/or rebounds to previous trends remains unclear. We modelled country-specific RI trends using validated estimates of national coverage from the World Health Organisation and United Nation Children’s Fund for 182 countries (accounting for > 97% of children globally), to project expected diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis-containing vaccine first-dose (DTP1), third-dose (DTP3) and measles-containing vaccine first-dose (MCV1) coverage for 2020–2022 based on pre-pandemic trends (from 2000 to 2019). We provide further evidence of peak pandemic immunisation disruption in 2021, followed by tentative recovery in 2022. We report a 3.4% (95 %CI: [2.5%; 4.4%]) decline in global DTP3 coverage in 2021 compared to 2000–2019 trends, from an expected 89.8% to reported 86.4%. This coverage gap reduced to a 2.7% (95 %CI: [1.8%; 3.6%]) decline in 2022, with reported coverage rising to 87.2%. Similar results were seen for DTP1 and MCV1. Whilst partial rebounds are encouraging, global coverage decline translates to a 17-year setback in RI to 2005 levels, and the majority of countries retain coverage at or lower than pre-pandemic levels. The Americas, Africa, and Asia were the most impacted regions; and low- and middle-income countries the most affected income groups. The number of annual Zero Dose (ZD) children – indicating those receiving no immunisations – increased from 12.1 million (M) globally in 2019 to a peak of 16.7 M in 2021, then reduced to 13.1 M in 2022. Overall, we estimate an excess of 8.8 M ZD children cumulatively in 2020–2022 compared to pre-pandemic levels. This work can be used as an objective baseline to inform future interventions to prioritise and target interventions, and facilitate catch-up of growing populations of under- and un-immunised children.

AB  - The COVID-19 global pandemic has caused significant global economic and social disruption. We use global data on cases and deaths, and public health and economic policy responses to the pandemic, to illustrate the alternative past and potential future trajectories of the pandemic. Shocks to labor and sectoral productivity, consumption, government expenditure, and country and sector risk premia are used within a global multisectoral intertemporal general equilibrium model: G-Cubed, to assess the economic impacts of COVID-19 under those scenarios. We illustrate the vital role of public health responses in managing a pandemic and restoring confidence among economic agents. The role of global coordination amidst a pandemic is also highlighted. We also compare the GDP projections under the alternative scenarios with the actual GDP outcomes in 2020 and 2021. Despite the uncertainties regarding the health outcomes of COVID-19 and the health and economic policy responses to the pandemic, we demonstrate that the actual outcomes lie within those projected for the scenarios.

The causal representation provided by these algorithms enables transparency and explainability, which is necessary for decision making in critical real-world problems. Yet, causal ML has had limited impact in practice compared to associational ML. This paper investigates the challenges of causal ML with application to COVID-19 UK pandemic data. We collate data from various public sources and investigate what the various structure learning algorithms learn from these data. We explore the impact of different data formats on algorithms spanning different classes of learning, and assess the results produced by each algorithm, and groups of algorithms, in terms of graphical structure, model dimensionality, sensitivity analysis, confounding variables, predictive and interventional inference. We use these results to highlight open problems in causal structure learning and directions for future research.

AB  - Summary
Current evidence suggests that severity and mortality of COVID-19 is higher in men than in women, whereas women might be at increased risk of COVID-19 reinfection and development of long COVID. Differences between sexes have been observed in other infectious diseases and in the response to vaccines. Sex-specific expression patterns of proteins mediating virus binding and entry, and divergent reactions of the immune and endocrine system, in particular the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, in response to acute stress might explain the higher severity of COVID-19 in men. In this Personal View, we discuss how sex hormones, comorbidities, and the sex chromosome complement influence these mechanisms in the context of COVID-19. Due to its role in the severity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we argue that sexual dimorphism has potential implications for disease treatment, public health measures, and follow-up of patients predisposed to the development of long COVID. We suggest that sex differences could be considered in future pandemic surveillance and treatment of patients with COVID-19 to help to achieve better disease stratification and improved outcomes.

AB  - It is essential to evaluate patient outcomes at an early stage when dealing with a pandemic to provide optimal clinical care and resource management. Many methods have been proposed to provide a roadmap against different pandemics, including the recent pandemic disease COVID-19. Due to recurrent epidemic waves of COVID-19, which have been observed in many countries, mathematical modeling and forecasting of COVID-19 are still necessary as long as the world continues to battle against the pandemic. Modeling may aid in determining which interventions to try or predict future growth patterns. In this article, we design a combined approach for analyzing any pandemic in two separate parts. In the first part of the paper, we develop a recurrent SEIRS compartmental model to predict recurrent outbreak patterns of diseases. Due to its time-varying parameters, our model is able to reflect the dynamics of infectious diseases, and to measure the effectiveness of the restrictive measures. We discuss the stable solutions of the corresponding autonomous system with frozen parameters. We focus on the regime shifts and tipping points; then we investigate tipping phenomena due to parameter drifts in our time-varying parameters model that exhibits a bifurcation in the frozen-in case. Furthermore, we propose an optimal numerical design for estimating the system’s parameters. In the second part, we introduce machine learning models to strengthen the methodology of our paper in data analysis, particularly for prediction scenarios. We use MLP, RBF, LSTM, ANFIS, and GRNN for training and evaluation of COVID-19. Then, we compare the results with the recurrent dynamical system in the fitting process and prediction scenario. We also confirm results by implementing our methods on the released data on COVID-19 by WHO for Italy, Germany, Iran, and South Africa between 1/22/2020 and 7/24/2021, when people were engaged with different variants including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. The results of this article show that the dynamic model is adequate for long-term analysis and data fitting, as well as obtaining parameters affecting the epidemic. However, it is ineffective in providing a long-term forecast. In contrast machine learning methods effectively provide disease prediction, although they do not provide analysis such as dynamic models. Finally, some metrics, including RMSE, R-Squared, and accuracy, are used to evaluate the machine learning models. These metrics confirm that ANFIS and RBF perform better than other methods in training and testing zones.

AB  - Despite tremendous global efforts since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, still only a limited number of prophylactic and therapeutic options are available. Although vaccination is the most effective measure in preventing morbidity and mortality, there is a need for safe and effective post-infection treatment medication. In this study, we explored a pipeline of 21 potential candidates, examined in the Calu-3 cell line for their antiviral efficacy, for drug repurposing. Ralimetinib and nafamostat, clinically used drugs, have emerged as attractive candidates. Due to the inherent limitations of the selected drugs, we formulated targeted liposomes suitable for both systemic and intranasal administration. Non-targeted and targeted nafamostat liposomes (LipNaf) decorated with an Apolipoprotein B peptide (ApoB-P) as a specific lung-targeting ligand were successfully developed. The developed liposomal formulations of nafamostat were found to possess favorable physicochemical properties including nano size (119–147 nm), long-term stability of the normally rapidly degrading compound in aqueous solution, negligible leakage from the liposomes upon storage, and a neutral surface charge with low polydispersity index (PDI). Both nafamostat and ralimetinib liposomes showed good cellular uptake and lack of cytotoxicity, and non-targeted LipNaf demonstrated enhanced accumulation in the lungs following intranasal (IN) administration in non-infected mice. LipNaf retained its anti-SARS-CoV 2 activity in Calu 3 cells with only a modest decrease, exhibiting complete inhibition at concentrations >100 nM. IN, but not intraperitoneal (IP) treatment with targeted LipNaf resulted in a trend to reduced viral load in the lungs of K18-hACE2 mice compared to targeted empty Lip. Nevertheless, upon removal of outlier data, a statistically significant 1.9-fold reduction in viral load was achieved. This observation further highlights the importance of a targeted delivery into the respiratory tract. In summary, we were able to demonstrate a proof-of-concept of drug repurposing by liposomal formulations with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The biodistribution and bioactivity studies with LipNaf suggest an IN or inhalation route of administration for optimal therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - Decisions on public health measures to contain a pandemic are often based on parameters such as expected disease burden and additional mortality due to the pandemic. Both pandemics and non-pharmaceutical interventions to fight pandemics, however, produce economic, social, and medical costs. The costs are, for example, caused by changes in access to healthcare, social distancing, and restrictions on economic activity. These factors indirectly influence health outcomes in the short- and long-term perspective. In a narrative review based on targeted literature searches, we develop a comprehensive perspective on the concepts available as well as the challenges of estimating the overall disease burden and the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 interventions from both epidemiological and economic perspectives, particularly during the early part of a pandemic. We review the literature and discuss relevant components that need to be included when estimating the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review presents data sources and different forms of death counts, and discusses empirical findings on direct and indirect effects of the pandemic and interventions on disease burden as well as the distribution of health risks.
