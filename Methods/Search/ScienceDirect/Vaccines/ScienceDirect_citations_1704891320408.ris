AB  - The largest burden of COVID-19 is carried by the elderly, and persons living in nursing homes are particularly vulnerable. However, 94% of the global population is younger than 70 years and 86% is younger than 60 years. The objective of this study was to accurately estimate the infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID-19 among non-elderly people in the absence of vaccination or prior infection. In systematic searches in SeroTracker and PubMed (protocol: https://osf.io/xvupr), we identified 40 eligible national seroprevalence studies covering 38 countries with pre-vaccination seroprevalence data. For 29 countries (24 high-income, 5 others), publicly available age-stratified COVID-19 death data and age-stratified seroprevalence information were available and were included in the primary analysis. The IFRs had a median of 0.034% (interquartile range (IQR) 0.013–0.056%) for the 0–59 years old population, and 0.095% (IQR 0.036–0.119%) for the 0–69 years old. The median IFR was 0.0003% at 0–19 years, 0.002% at 20–29 years, 0.011% at 30–39 years, 0.035% at 40–49 years, 0.123% at 50–59 years, and 0.506% at 60–69 years. IFR increases approximately 4 times every 10 years. Including data from another 9 countries with imputed age distribution of COVID-19 deaths yielded median IFR of 0.025–0.032% for 0–59 years and 0.063–0.082% for 0–69 years. Meta-regression analyses also suggested global IFR of 0.03% and 0.07%, respectively in these age groups. The current analysis suggests a much lower pre-vaccination IFR in non-elderly populations than previously suggested. Large differences did exist between countries and may reflect differences in comorbidities and other factors. These estimates provide a baseline from which to fathom further IFR declines with the widespread use of vaccination, prior infections, and evolution of new variants.

AB  - Background
Primary Aldosteronism (PA) is a common subtype of hypertension that increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular and kidney events. The impact of COVID-19 on patients with PA is not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on patients with PA and compare their outcomes with hypertensive patients with essential hypertension.
Methods
A cohort study was conducted using data from the Trinetx platform, including 9,817,307 participants enrolled between January 1, 2020, and July 31, 2022. The study group consisted of participants who tested positive for PCR SARS-CoV-2. The primary outcome was critical care and all-cause mortality, while the secondary outcomes were major adverse cardiac events (MACE) or major adverse kidney events (MAKE). The study included 4814 patients with PA and 4814 hypertensive controls.
Results
Patients with PA had a higher risk of critical outcomes than the hypertensive control group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.14, p = 0.001). Moreover, they had higher risks of MACE (aHR 1.32, p < 0.001) and MAKE (aHR 1.36, p < 0.001) for up to 180 days after COVID-19. The analysis of the aHR as a horizon plot after discharge showed that patients with pre-existing PA and COVID-19 had the highest risk of critical outcomes at 7 months (aHR = 1.21), MACE (aHR = 1.35) at 9 months, and MAKE (aHR = 1.47) at 10 months compared to those with EH.
Conclusions
This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the cardiovascular impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with PA. The findings underscore the increased risk of mortality, critical care, MACE, and MAKE among patients with PA and COVID-19. The study highlights the need for continued optimization of strategies for follow-up care for patients with PA after SARS-CoV-2 infections.

AB  - The theme of the 76th session of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly (2021) stresses on the need to tackle the global coronavirus pandemic and other challenging issues presently staring our world in the face. World leaders have tried to contribute their own quota towards changing the present narrative by vaccinating a large portion of their population. However, vaccine hesitancy has served as a barrier to achieving herd immunity in nations-Nigeria inclusive. The sociological theory of phenomenology and the concept of ‘‘sick role’’ were employed as the theoretical framework upon which the study was anchored. Descriptive cross-sectional survey and purposive sampling were used in the work. Data for the study was generated through primary (online survey of 150 respondents) and secondary sources. The content and thematic techniques were used to analyze the data so gathered. The causal factors of vaccine hesitancy in Nigeria were uncovered to include: ‘negative human awareness’, lack of or low public knowledge/agreement on public health need of the vaccine, disconnect (public mistrust of government) between the people and government and lack of awareness/proximity of vaccination points, among others. The paper recommends strategies for massive advocacy/social mobilization to counter negative social interaction and narratives making the rounds on the intake of the COVID-19 vaccine by the Nigerian populace to build general consensus on the need for the vaccine and adoption of the Nigeria Polio vaccination model of taking vaccine down to the people.

AB  - Introduction
Despite ongoing efforts to vaccinate communities against COVID-19, the necessity of face mask use in controlling the pandemic remains subject to debate. Several studies have investigated face masks and COVID-19, covering smaller and less diverse populations than this study's sample. This study examines a hypothesized association of face-covering mandates with COVID-19 mortality decline across 44 countries in 2 continents.
Methods
In a retrospective cohort study, changes in COVID-19‒related daily mortality rate per million population from February 15 to May 31, 2020 were compared between 27 countries with and 17 countries without face mask mandates in nearly 1 billion (911,446,220 total) people. Longitudinal mixed effect modeling was applied and adjusted for over 10 relevant demographic, social, clinical, and time-dependent confounders.
Results
Average COVID-19 mortality per million was 288.54 in countries without face mask policies and 48.40 in countries with face mask policies. In no mask countries, adjusted average daily increase was 0.1553 − 0.0017 X (days since the first case) log deaths per million, compared with 0.0900 − 0.0009 X (days since the first case) log deaths per million in the countries with a mandate. A total of 60 days into the pandemic, countries without face mask mandates had an average daily increase of 0.0533 deaths per million, compared with the average daily increase of 0.0360 deaths per million for countries with face mask mandates.
Conclusions
This study's significant results show that face mask mandates were associated with lower COVID-19 deaths rates than the rates in countries without mandates. These findings support the use of face masks to prevent excess COVID-19 deaths and should be advised during airborne disease epidemics.

AB  - Since its global invasion in 2019, COVID-19 has affected several aspects of patients’ lives and posed a significant impact on the health care system. Several patient populations were identified to be at high risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or developing severe COVID-19-related sequelae. Conversely, anyone who has contracted SARS-CoV-2 is at risk to experience symptoms and signs consistent with post-COVID manifestations. Patients with asthma were initially thought to be at increased risk and severity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, accumulating evidence demonstrates that asthma endotypes/phenotypes and comorbidities influence the risk stratification in this population. Furthermore, initial concerns about the potentially increased risk of poor outcomes with asthma treatments such as inhaled corticosteroids and biologics have not been substantiated. In this review, we provide an update on COVID-19 and asthma, including risk of susceptibility, clinical manifestations and course in this population as well as discuss recommendations for management.

AB  - There is limited knowledge regarding the cardiovascular impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on emerging adults aged 18-25, a group that disproportionately contracts COVID-19. To guide future cardiovascular disease (CVD) research, policy, and practice, a scoping review was conducted to: (i) examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cardiovascular health of emerging adults; and (ii) identify strategies to screen for and manage COVID-19–related cardiovascular complications in this age group. A comprehensive search strategy was applied to several academic databases and grey literature sources. An updated search yielded 6738 articles, 147 of which were extracted and synthesized. Reports identified COVID-19–associated cardiac abnormalities, vascular alterations, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in emerging adults; based on data from student-athlete samples, prevalence estimates of myocarditis and cardiac abnormalities were 0.5%-3% and 0%-7%, respectively. Obesity, hypertension, CVD, congenital heart disease, and marginalization are potential risk factors for severe COVID-19, related cardiovascular complications, and mortality in this age group. As a screening modality for COVID-19–associated cardiac involvement, it is recommended that cardiac magnetic resonance imaging be indicated by a positive cardiac history and/or abnormal “triad” testing (cardiac troponin, electrocardiogram, and transthoracic echocardiogram) to improve diagnostic utility. To foster long-term cardiovascular health among emerging adults, cardiorespiratory fitness, health literacy and education, and telehealth accessibility should be priorities of health policy and clinical practice. Ultimately, surveillance data from the broader emerging adult population will be crucial to assess the long-term cardiovascular impact of both COVID-19 infection and vaccination, guide screening and management protocols, and inform CVD prevention efforts.
Résumé
Il existe peu de données portant sur les répercussions de la maladie à coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) sur le plan cardiovasculaire chez les jeunes adultes âgés de 18 à 25 ans, un groupe contractant la COVID-19 de façon disproportionnée. Afin d’orienter la recherche, les poli-tiques et les pratiques en matière de maladies cardiovasculaires (MCV), un examen exploratoire a été réalisé dans le but i) d’examiner les conséquences de la pandémie de la COVID-19 sur la santé cardiovasculaire des jeunes adultes, et ii) de proposer des stratégies de dépistage et de prise en charge des complications cardiovasculaires associées à la COVID-19 chez les personnes de cette tranche d’âge. Une recherche initiale exhaustive a été réalisée dans plusieurs bases de données universitaires et sources de littérature grise. Les résultats actualisés de cette recherche ont permis de recenser 6 738 articles, dont 147 ont été extraits et synthétisés. Les rapports faisaient état d’anomalies cardiaques, d’altérations vasculaires et de cas du syndrome inflammatoire multisystémique, tous associés à la COVID-19 chez les jeunes adultes. À la lumière des données sur les échantillons d’étudiants-athlètes, la prévalence des myocardites et des anomalies cardiaques se situait respectivement entre 0,5 et 3 %, et entre 0 et 7 % environ. Chez ce même groupe d’âge, l’obésité, l’hypertension, les MCV, les cardiopathies congénitales et la marginalisation constituent des facteurs de risque de COVID-19 sévère, de complications cardiovasculaires associées à la COVID-19 et de mortalité. Dans le cadre du dépistage des atteintes cardiaques associées à la COVID-19, il est recommandé, pour améliorer l’utilité diagnostique, d’indiquer l’imagerie par résonance magnétique cardiaque lors de l’existence d’antécédents cardiaques ou à la suite d’une « triade » de dépistages anormaux (la troponine cardiaque, l’électrocardiogramme et l’échocardiographie transthoracique). Afin de favoriser une bonne santé cardiovasculaire à long terme chez les jeunes adultes, il est recommandé que la capacité cardiorespiratoire, la littératie dans le domaine de la santé, l’éducation et l’accès à la télésanté soient intégrés à titre de priorités dans les politiques de santé et la pratique clinique. En définitive, les données de surveillance portant sur cette large tranche d’âge seront essentielles pour évaluer les répercussions cardiovasculaires à long terme (autant celles d'infections à la COVID-19 que celles de la vaccination), pour orienter les protocoles de dépistage et de prise en charge, ainsi que pour éclairer les efforts de prévention des MCV.

AB  - Based on data updated to 20 May 2020, the total recorded number of patients who died due to COVID-19-related reasons in Italy was 31,851. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who have died (including the number of comorbidities) are extremely relevant, especially to define those with a higher risk of mortality. Health authorities recommend influenza (flu) vaccinations in a number of categories at risk of serious medical complications, including: people aged ≥65 years, or patients with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), renal failure, cancer, immunodeficiencies, chronic hepatopathies, and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. The seasonal flu peak certainly preceded that of the pandemic; however, it would seem clear that the two viruses have been simultaneously circulating in Italy for a while. Hence, after the peak of seasonal flu, influenza-like illness-related (ILI) deaths started to grow again. While some of the excess mortality reported in the ILI group may be attributable to COVID-19, a question arises: do we have to consider this observation as a result of a random sequence of events or a potential relationship between the two viruses play a role? A cooperation mechanism intended at establishing an absolute advantage over the host could also be assumed; this system often takes place to boost the reproductive probabilities. A characterization of those who died due to virus-related reasons can be performed by cross-linking data (stored in different warehouses) from the same geographical area and developing electronic health records. It would be of great relevance to identify people at very high risk of mortality as a result of an overlapping or combination of risk factors that were separately reported in patients who died from COVID-19 or influenza. A description of the subgroup of people at higher risk of mortality will be crucial for prioritizing and implementing future public health prevention and treatment programs.

AB  - Summary
Background
Understanding mortality burden associated with communicable diseases is key to informing resource allocation, disease prevention and control efforts, and evaluating public health interventions. We quantified excess mortality among people notified with communicable diseases in Victoria, Australia.
Methods
Cases of communicable disease notified in Victoria between 1 January 1991 and 31 December 2021 were linked to the death registry. Informational gain obtained through linkage and 30-day case fatality rates were calculated for each disease. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated up to a year following illness onset.
Findings
There were 1,032,619 cases and 5985 (0.58%) died ≤30 days of illness onset. Following linkage, the 30-day case fatality rate increased more than 2-fold. Diseases with high 7-day SMR signifying excess mortality included invasive pneumococcal disease (167.7, 95% CI 153.4–182.7); listeriosis (166.2, 95% CI 121.2–218.3); invasive meningococcal disease (145.9, 95% CI 116.7–178.3); legionellosis (43.3, 95% CI 28.0–62.0); and COVID-19 (21.9, 95% CI 19.7–24.3). Most diseases exhibited a strong negative gradient, with high SMRs in the first 7-days of illness onset that reduced over time.
Interpretation
We demonstrated that the rate of death in Victoria's notifiable disease surveillance dataset is underestimated. Further, compared to a general population, there is evidence of elevated all-cause mortality among people notified with communicable diseases often up to one year following illness onset. Not all elevated risk is likely directly attributable to the communicable diseases of interest, rather, it may reflect underlying comorbidities or behaviours in these individuals. Regardless of attribution, infection with communicable diseases may represent a marker of mortality. Key to preventing deaths may be through timely and appropriate transition to primary and preventive healthcare following diagnosis.

AB  - Summary
Background
The impact of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections has changed significantly since 2020. However, there is a lack of up-to-date evidence of the epidemiology of these infections which is essential in order to appropriately guide infection control policy.
Aims
To identify the secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated mortality across different variants of concern.
Methods
A single-centre retrospective study of all nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 exposure events was conducted between 31st December 2020 and 31st December 2021. A secondary attack rate was calculated for nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection and time to positivity. Positive contacts were assessed for all-cause 30-day mortality.
Results
A total of 346 sequential index exposure events were examined, and 1378 susceptible contacts identified. Two hundred susceptible contacts developed SARS-CoV-2 infection (secondary attack rate of 15.5%). The majority of index cases (59%) did not result in any secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Where close contacts developed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 80% were detected within the first five days since last contact with the index case. The overall associated mortality among positive contacts across 2021 was 9%, with an estimated reduction of 68% when comparing periods of high Omicron versus Alpha transmission.
Conclusion
Our findings describe that most SARS-CoV-2 infections are detected within five days of contact with an index case; we have also demonstrated a considerably lower mortality rate with the Omicron variant in comparison to previous variants. These findings have important implications for informing and supporting infection control protocols to allow movement through the hospital, and ensure patients access care safely.

AB  - Obesity is strongly and independently associated with an increased risk of severe illness and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The pathophysiological changes that result from elevated body weight lead to metabolic dysfunction, chronic inflammation, impaired immunological responses, and multisystem disorders, which increase vulnerability to severe illness from COVID-19. While vaccination strategies are under way across the world, the second and third waves of the pandemic, along with the emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strains, continue to threaten the stability of medical systems worldwide. Furthermore, evidence from previous pandemics suggests that vaccines are less effective in obese individuals than in their healthy-weight counterparts over the long term. Therefore, a consideration of lifestyle changes that can boost metabolic health and immunity is critical to reduce the risk of complications and severe illness from viral infection. In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms linking excess body weight with COVID-19 morbidity. We also present evidence that intermittent fasting (IF), a dietary program that has gained popularity in recent years, may be an effective strategy to improve metabolic health and immunity and thus reduce the impact of obesity on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

AB  - In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adult heart transplantation. We highlight the decline in the number of adult transplantations performed throughout the pandemic as a consequence of restrictions imposed on individual programs and hospitals. There were challenges to maintaining cardiac transplant activity at multiple levels, including organ donation in intensive care units, logistical difficulties with organ procurement, and rapidly changing resource considerations at health system and jurisdictional levels. We also review the impact of COVID-19 on cardiac transplant recipients. Despite the high rates of morbidity and mortality observed during the initial phases of the pandemic among heart transplant patients infected with COVID-19, the availability of effective vaccines, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and specific antiviral therapies have drastically improved outcomes over time. Vaccines have proven to be safe and effective in reducing infections and illness severity, but specific considerations in the immunocompromised solid organ transplant population apply, including the need for additional booster doses to achieve sufficient immunisation. We further outline the strong rationale for vaccination before transplantation wherever possible. Finally, the COVID-19 response created a number of barriers to safe and efficient post-transplantation care. Given the need for frequent evaluation and monitoring, especially in the first several months after cardiac transplantation, the pandemic provided the impetus to improve virtual care delivery and explore noninvasive rejection surveillance through gene expression profiling. We hope that lessons learned will allow us to prepare and pivot effectively during future pandemics and health care emergencies.
Résumé
Dans cette revue, nous présentons une vue d’ensemble de l’influence de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur la transplantation cardiaque chez l’adulte. Nous soulignons la diminution du nombre de transplantations adultes réalisées tout au long de la pandémie en raison des restrictions imposées aux programmes individuels et aux hôpitaux. Le maintien de l’activité de transplantation cardiaque s’est heurté à de multiples difficultés, notamment le don d’organes dans les unités de soins intensifs, les problèmes logistiques liés à l’obtention des organes et l’évolution rapide des ressources au niveau des systèmes de santé et des juridictions. Nous examinons également l’incidence de la COVID-19 sur les transplantés cardiaques. Malgré les taux élevés de morbidité et de mortalité observés au cours des phases initiales de la pandémie chez les patients ayant subi une transplantation cardiaque et infectés par la COVID-19, la disponibilité de vaccins efficaces, d’une prophylaxie préexposition et de thérapies antivirales spécifiques a permis d’améliorer considérablement les résultats au fil du temps. Les vaccins se sont révélés sûrs et efficaces pour réduire les infections et la gravité de la maladie, mais des considérations spécifiques s’appliquent à la population immunosupprimée ayant subi une transplantation d’organe solide, notamment la nécessité d’administrer des doses de rappel supplémentaires pour parvenir à une immunisation suffisante. Nous soulignons en outre les arguments solides en faveur de la vaccination avant la transplantation, dans la mesure du possible. Enfin, la réponse à la COVID-19 a créé un certain nombre d’obstacles à l’innocuité et à l’efficacité des soins post-transplantation. Étant donné la nécessité d’une évaluation et d’un suivi fréquents, en particulier au cours des premiers mois suivant une transplantation cardiaque, la pandémie a donné l’élan nécessaire pour améliorer la prestation de soins virtuels et explorer la surveillance non invasive du rejet par l’entremise du profil d’expression génique. Nous espérons que les enseignements tirés nous permettront de nous préparer et de réagir efficacement lors de futures pandémies et urgences sanitaires.

AB  - The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic influenced the management of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. A paucity of data exists on outcome of patients with vasculitis following COVID-19, but mortality is higher than in the general population and comparable to patients undergoing haemodialysis or kidney transplant recipients (reported mortality rates of 20–25%). Delays in diagnosis have been reported, which are associated with sequelae such as dialysis-dependency. Management of ANCA-associated vasculitis has not changed with the aim to suppress disease activity and reduce burden of disease. The use of rituximab, an important and widely used agent, is associated with a more severe hospital course of COVID-19 and absence of antibodies following severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 infections, which prone patients to re-infection. Reports on vaccine antibody response are scarce at the moment, but preliminary findings point towards an impaired immune response, especially when patients receive rituximab as part of their treatment. Seropositivity was reported in less than 20% of patients when rituximab was administered within the prior six months, and the antibody response correlated with CD19+ B-cell repopulation. A delay in maintenance doses, if disease activity allows, has been suggested using a CD19+ B-cell guided strategy. Other immunosuppressive measures, which are used in ANCA-associated vasculitis, also impair humoral and cellular vaccine responses. Regular measurements of vaccine response or a healthcare-policy time-based strategy are indicated to provide additional doses (“booster”) of COVID-19 vaccines. This review summarizes a recent educational forum and a recent virtual meeting of the European Vasculitis Society (EUVAS) focusing on COVID-19.

AB  - Background and Aims
Mexico is among the countries with the highest estimated excess mortality rates due to the COVID–19 pandemic, with more than half of reported deaths occurring in adults younger than 65 years old. Although this behavior is presumably influenced by the young demographics and the high prevalence of metabolic diseases, the underlying mechanisms have not been determined.
Methods
The age–stratified case fatality rate (CFR) was estimated in a prospective cohort with 245 hospitalized COVID–19 cases, followed through time, for the period October 2020–September 2021. Cellular and inflammatory parameters were exhaustively investigated in blood samples by laboratory test, multiparametric flow cytometry and multiplex immunoassays.
Results
The CFR was 35.51%, with 55.2% of deaths recorded in middle–aged adults. On admission, hematological cell differentiation, physiological stress and inflammation parameters, showed distinctive profiles of potential prognostic value in patients under 65 at 7 days follow–up. Pre–existing metabolic conditions were identified as risk factors of poor outcomes. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), as single comorbidity or in combination with diabetes, had the highest risk for COVID–19 fatality. Of note, fatal outcomes in middle–aged patients were marked from admission by an inflammatory landscape and emergency myeloid hematopoiesis at the expense of functional lymphoid innate cells for antiviral immunosurveillance, including NK and dendritic cell subsets.
Conclusions
Comorbidities increased the development of imbalanced myeloid phenotype, rendering middle–aged individuals unable to effectively control SARS–CoV–2. A predictive signature of high–risk outcomes at day 7 of disease evolution as a tool for their early stratification in vulnerable populations is proposed.

AB  - Background
Before the advent of COVID-19 vaccines, hospitalizations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection during 2020 collapsed most medical centers worldwide. Disruptions in health care for clinical conditions other than COVID-19 were not uniform. Herein, we report the impact of COVID-19 on hospitalizations due to viral hepatitis in Spain.
Methods
Retrospective study of all hospitalizations in Spain during 10 months before (pre-pandemic period) and after (pandemic period) March 1st 2020. Admissions with a diagnosis of hepatitis B, C and/or delta were retrieved and compared using the Spanish National Registry of Hospital Discharges.
Results
Nationwide hospitalizations declined 14.6% during the pandemic period, from 3,144,164 to 2,684,845. This reduction was significantly more pronounced for admissions due to viral hepatitis (18.1% drop), falling from 46,521 to 38,115. During the pandemic period, patients admitted with viral hepatitis died significantly more frequently than during the pre-pandemic period (7.2% vs 6.1%; p < 0.001). Liver transplants significantly declined during the pandemic period. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 10.3% of patients hospitalized with viral hepatitis during the pandemic period. This subset of patients was older and died 2.4-fold more frequently than the rest, despite having advanced liver disease less frequently.
Conclusion
Hospitalizations due to viral hepatitis significantly declined in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients admitted with viral hepatitis experienced a greater mortality during the pandemic period. Deaths were more pronounced when coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 despite having advanced liver disease less frequently.

AB  - Objectives
In 2020, Croatia reported the first increase in the unemployment rate after six consecutive years of reduction in the number of unemployed persons. Unemployment is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality among unemployed persons. We estimated the number of potential excess deaths that could be associated with an increase in unemployment seen after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
Study design
This was a cross-sectional analytic study.
Methods
We used previously published meta-analyzed hazard ratios for the unemployment–mortality association and unemployment and mortality data from the Croatian Bureau of Statistics to estimate 1-year age-standardized deaths potentially attributable to COVID-19–related unemployment for persons aged 20–64 in Croatia.
Results
In January 2021, we observed a 19% increase in unemployment among persons aged 20–64 years compared with February 2020 (prepandemic). This increase in unemployment could lead to 23 excess deaths among newly unemployed persons. This would constitute a 42% increase in the number of deaths and 29% of all deaths among this group. Deaths were disproportionately higher among men and those aged >40 years.
Conclusions
To mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19–related unemployment on population health, interventions that will reduce the further spread of SARS-CoV-2 and policies that will ensure economic recovery and reduction of unemployment are needed. Job skills training and provision of legal and welfare advice programs for unemployed persons should be integrated with health interventions.

AB  - The climate crisis impacts child health, increasing the burden of pediatric healthcare. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ecological footprint of pediatric healthcare has significantly increased due to the use of personal protective equipment and the provision of large-scale testing and vaccination against COVID-19. The situation calls for coordinated action to make pediatric healthcare more resource-efficient. To achieve this goal, pediatricians should work together with children and parents in order to appropriately minimize the use of electricity, water, paper and plastic and promote environmental sustainability in healthcare and beyond. The present article discusses the main sources of environmental pollution in pediatric healthcare and proposes evidence-based solutions.

AB  - In the United States, COVID-19 has become a leading cause of death since 2020. However, the number of COVID-19 deaths reported from death certificates is likely to represent an underestimate of the total deaths related to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Estimating those deaths not captured through death certificates is important to understanding the full burden of COVID-19 on mortality. In this work, we explored enhancements to an existing approach by employing Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate unrecognized deaths attributed to COVID-19 using weekly state-level COVID-19 viral surveillance and mortality data in the United States from March 2020 to April 2021. We demonstrated our model using those aged ≥85 years who died. First, we used a spatial–temporal binomial regression model to estimate the percent of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. A spatial–temporal negative-binomial model was then used to estimate unrecognized COVID-19 deaths by exploiting the spatial–temporal association between SARS-CoV-2 percent positive and all-cause mortality counts using an excess mortality approach. Computationally efficient Bayesian inference was accomplished via the Polya-Gamma representation of the binomial and negative-binomial models. Among those aged ≥85 years, we estimated 58,200 (95% CI: 51,300, 64,900) unrecognized COVID-19 deaths, which accounts for 26% (95% CI: 24%, 29%) of total COVID-19 deaths in this age group. Our modeling results suggest that COVID-19 mortality and the proportion of unrecognized deaths among deaths attributed to COVID-19 vary by time and across states.

AB  - Background
Information about Cameroonians’ views toward coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and amenability to receiving a vaccine is emerging. Learning more about Cameroonians’ vaccine perspectives could guide prevention messaging and facilitate optimal communication modalities.
Objectives
The primary objective of this study was to analyze the willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine among Cameroonians, pending availability. The secondary objectives were to assess perceptions of COVID-19’s origin and to gauge views toward government-mandated vaccinations.
Methods
An 11-item questionnaire queried Cameroonians in-person and online, from March through May 2021, about their demographics and whether they believed that COVID-19 was man-made, whether COVID-19 vaccinations should be governmentally mandated, and whether they would receive a COVID-19 vaccine, if available. A free-text option inviting rationales for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was included. In-person participation took place on the grounds of St. Louis University in Douala, Cameroon, and was restricted to participants lacking Internet access or electronic mobile devices. Online participation included use of an electronic link that contained questionnaire content located within Google Forms.
Results
A total of 591 respondents participated by replying to at least 8 items on the questionnaire, 386 online and 205 in-person. Over 80% stated that they previously received a seasonal influenza vaccine. Roughly, 87% reported unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, if available. Approximately 95% of respondents disagreed with governmental mandates on COVID-19 vaccinations. About 75% attributed COVID-19 to man-made as opposed to natural beginnings. Seven respondents’ free-text comments cited lacking confidence in a COVID-19 vaccine, discriminatory COVID-19 vaccine distribution patterns in other parts of the world relative to Africa, and improper COVID-19 vaccine approval timeline.
Conclusion
Raising awareness of COVID-19 misconceptions and barriers to vaccine acceptance is integral to accomplishing immunization goals. Cameroonians’ pessimism in this study toward COVID-19 vaccination was multifaceted. Our findings signal a need for additional research that requests more qualitative insights, for example, interviews, focus groups, into vaccine aversion.

AB  - Background
From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, age (most importantly), male gender and various comorbidities were found to be associated with severe forms of COVID-19. However, there was little information provided for an entire country such as France, which was severely affected throughout the epidemic.
Methods
In France, the SNDS, comprising all health insurance reimbursements and benefits, and the PMSI, comprising hospital data, can be used to estimate the risk associated with about fifty diseases or health conditions for hospitalization primarily related to COVID-19 and COVID-19-related deaths. A cohort was constituted comprising all people alive on February 15, 2020. Data were censored at 15 June 2020 for COVID-19-related hospitalization and at 15 July 2020 for death for patients still hospitalized for COVID-19 on 15 June 2020. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for the associations between each comorbidity (n=47) and the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death. These associations were determined with adjustment for age and gender, and then in models including all variables (adjusted hazard ratios [aHR]).
Findings
In a population of 66,050,090 people, 87,809 people (134 per 100,000) were hospitalized for COVID-19 between February 15, 2020 and June 15, 2020 and a subgroup of 15,661 people (24 per 100,000) died in hospital. A much higher risk was observed with increasing age, reaching a risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 more than five fold higher and a risk of COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality more than 100-fold higher in people aged 85 years and older (absolute risks of 750 and 268 per 100,000, respectively) compared to people aged 40 to 44 years. Men were at higher risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization aHR 1·38 [1·36-1·40]) and COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality (aHR 2·08 [2·01-2·16]) compared to women. Positive associations between social deprivation index and risk of COVID-19 were also observed. Almost all chronic health conditions were positively associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization and in-hospital mortality, with the exception of dyslipidaemia, which was negatively associated. The strongest associations for both COVID-19-related hospitalization and in-hospital mortality were observed in people with Down syndrome (7·0 [6·1-8·1] and 22·9 [17·1-30·7], respectively), mental retardation (3·8 [3·5-4·2] and 7·3 [6·1-8·8], respectively), kidney transplantation (4·6 [4·2-5·0] and 7·1 [6·0-8·4], respectively), lung transplantation (3·5 [2·4-5·3] and 6·2 [2·8-14·0], respectively) end-stage renal disease on dialysis (4·2 [3·9-4·4] and 4·7 [4·2-5·2], respectively) and active lung cancer (2·6 [2·4-2·8] and 4·0 [3·5-4·6], respectively).
Interpretation
This national cohort study confirms the associations with most diseases and health conditions in France and provides data on less frequent health conditions, which could be useful particularly to target priority populations during present and future vaccination campaigns.

AB  - Measles is a highly transmissible disease that requires high levels of vaccination coverage for control and elimination. Areas that are unable to achieve and maintain high coverage levels are at risk for measles outbreaks resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, pose a threat to the functioning of health systems by disrupting immunization services which can derail measles vaccination efforts. Efforts to bridge coverage gaps in immunization include the rapid return to fully functioning services as well as deploying supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), which are additional vaccination campaigns intended to catch-up children who have missed routine services. However, SIAs, which to date tend to be national efforts, can be difficult to mobilize quickly, resource-intensive, and even more challenging to deploy during a public health crisis. By mapping expected burden of measles, more effective SIAs that are setting-specific and resource-efficient can be planned and mobilized. Using a spatial transmission model of measles dynamics, we projected and estimated the expected burden of national and local measles outbreaks in Zambia with the current COVID-19 pandemic as a framework to inform disruptions to routine vaccination. We characterize the impact of disruptions to routine immunization services on measles incidence, map expected case burden, and explore SIA strategies to mitigate measles outbreaks. We find that disruptions lasting six months or longer as well as having low MCV1 coverage prior to disruptions resulted in an observable increase of measles cases across provinces. Targeting provinces at higher risk of measles outbreaks for SIAs is an effective strategy to curb measles virus incidence following disruptions to routine immunization services.

AB  - Objectives
To examine the impact of COVID-19 on clinical health outcomes and health-related social needs among Medicaid-Medicare dual-eligible beneficiaries.
Design
Scoping review.
Setting and Participants
Dual eligibles during COVID-19.
Methods
We performed a comprehensive scoping review including observational studies, clinical trials, and original empirical research studies of PubMed and CINAHL. We generated a list of terms related to programs that both serve dual eligibles and address our desired outcomes. With the assistance of a medical librarian, we identified relevant abstracts published during COVID-19 meeting our inclusion criteria. We performed full-text reviews of relevant abstracts and selected the final studies. We extracted the study population, design, and major findings, then conducted thematic analysis.
Results
1100 articles were identified, with 439 deemed relevant. On full text-review, 15 articles met inclusion criteria representing more than 86 million Medicare beneficiaries. No studies were specific only to dual eligibles. Topic areas included in this review include COVID-19 case counts (2 articles), mortality (8 articles), hospitalizations (7 articles), food insecurity (1 article), self-reported mental health (1 article), and social connectedness (2 articles). Dual eligibles had disparate COVID-19–related outcomes from Medicare-only enrollees in 12 of 15 studies. Studies show higher mortality for dual eligibles overall, but this was not true for dual eligibles in nursing homes and assisted living communities. Dual eligibles were more likely to experience food insecurity. More favorably, dual eligibles reported greater social connectedness.
Conclusions and Implications
Dual eligibles had different outcomes from Medicare-only recipients in multiple health outcomes and health-related social needs during COVID-19, but studies are limited, particularly in terms of health-related social needs. Future work focusing on outcomes only among dual-eligible beneficiaries, integrated care programs, and fiscal alignment between Medicare and Medicaid plans may help stakeholders address health needs specific to dual eligibles.

AB  - Diabetes, one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world, is strongly associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Scrupulous blood sugar management is crucial, since the worse outcomes are closely associated with higher blood sugar levels in COVID-19 infection. Although recent observational studies showed that insulin was associated with mortality, it should not deter insulin use in hospitalized patients requiring tight glucose control. Back and forth dilemma in the past with regards to continue/discontinue certain medications used in diabetes have been mostly resolved. The initial fears of consequences related to continuing certain medications have been largely dispelled. COVID-19 also necessitates the transformation in diabetes care through the integration of technologies. Recent advances in health-related technologies, notably telemedicine and remote continuous glucose monitoring, have become essential in the management of diabetes during the pandemic. Today, these technologies have changed the landscape of medicine and become more important than ever. Being a high-risk population, patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, should be prioritized for vaccination. In the future, as the pandemic fades, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases is expected to rise due to lifestyle changes and medical issues/dilemma encountered during the pandemic.

AB  - Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on cardiac surgery patients. Significant reductions in access to surgical treatment have forced surgeons to prioritise patients and follow strict COVID-19 protocols to protect surgeons, staff, and patients. Adult cardiac surgery and the COVID-19 pandemic: aggressive infection mitigation strategies are necessary in the operating room and surgical recovery. Nosocomial infections among cardiac surgery patients have been reported and are associated with a high mortality rate. As a COVID-19 tertiary care centre and a tertiary cardiac centre, we tried to balance the need to operate on urgent cardiac cases while protecting patients and staff from COVID-19.
Methods
During the first wave of the pandemic, we performed 579 surgeries. We report findings from an outbreak of 4 nosocomial infections.
Results
All patients tested negative within 24 hours of surgery or admission. Three patients were positive after surgery, suggesting an overall nosocomial rate during the first wave of 0.5% (3/579). One patient admitted for evaluation tested positive during mass screening. Two of the 4 patients died after respiratory complications. No health care worker (HCW) or family member with direct contact with these patients tested positive for COVID-19. Nosocomial COVID-19 infection is uncommon when adhering to safety protocols. Although uncommon, the mortality rate is high (50%) in our series.
Conclusions
As widespread vaccination of HCWs and high-risk individuals susceptible to COVID-19 is in progress, we suggest that cardiac surgery patients, when feasible, be vaccinated before surgery given this could prevent excess mortality, protect HCWs and reduce resource use.
Résumé
Contexte
La pandémie de COVID-19 a eu des répercussions importantes sur les patients en chirurgie cardiaque. Les réductions importantes de l'accès aux traitements chirurgicaux ont obligé les chirurgiens à classer les patients par ordre de priorité et à suivre des protocoles COVID-19 rigoureux pour protéger les chirurgiens, le personnel et les patients. En ce qui a trait à la chirurgie cardiaque chez les adultes pendant la pandémie de COVID-19, des stratégies énergiques d'atténuation des infections sont nécessaires en salle d'opération et pendant la convalescence. Des infections nosocomiales ont été signalées chez des patients de chirurgie cardiaque; elles sont associées à un taux de mortalité élevé. Comme notre centre de soins tertiaires traite à la fois des patients atteints de troubles cardiaques et des patients atteints de la COVID-19, nous avons essayé de trouver un équilibre entre la nécessité d'effectuer les opérations cardiaques urgentes et la protection des patients et du personnel contre la COVID-19.
Méthodologie
Pendant la première vague de la pandémie, nous avons effectué 579 interventions chirurgicales. Nous rapportons les résultats d'une éclosion de quatre infections nosocomiales.
Résultats
Tous les patients ont obtenu un résultat négatif au test de dépistage dans les 24 heures suivant l'intervention ou l'admission. Trois patients ont obtenu un résultat positif à ce test après l'intervention, ce qui indique un taux global d'infection nosocomiale de 0,5 % (3 / 579) au cours de la première vague. Un patient admis pour évaluation a obtenu un résultat positif au moment du dépistage de masse. Deux des quatre patients sont morts après des complications respiratoires. Aucun travailleur de la santé ou membre de la famille ayant eu un contact direct avec ces patients n'a obtenu un résultat positif au test de dépistage de la COVID-19. L'infection nosocomiale à la COVID-19 est rare quand les protocoles de sécurité sont respectés. Mais même si elle est peu fréquente, le taux de mortalité associé est élevé (50 %) dans notre série.
Conclusions
Alors que la vaccination généralisée des travailleurs de la santé et des personnes à haut risque vulnérables à la COVID-19 est en cours, nous suggérons que les patients en chirurgie cardiaque soient vaccinés avant l'opération, si possible, car cela pourrait prévenir la surmortalité, protéger les travailleurs de la santé et réduire l'utilisation des ressources.

AB  - Background
Obesity is a risk factor for COVID-19. However, it is unknown whether weight changes can alter this risk. We investigated the association of weight changes with SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute severe COVID-19 outcomes occurring within two months of the infection.
Methods
We used 6.3 million nationwide cohort. The body weight was classified as follows: (1) underweight, body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m2; (2) normal, BMI 18.5–22.9 kg/m2; (3) overweight, BMI 23–24.9 kg/m2; (4) obese, BMI≥ 25 kg/m2. Weight changes were defined by comparing the classification of body weight during the health screening period I and II. The outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes within two months after the infection. The association was evaluated using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. The following covariates were adjusted: age, sex, household income, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, Charlson comorbidity index score, and dose of all COVID-19 vaccinations prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Results
Of the 2119,460 study participants, 184,204 were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Weight gain showed a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in underweight to normal and normal to overweight groups. Conversely, weight loss showed a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in normal to underweight, overweight to underweight, overweight to normal, obese to normal, and obese to overweight groups. In addition, weight gain revealed a higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, whereas weight loss showed a lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes.
Conclusion
This study found that weight loss and gain are associated with a lower and higher risk of both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes, respectively. Healthy weight management may be beneficial against the risk of COVID-19.

KW  - COVID-19 screening

KW  - Screening hesitancy
KW  - Voluntary rapid antigen test
AB  - Background
The Hong Kong government distributed rapid antigen test (RAT) kits to households across the city and called for a universal voluntary testing exercise for three consecutive days during the Omicron wave to identify infected persons early for quarantine and disrupt transmission chains in the community. We conducted a survey to evaluate the participation rates and explore the determinants of voluntary RAT adoption and hesitancy.
Methods
This cross-sectional survey was conducted through computer-assisted telephone interviews from 19 May to 16 June 2022 using an overlapping dual-frame telephone number sampling design. Information on willingness to adopt voluntary RAT, four themes of personal qualities, attitudes toward the government’s health policies, incentives to motivate RAT adoption, and personal sociodemographic factors were collected. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the factors associated with RAT adoption.
Results
Of the 1010 participants, 490 successfully responded to the fixed-line and 520 to the mobile phone survey, with response rates of 1.42% and 1.63% and screen hesitancy rates of 36.1% and 39.3%, respectively. Participants of adoption RAT were those aged 30–49 years, with high perceived COVID-19 infection severity, ≥ 3 doses of COVID-19 vaccination, and more agreement with the health policies on material resources and quarantine orders. Individuals who were less risk seeking and more altruistic reported a higher adoption of voluntary RAT.
Conclusions
Understanding the willingness to participate in a voluntary universal testing programme might shed light on effective ways to minimise screening hesitancy in future public health strategies and campaigns.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 initially infects cells in the nasopharynx and oral cavity. The immune system at these mucosal sites plays a crucial role in minimizing viral transmission and infection. To develop new strategies for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, this study aimed to identify proteins that protect against viral infection in saliva. We collected 551 saliva samples from 290 healthcare workers who had tested positive for COVID-19, before vaccination, between June and December 2020. The samples were categorized based on their ability to block or enhance infection using in vitro assays. Mass spectrometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments were used to identify and measure the abundance of proteins that specifically bind to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Immunoglobulin (Ig)A specific to SARS-CoV-2 antigens was detectable in over 83% of the convalescent saliva samples. We found that concentrations of anti-receptor-binding domain IgA >500 pg/µg total protein in saliva correlate with reduced viral infectivity in vitro. However, there is a dissociation between the salivary IgA response to SARS-CoV-2, and systemic IgG titers in convalescent COVID-19 patients. Then, using an innovative technique known as spike-baited mass spectrometry, we identified novel spike-binding proteins in saliva, most notably vimentin, which correlated with increased viral infectivity in vitro and could serve as a therapeutic target against COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
Background
COVID-19 pandemic research efforts have focused on disease phenotypes in adults. A distinct spectrum of illness has been documented in paediatric populations. We aimed to review paediatric intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in Australia, across differing variant predominant phases of the pandemic.
Methods
Data reported to the Short PeRiod IncideNce sTudy of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SPRINT-SARI) Australia, across 49 ICUs from February 2020 to June 2022 were extracted. We defined ‘child’ as patients aged <12 years, ‘adolescent’ as patients aged 12–17 years, and ‘young adult’ as patients aged 18–25 years.
Findings
We identified 226 paediatric ICU admissions with COVID-19, representing 3.9% of ICU admissions across the study period. Comorbidity was present in 34.6% of children, 51.4% of adolescents, and 48.7% of young adults. The need for respiratory support was highest in young adults. While 28.3% of patients <18 years required invasive ventilation, in-hospital mortality in paediatric patients was 3.6%. During the Omicron period, there was an increase in the annualised incidence of age-specific COVID-19 ICU admissions per 100,000 population, albeit a decrease in the incidence per 1000 SARS-CoV-2 notifications.
Interpretation
This study demonstrated an appreciable burden of COVID-19 in paediatric patients. Adolescent patients presented phenotypically similar to young adults, however, illness severity was lower in younger cohorts. The Omicron phase of the pandemic demonstrated an increased age-specific population incidence of COVID-19 ICU admissions, albeit a reduced incidence when based on SARS-CoV-2 notifications.
Funding
SPRINT-SARI Australia is supported by the Department of Health, Commonwealth of Australia [Standing Deed SON60002733].

AB  - ABSTRACT
Importance
On an ecological scale, the lag time between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and related fatality has varied between epidemic waves and prefectures in Japan. The variability in lag time across areas of Japan during the seven distinct waves can help derive a more appropriate estimation of the weekly confirmed case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19.
Objective
To estimate the 7-day moving average CFR across area block levels in Japan from February 2020 to July 2022 using the lag time between COVID-19 infection and related fatality.
Main outcomes and measures
The 7-day moving average CFR of COVID-19 for area blocks in Japan considering the lag time between infection and death (total and subgroup analysis of elderly).
Results
Lag time was found to vary substantially among prefectures in Japan from the first wave to the seventh wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. The estimated 7-day moving average CFR based on the lag time reflects the Japanese COVID-19 pandemic and related policy interventions (e.g. vaccination of elderly people) rather than other standard CFR estimations.
Conclusions and relevance
The variation in estimated lag time across prefectures in Japan for different epidemic waves indicates that it is inadequate to use the clinical results of the period from the start of infection to death for evaluation of the ecological scale of the CFR. Moreover, the lag time between infection and related fatality was found to be either shorter or longer than the clinically reported period. This revealed that preliminary reports of CFR may be overestimated or underestimated, even if they consider the lag based on clinical reports.

AB  - The rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus and its high death rate have surprised many countries around the world. In such a situation, a lack of proper positioning against this disaster can lead to irreparable and long-term damages. Through designing a comparative interdependent platform in two phases of COVID-19's outbreak-epidemic and pandemic, this paper investigates the positioning of 8 African countries, including Egypt, South Africa, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Nigeria, Cameroon, and Kenya, based on the composite indices of social permeability, coping potential and social vulnerability. Further, using the k-means approach, the under-study countries are involved in some dominant clusters by which their surrounding features compared to each other are implied. To reduce the risk arising from disasters such as COVID-19, the decision tree method is taken to extract patterns indicating the risk of vulnerability in the future. The results of the carried out analyses prove that Algeria has the most preferable position in the social permeability index and Tunisia has the most coping potential compared to other countries. On the other hand, Cameroon and Egypt have had relatively less vulnerability in dealing with COVID-19, which can lead to valuable management perspectives. The performed clustering depicts that the dominant clusters include 0–1) Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia, 2–4) South Africa, 1-2-4) Algeria, and 3) Nigeria, Kenya, and Cameroon. Tracing the branches of the decision tree can also facilitate achieving different vulnerability ranges and guide the adoption of appropriate policies to balance the influencing factors and reduce their adverse effects.

AB  - Background
It is evident that COVID-19 will remain a public health concern in the coming years, largely driven by variants of concern (VOC). It is critical to continuously monitor vaccine effectiveness as new variants emerge and new vaccines and/or boosters are developed. Systematic surveillance of the scientific evidence base is necessary to inform public health action and identify key uncertainties. Evidence syntheses may also be used to populate models to fill in research gaps and help to prepare for future public health crises. This protocol outlines the rationale and methods for a living evidence synthesis of the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with, and transmission of, VOC of SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
Living evidence syntheses of vaccine effectiveness will be carried out over one year for (1) a range of potential outcomes in the index individual associated with VOC (pathogenesis); and (2) transmission of VOC. The literature search will be conducted up to May 2023. Observational and database-linkage primary studies will be included, as well as RCTs. Information sources include electronic databases (MEDLINE; Embase; Cochrane, L*OVE; the CNKI and Wangfang platforms), pre-print servers (medRxiv, BiorXiv), and online repositories of grey literature. Title and abstract and full-text screening will be performed by two reviewers using a liberal accelerated method. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be completed by one reviewer with verification of the assessment by a second reviewer. Results from included studies will be pooled via random effects meta-analysis when appropriate, or otherwise summarized narratively.
Discussion
Evidence generated from our living evidence synthesis will be used to inform policy making, modelling, and prioritization of future research on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against VOC.

AB  - Objectives
In this study we evaluate the efficacy and safety of a treatment protocol with standard dose of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective analysis to compare the 28-day mortality rate in 352 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin (HCQ-group) in our hospital with a contemporary control group of 3533 patients receiving standard of care from the Belgian Collaborative Group on COVID-19 Hospital Surveillance.
Results
All patients who received at least one dose of treatment were included in the analysis. A statistically significant reduction in crude mortality rate at 28 days was observed in the HCQ-group compared to standard of care (16.8% vs 25.9%,p ​= ​0.001). Patients in the treatment group were on average younger (69,7 vs73,1 years, p ​= ​0,0002), were less likely to smoke or to have malignancy and more likely to be male. Patients in the treatment group were more likely to be obese, immunocompromised or to have arterial hypertension, liver disease and lung disease. After adjustment for these variables the OR for mortality was 0.635 (95%CI 0.464–0.875). Patients who did not receive HCQ had a 57% higher risk of mortality. A survival benefit in the treatment group was consistent across all age groups. 13 patients discontinued treatment due to side effects (4 with QTc-prolongation>60msec (1.1%) and 9 because of gastro-intestinal symptoms (2.55%)). No episodes of ventricular arrhythmia or torsade de pointes were recorded during treatment.
Conclusion
Treatment of COVID-19 using a combination of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin was safe and was associated with a statistically significant mortality benefit in the treatment of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized patients. Our findings do not support the current negative recommendations regarding this treatment.

AB  - Background
Russia has been portrayed in media as having one of the highest death tolls due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the world. However, the precise scale of excess mortality is still unclear. We provide the first estimates of excess mortality in Russia as a whole and its regions in 2020, placing this in an international context.
Methods
We used monthly death rates for Russia and 83 regions plus the equivalent for 36 comparator countries. Expected mortality was derived in two ways using averages in the same months in preceding years and the same averages adjusted for secular trends. Excess death rates were estimated for the whole year and the last 3 quarters. We also estimated the relationships between excess mortality and reported COVID-19 cases and deaths across countries and Russian regions.
Results
Estimating excess deaths rates based on the trend-adjusted average, Russia had the highest excess mortality of any of the 37 countries considered. Using the simple average, Russia had the third highest. Most of the excess deaths were recorded in the 4th quarter of 2020 and the level and trajectory of excess mortality in Russia and most of Eastern European countries differed from that in Western countries. While both the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and deaths showed positive correlations with excess mortality across countries (r=0.65 and r=0.75, p<0.001), the association across the Russian regions was, surprisingly, negative for cases (r=-0.34, p<0.01) and deaths (r=-0.09, p=0.42). When we replaced reported deaths with final data from death certificates the correlation was positive (r=0.38, p<0.001).
Conclusion
Russia has one of the largest absolute burden of excess mortality in 2020 but there is a counter-intuitive negative association between excess mortality and cumulative incidence at the regional level. Under-recording of COVID-19 cases seems to be a problem in some regions.

KW  - Asia
AB  - Background and aims
COVID-19 is a pandemic that has affected beyond 100 million and caused nearly 3 million deaths globally. Vitamin D is a known risk factor for COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association of prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D level with COVID-19 infection and mortality in Asia, predicting with other confounding factors such as median age, obesity, and diabetes.
Methods
COVID-19 infections and mortalities among the Asian countries were retrieved from the Worldometer website. Information on prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D values in each Asian country was retrieved through literature searching on PubMed® and Google scholar. The associations between COVID-19 infections and mortalities with prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D level were explored with correlation coefficients. As a predictive analysis, multiple linear regression was carried out with all confounders.
Results
Positive correlations were observed for prevalence of vitamin D deficiency with COVID-19 infections (r = 0.55; p = 0.01; R2 = 0.31) and mortalities (r = 0.50; p = 0.01; R2 = 0.25). Moreover, the associations for the COVID-19 infections and mortalities improved to r = 0.76 (p = 0.002; R2 = 0.58) and r = 0.65 (p = 0.03; R2 = 0.42), respectively, after predicting with confounding factors. Similarly, mean vitamin D level had a significant negative correlation with COVID-19 infections (r = −0.77; p = 0.04; R2 = 0.59) and mortalities (r = −0.80; p = 0.03; R2 = 0.63) when combining with confounders.
Conclusion
Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is significantly positively associated whereas the mean vitamin D level is significantly negatively associated with both infection and mortality rate of COVID-19 among Asian countries upon predicting with all confounders.

AB  - Patients with cancer have a well-known and higher risk of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). VPDs may cause severe complications in this setting due to immune system impairment, malnutrition and oncological treatments. Despite this evidence, vaccination rates are inadequate. The Italian Association of Medical Oncology [Associazione Italiana di Oncologia Medica (AIOM)] has been involved in vaccination awareness since 2014. Based on a careful review of the available data about the immunogenicity, effectiveness and safety of flu, pneumococcal and anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, we report the recommendations of the AIOM about these vaccinations in adult patients with solid tumors. The AIOM recommends comprehensive education on the issue of VPDs. We believe that a multidisciplinary care model may improve the vaccination coverage in immunocompromised patients. Continued surveillance, implementation of preventive practices and future well-designed immunological prospective studies are essential for better management of our patients with cancer.

AB  - Background
Persons with COVID-19 infection have an increased risk of pregnancy-related complications. However, data on acute cardiovascular (CV) complications during delivery admissions remain limited.
Objectives
The purpose of this study was to determine whether pregnant individuals with COVID-19 have an increased risk of acute peripartum CV complications during their delivery admission.
Methods
This population-based retrospective cohort study used the 2020 National Inpatient Sample database. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes were used to identify delivery admissions with a diagnosis of COVID-19. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to determine the association between COVID-19 and acute peripartum CV complications at delivery.
Results
A total of 3,458,691 weighted delivery admissions were identified, of which 1.3% were among persons with COVID-19 (n = 46,375). Persons with COVID-19 were younger (median 28 vs 29 years, P < 0.01) and had a higher prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm births, and Cesarean delivery (P < 0.01). After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, insurance, and income, COVID-19 remained independently associated with peripartum CV complications including preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.33 [95% CI, 1.29-1.37]), peripartum cardiomyopathy (aOR: 2.09 [1.54-2.84]), acute coronary syndrome (aOR: 12.94 [8.85-18.90]), and arrhythmias (aOR: 1.55 [1.45-1.67]), compared with no COVID-19. Likewise, the risks of in-hospital mortality, acute kidney injury, stroke, pulmonary edema, and venous thromboembolism were higher with COVID-19. For resource utilization, the cost of hospitalization ($5,374 vs $4,837, P < 0.01) was higher for deliveries among persons with COVID-19.
Conclusions
In the year 2020, pregnant persons with COVID-19 had a higher risk of preeclampsia, in-hospital mortality, and other serious CV complication during delivery hospitalizations compared to pregnant individuals without COVID-19.

AB  - Governments implemented countermeasures to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. This had a severe effect on the economy. We examine convergence patterns in the evolution of COVID-19 deaths across countries. We aim to investigate whether countries that implemented different measures managed to limit the number of COVID-19 deaths. We extend the most recent macro-growth convergence methodology to examine convergence of COVID-19 deaths. We combine a long memory stationarity framework with the maximal clique algorithm. This provides a rich and flexible club formation strategy that goes beyond the stationary/non stationary approach adopted in the previous literature. Our results suggest that strict measures (even belated) or an aggressive vaccination scheme can confine the spread of the disease while maintaining the strictness of the measures steady can lead to a burst of the virus. Finally, we observe that fiscal measures did not have an effect on the containment of the virus.

AB  - Objective
Our aim in this study was to determine the reasons for hospitalization in Australian people with diabetes who contract COVID-19.
Methods
All COVID-19 cases reported to the Victorian Department of Health and linked hospitalization data were assessed. We determined reasons for acute (0 to 30 days) and postacute (31 to 365 days) hospitalization among those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and COVID-19, compared to those with COVID-19 and no diabetes, and to admissions before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Results
Australians (N=13,302) with type 1 or type 2 diabetes were hospitalized in the state of Victoria in the 12 months after COVID-19 diagnosis. Respiratory diseases accounted for 40% of acute admissions among those with diabetes. Viral pneumonia was the leading cause of acute hospitalization among those with diabetes and constituted a larger proportion of admissions in those with compared to those without diabetes (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.87, 95% confidence interval 1.76 to 1.99). The distribution of postacute hospitalizations among those with diabetes aligned with that of people with diabetes before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conclusions
Respiratory diseases are the leading cause of acute hospitalization in those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and COVID-19. The reasons for postacute hospitalization resemble those in people with diabetes and no COVID-19. We reinforce the importance of community management of people with diabetes in the ongoing pandemic.
Résumé
Objectif
Déterminer les causes d'hospitalisation chez les personnes atteintes de diabète qui contractent la COVID-19.
Méthodes
Nous avons analysé tous les cas de COVID-19 signalés au Département de la Santé de l'État de Victoria et les avons associés aux données d'hospitalisation. Nous avons déterminé les causes d’hospitalisations aiguës (0-30 jours) et post-aiguës (31-365 jours) chez les personnes atteintes de diabète de type 1 ou de type 2 et de COVID-19, en les comparant à celles des personnes atteintes de COVID-19 sans diabète, ainsi qu'aux admissions antérieures à la pandémie de COVID-19.
Résultats
13,302 Australiens atteints de diabète de type 1 ou de type 2 ont été hospitalisés dans l'État de Victoria au cours des 12 mois suivant le diagnostic de COVID-19. Les maladies respiratoires représentaient 40% des admissions aiguës chez les personnes atteintes de diabète. La pneumonie virale était la raison première d'une hospitalisation aiguë chez les personnes atteintes de diabète et représentait une plus grande proportion des admissions chez les personnes atteintes de diabète par rapport à celles sans diabète (RP ajusté 1.87, IC à 95 % 1.76 – 1.99). La répartition des hospitalisations en phase post-aiguës chez les personnes atteintes de diabète correspondait à celle des personnes atteintes de diabète avant la pandémie de COVID-19.
Conclusion
Les maladies respiratoires représentent la principale raison d'une hospitalisation aiguë chez les personnes atteintes de diabète de type 1 ou de type 2 et de COVID-19. Les raisons associées à une hospitalisation en phase post-aiguë sont semblables à celles des personnes atteintes de diabète en absence de COVID-19. Nous soulignons l'importance de la prise en charge communautaire des personnes atteintes de diabète dans le contexte de la pandémie actuelle.

AB  - There is a marked variation in mortality risk associated with COVID-19 infection in the general population. Low socioeconomic status and other social determinants have been discussed as possible causes for the higher burden in African American communities compared with white communities. Beyond the social determinants, the biochemical mechanism that predisposes individual subjects or communities to the development of excess and serious complications associated with COVID-19 infection is not clear. Virus infection triggers massive ROS production and oxidative damage. Glutathione (GSH) is essential and protects the body from the harmful effects of oxidative damage from excess reactive oxygen radicals. GSH is also required to maintain the VD-metabolism genes and circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)VD). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is necessary to prevent the exhaustion and depletion of cellular GSH. X-linked genetic G6PD deficiency is common in the AA population and predominantly in males. Acquired deficiency of G6PD has been widely reported in subjects with conditions of obesity and diabetes. This suggests that individuals with G6PD deficiency are vulnerable to excess oxidative stress and at a higher risk for inadequacy or deficiency of 25(OH)VD, leaving the body unable to protect its ‘oxidative immune-metabolic’ physiological functions from the insults of COVID-19. An association between subclinical interstitial lung disease with 25(OH)VD deficiencies and GSH deficiencies has been previously reported. We hypothesize that the overproduction of ROS and excess oxidative damage is responsible for the impaired immunity, secretion of the cytokine storm, and onset of pulmonary dysfunction in response to the COVID-19 infection. The co-optimization of impaired glutathione redox status and excess 25(OH)VD deficiencies has the potential to reduce oxidative stress, boost immunity, and reduce the adverse clinical effects of COVID-19 infection in the AA population.

AB  - The objective of this systematic review is to give a comprehensive interpretation of menstrual cycle changes after the COVID-19 vaccination. Additionally, it is imperative to assess reports of menstrual changes following vaccination to dispel concerns that COVID-19 vaccines hinder the likelihood of pregnancy in the long run. A literature review was conducted using digital databases to systematically identify the studies reporting any menstrual abnormalities after the COVID-19 vaccine. Detailed patient-level study characteristics including the type of study, sample size, administered vaccines, and menstrual abnormalities were abstracted. A total of 78 138 vaccinated females were included in this review from 14 studies. Of these, 39 759 (52.05%) had some form of a menstrual problem after vaccination. Due to the lack of published research articles, preprints were also included in this review. Menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and polymenorrhea were the most commonly observed problems and the overall study-level rate of menstrual abnormality ranged from 0.83% to 90.9%. Age, history of pregnancy, systemic side-effects of COVID-19, smoking, and second dose of COVID-19 vaccine were predictors of menstrual problems after vaccination.

Se realizó una revisión de la literatura utilizando bases de datos digitales para identificar sistemáticamente los estudios que reportan cualquier alteración menstrual tras la vacuna contra la COVID-19. Se resumieron las características detalladas del estudio al nivel del paciente, incluyendo tipo de estudio, tamaño de la muestra, vacunas administradas, y alteraciones menstruales. Se incluyó en la revisión a un total de 78 138 mujeres vacunadas, procedentes de 14 estudios. De ellas, 39 759 (52,05%) tuvieron algún tipo de problema menstrual tras la vacunación. Debido a la falta de artículos de investigación publicados, también se incluyeron preimpresos en esta revisión. Menorragia, metrorragia, y polimenorrea fueron los problemas más comúnmente observados, oscilando la tasa global de alteraciones menstruales a nivel de estudios entre el 0,83 y el 90,9%. La edad, los antecedentes de embarazos, los efectos secundarios sistémicos de la COVID-19, el tabaquismo y la segunda dosis de la vacuna contra la COVID-19 fueron factores predictivos de problemas menstruales tras la vacunación.

AB  - Summary
Although the global COVID-19 pandemic response was quick to develop medical countermeasures, it failed to fully prevent morbidity and mortality in high-income countries and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). As new variants and post-COVID-19 condition continue to emerge and affect health systems and economies, the full human and economic cost is yet to be felt. We should now learn from these shortcomings and implement more inclusive and equitable frameworks to prevent and respond to outbreaks. This Series offers specific learnings from COVID-19 vaccination campaigns and non-pharmaceutical interventions, highlighting the need for resilient, inclusive, and equitable health systems. Taking action to rebuild trust and invest in resilient local manufacturing capacity, supply chains, regulatory frameworks, and placing LMIC voices at the centre of decision making will help to ensure preparedness for future threats. It is time to move beyond mere talk of learning and implementing lessons and instead take action towards a more resilient future.

AB  - Public experiences of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown differed dramatically between countries and socio-economic groups. Low-income countries raise unique empirical and ethical concerns about (1) the balance between benefits and social harms and (2) how explanatory disease models and everyday life realities influenced the experience and interpretation of lockdown itself. In this paper, we present qualitative data on community perceptions and experiences of the pandemic from a remote area of Haiti, with a focus on the 2020 lockdown. We conducted in-depth interviews with 30 community leaders in Grand’Anse Department, southwest Haiti, at two time periods: May 2020 and October–December 2021. We divide our results into five sections. First, our analysis showed that lockdown was widely considered ineffective at controlling COVID-19. Despite the lack of testing, community leaders believed most of the local population had caught COVID-19 in the first half of 2020, with limited reported mortality. Public concern about the pandemic largely ended at this time, overtaken by other socio-economic and political crises. Second, we found that popular explanations for the low fatality rate were related to various coping strategies: the strength of people's immune systems, use of natural prophylactic folk teas, beliefs about the virus, spiritual protections and the tropical weather. Third, we found that lockdown was widely seen to have not been appropriate for the Haitian context due to various challenges with compliance in the face of socio-economic vulnerability. Fourth, we found strong negative feelings about the social consequences of lockdown measures, which lasted from March–August 2020, including adverse effects on: food security, household income, education, health, and psychosocial well-being. Finally, these perceptions and experiences reinforced popular ideas that lockdown had been imposed by elites for financial and/or political gain, something that was also reflected in the discourse about the low vaccine acceptance rate. Our study showed that pandemic respiratory virus response in Haiti should better balance restrictive non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) with existing socio-economic vulnerability. Local socio-behavioral dynamics and risk perceptions decrease the overall effectiveness of NPIs in fragile states and alternatives to lockdown, such as shielding the most vulnerable, are likely to be a more appropriate strategy.

AB  - Introduction
Novel strategies are needed to address barriers to COVID-19 vaccination among people experiencing homelessness (PEH), a population that faces increased COVID-19 risk. Although growing evidence suggests that financial incentives for vaccination are acceptable to PEH, their impact on uptake is unknown. This study aimed to assess whether offering $50 gift cards was associated with the uptake of the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine among PEH in Los Angeles County.
Methods
Vaccination clinics began on March 15, 2021; the financial incentive program was implemented from September 26, 2021 to April 30, 2022. Interrupted time-series analysis with quasi-Poisson regression was used to evaluate the level and slope change in the number of weekly first doses administered. Time-varying confounders included the weekly number of clinics and the weekly number of new cases. Demographic characteristics were compared for PEH vaccinated before and after the implementation of the incentive program using chi-square tests.
Results
Offering financial incentives was associated with the administration of 2.5 times (95% CI=1.8, 3.1) more first doses than would have been expected without the program. Level (–0.184, 95% CI= –1.166, –0.467) and slope change (0.042, 95% CI=0.031, 0.053) were observed. Individuals who were unsheltered, aged <55 years, and identified as Black or African American accounted for a higher percentage of those vaccinated during the post-intervention period than during the pre-intervention period.
Conclusions
Financial incentives may be an effective tool for increasing vaccine uptake among PEH, but important ethical considerations must be made to avoid coercion of vulnerable populations.

AB  - Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines might have increased the incidence of giant-cell arteritis (GCA) and the risk of associated stroke in Spain.
Methods
Retrospective nation-wide observational analysis of all adults hospitalized with GCA in Spain during 5 years (Jan-2016 and Dec-2021). The incidence and proportion of admissions with or because of GCA and GCA-associated stroke were compared between pre-pandemic (2016–2019) and pandemic (2020 and 2021) years. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the different COVID-19 waves and vaccine timing schedules.
Results
A total of 17,268 hospital admissions in patients diagnosed with GCA were identified. During 2020 there were 79.3 and 8.1 per 100,000 admissions of GCA and GCA-associated stroke, respectively. During 2021 these figures were 80.8 and 7.7 per 100,00 admissions, respectively. As comparison, yearly admissions due to GCA and GCA-associated stroke were 72.4 and 5.7 per 100,00, respectively, during the pre-pandemic period (p < 0.05). Coincident with the third wave of COVID-19 (and first vaccine dosing), the rate of GCA-associated stroke admissions increased significantly (from 6.7 to 12%; p < 0.001). Likewise, there was an increase in GCA-associated stroke (6.6% vs 4.1%, p = 0.016) coincident with the third dose vaccination (booster) in patients older than 70 at the end of 2021. In multivariate analysis, only patients admitted during the third COVID-19 wave (and first vaccine dosing) (OR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.22–2.93), and during the third vaccination dosing in patients older than 70 (booster) (OR = 1.66, CI 1.11–2.49), presented a higher GCA-associated stroke risk than the same months of previous years after adjustment by age, sex, classical cardiovascular risk factors and COVID-19 diagnosis.
Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increased incidence of GCA during 2020 and 2021. Moreover, the risk of associated stroke significantly risen accompanying times of COVID-19 vaccine dosing, hypothetically linked to an increased thrombotic risk of mRNA-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Hence, forthcoming vaccine policies and indications must weigh the risk of severe COVID-19 with the risk of flare or stroke in patients with GCA.

AB  - Background
Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) remains a global public health concern, and remdesivir plus dexamethasone combination therapy is suggested for patients with severe disease. However, the factors associated with poor outcomes in these patients remain unclear. We identified the factors associated with poor outcomes in Taiwanese patients with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir plus dexamethasone.
Methods
Adults with severe COVID-19 (oxygen saturation <94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen) treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone were identified between 1 May and 31 July 2021. The main outcomes were 14-day non-recovery, 28-day mortality, and progression to respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or death in initially non-ventilated patients. The prognostic factors associated with poor outcomes were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression and Cox regression.
Results
Of the 110 patients treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone, 57 (51.8%) recovered within 14 days and 6 (5.5%) died within 28 days. Of the 89 initially non-ventilated patients, 12 (13.5%) progressed to respiratory failure or death. Charlson Comorbidity Index, SOFA score, and admission to remdesivir treatment interval were associated with 14-day non-recovery. C-reactive protein level was associated with 28-day mortality. Pneumonia Severity Index and admission to remdesivir treatment interval were associated with progression to respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or death in initially non-ventilated patients.
Conclusion
High disease severity on admission and delayed initiation of remdesivir therapy were associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has now killed 1 of every 303 Americans. Whereas 4 vaccines are approved in the United States and masks are widely available, too few are fully immunized and most of the population has stopped wearing protective masks. The ongoing consequences of this include continued excess morbidity and mortality and the generation of immune-evading variants and subvariants, which in toto are injurious and ultimately self-defeating. Herein we briefly update and review COVID-19 vaccines, waning immunity, and new variants.

AB  - Stress cardiomyopathy was noted to occur at a higher incidence during coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This database analysis has been done to compare the in-hospital outcomes in patients with stress cardiomyopathy and concurrent COVID-19 infection with those without COVID-19 infection. The National Inpatient Sample database for the year 2020 was queried to identify all admissions diagnosed with stress cardiomyopathy. These patients were then stratified based on whether they had concomitant COVID-19 infection or not. A 1:1 propensity score matching was performed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to identify predictors of mortality. We identified 41,290 hospitalizations for stress cardiomyopathy, including 1665 patients with concurrent diagnosis of COVID-19. The female preponderance was significantly lower in patients with stress cardiomyopathy and COVID-19. Patients with concomitant COVID-19 were more likely to be African American, diabetic and have chronic kidney disease. After propensity matching, the incidence of complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI), AKI requiring dialysis, coagulopathy, sepsis, cardiogenic shock, cases with prolonged intubation of >24 h, requirement of vasopressor and inpatient mortality, were noted to be significantly higher in patients with COVID-19. Concomitant COVID-19 infection was independently associated with worse outcomes and increased mortality in patients hospitalized with stress cardiomyopathy.

AB  - This paper introduces new methods to study the changing dynamics of COVID-19 cases and deaths among the 50 worst-affected countries throughout 2020. First, we analyse the trajectories and turning points of rolling mortality rates to understand at which times the disease was most lethal. We demonstrate five characteristic classes of mortality rate trajectories and determine structural similarity in mortality trends over time. Next, we introduce a class of virulence matrices to study the evolution of COVID-19 cases and deaths on a global scale. Finally, we introduce three-way inconsistency analysis to determine anomalous countries with respect to three attributes: countries’ COVID-19 cases, deaths and human development indices. We demonstrate the most anomalous countries across these three measures are Pakistan, the United States and the United Arab Emirates.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people and posed an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems and economies worldwide since the outbreak of the COVID-19. A considerable number of nations have investigated COVID-19 and proposed a series of prevention and treatment strategies thus far. The pandemic prevention strategies implemented in China have suggested that the spread of COVID-19 can be effectively reduced by restricting large-scale gathering, developing community-scale nucleic acid testing, and conducting epidemiological investigations, whereas sporadic cases have always been identified in numerous places. Currently, there is still no decisive therapy for COVID-19 or related complications. The development of COVID-19 vaccines has raised the hope for mitigating this pandemic based on the intercross immunity induced by COVID-19. Thus far, several types of COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and released to into financial markets. From the perspective of vaccine use in globe, COVID-19 vaccines are beneficial to mitigate the pandemic, whereas the relative adverse events have been reported progressively. This is a review about the development, challenges and prospects of COVID-19 vaccines, and it can provide more insights into all aspects of the vaccines.

Outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in long-term care facilities are associated with mortality, although vaccination have contributed to improvements. This study reports clinical impacts of a COVID-19 outbreak in a nursing home for elderly individuals in Kyoto City, Japan.
Methods
We performed epidemiologic and molecular investigations of the outbreak and characterized outcomes of the nursing home residents.
Results
During the outbreak period, a total of 31 residents (39.2%) and 26 staff members (49.1%) were infected with COVID-19. All residents and staff received two doses of a vaccine approximately 7 months prior. Ten residents with severe hypoxemia could not be transferred to a hospital due to a shortage of beds for COVID-19 patients. Within 90 days of the onset of the outbreak, 8 residents with COVID-19 (25.8%) died. A total of 48.4% of residents with COVID-19 developed 1 or more comorbidities. Viral genome analysis showed that the outbreak was caused by the Omicron BA.1.1.2 variant.
Conclusions
Despite vaccination, high mortality and morbidity were observed in the COVID-19 outbreak due to the Omicron variant. Limiting medical care for residents with COVID-19 in facilities that experience ongoing outbreaks may be needed to reduce the risk of mortality among nursing home residents.

AB  - Contact tracing is an important tool in managing infectious disease outbreaks and Ireland used a comprehensive contact tracing program to slow the spread of COVID-19. Although the benefits of contact tracing seem obvious, it is difficult to estimate the actual impact contact tracing has on an outbreak because it is hard to separate the effects of contact tracing from other behavioural changes or interventions. To understand the impact contact tracing had in Ireland, we used an agent-based model that is designed to simulate the spread of COVID-19 through Ireland. The model uses real contact tracing data from the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that without contact tracing, and everything else held constant, a larger number of cases, hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths would have occurred. The model suggests that without contact tracing deaths from COVID-19 in Ireland during the first year of the pandemic could have increased by 80% (this equates to approximately 5,768 agents in the model). This modelling study is an important step in highlighting the impact that contact tracing had on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we use a model for Ireland, this method is applicable to any country or region.

AB  - To contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries around the globe have adopted social distancing measures. Yet, establishing the causal effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is difficult because they do not occur arbitrarily. We exploit a quasi-random source of variation for identification purposes –namely, regional differences in the placement on the pandemic curve following an unexpected and nationwide lockdown. Our results reveal that regions where the outbreak had just started when the lockdown was implemented had 1.62 fewer daily deaths per 100,000 inhabitants when compared to regions for which the lockdown arrived 10+ days after the pandemic’s outbreak. As a result, a total of 4,642 total deaths (232 deaths/daily) could have been avoided by the end of our period of study –a figure representing 23% of registered deaths in Spain at the time. We rule out differential pre−COVID mortality trends and self-distancing behaviors across the compared regions prior to the swift lockdown, which was also uniformly observed nationwide. In addition, we provide supporting evidence for contagion deceleration as the main mechanism behind the effectiveness of the early adoption of NPIs in lowering the death rate, rather than an increased healthcare capacity.

AB  - Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly, giving rise to a pandemic, causing significant morbidity and mortality. In this context, many vaccines have emerged to try to deal with this disease.
Objective
To review the reported cases of neurological manifestations after the application of COVID-19 vaccines, describing clinical, analytical and neuroimaging findings and health outcomes.
Methods
We carried out a review through bibliographic searches in PubMed.
Results
We found 86 articles, including 13 809 patients with a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations temporally associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Most occurred in women (63.89%), with a median age of 50 years. The most frequently reported adverse events were Bell’s palsy 4936/13 809 (35.7%), headache (4067/13 809), cerebrovascular events 2412/13 809 (17.47%), Guillain-Barré syndrome 868/13 809 (6.28%), central nervous system demyelination 258/13 809 (1.86%) and functional neurological disorder 398/13 809 (2.88%). Most of the published cases occurred in temporal association with the Pfizer vaccine (BNT162b2), followed by the AstraZeneca vaccine (ChAdOX1-S).
Conclusions
It is not possible to establish a causal relationship between these adverse events and COVID-19 vaccines with the currently existing data, nor to calculate the frequency of appearance of these disorders. However, it is necessary for health professionals to be familiar with these events, facilitating their early diagnosis and treatment. Large controlled epidemiological studies are necessary to establish a possible causal relationship between vaccination against COVID-19 and neurological adverse events.

La mayoría ocurrieron en mujeres (63,89%), con una mediana de edad de 50 años. Los eventos adversos publicados con más frecuencia fueron parálisis facial de Bell 4936/13809 (35,7%), cefalea (4067/13809), eventos vasculares cerebrales 2412/13809 (17,47%), síndrome de Guillain-Barré 868/13809 (6,28%), desmielinización del sistema nervioso central 258/13809 (1,86%) y trastorno neurológico funcional 398/13809 (2,88%). La mayoría de casos publicados se produjeron en asociación temporal con la vacuna Pfizer (BNT162b2), seguida de la vacuna de AstraZeneca (ChAdOX1 nCoV-19).
Conclusiones
Con los datos existentes actualmente no es posible establecer una relación de causalidad entre estos eventos adversos y las vacunas contra COVID-19, ni calcular la frecuencia de aparición de estos trastornos. Sin embargo, es necesario que los profesionales de la salud estén familiarizados con estos eventos, facilitando su diagnóstico y tratamiento tempranos. Son necesarios grandes estudios epidemiológicos controlados para establecer una posible relación causal entre la vacunación contra COVID-19 y los eventos adversos neurológicos.

AB  - Objectives
This study aimed to estimate the burden of acute COVID-19 in Córdoba, one of the most affected departments (states) in Colombia, through the estimation of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
Methods
DALYs were estimated based on the number of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection cases reported by official Colombian sources. A transition probability matrix among severity states was calculated using data obtained from a retrospective cohort that included 1736 COVID-19 confirmed subjects living in Córdoba.
Results
Córdoba had 120.23 deaths per 100 000 habitants during the study period (March 2020 to April 2021). Estimated total DALYs were 49 243 (2692 DALYs per 100 000 inhabitants), mostly attributed to fatal cases (99.7%). On average, 25 years of life were lost because of death by this infection. A relevant proportion of years of life lost because of COVID-19 (46.6%) was attributable to people < 60 years old and was greater in men. People ≥ 60 years old showed greater risk of progression to critical state than people between the age of 35 and 60 years (hazard ratio 2.5; 95% confidence interval 2.5-12.5) and younger than 35 years (9.1; 95% confidence interval 4.0-20.6).
Conclusion
In Córdoba, premature mortality because of COVID-19 was substantially represented by people < 60 years old and was greater in males. Our data may be representative of Latin American populations with great infection spread during the first year of the pandemic and contribute to novel methodological aspects and parameter estimations that may be useful to measure COVID-19 burden in other countries of the region.
Resumen
Objetivos
Estimar la carga de COVID-19 aguda en Córdoba, uno de los departamentos (estados) más afectados de Colombia, a través de la estimación de años de vida ajustados por discapacidad (AVISAS).
Métodos
Los AVISAS se estimaron con base en el número de casos de infección por severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reportados por fuentes oficiales colombianas. Se calculó una matriz de probabilidad de transición entre estados de gravedad a partir de los datos obtenidos de una cohorte retrospectiva que incluyó a 1.736 sujetos confirmados con COVID-19 residentes en Córdoba.
Resultados
Córdoba tuvo 120,23 defunciones por cada 100.000 habitantes durante el periodo de estudio (marzo de 2020 a abril de 2021). Los AVISAS totales estimados fueron 49.243 (2.692 AV por 100.000 habitantes), en su mayoría atribuidos a los casos mortales (99,7%). En promedio, se perdieron 25 años de vida debido a las muertes secundarias a esta infección. Una proporción relevante de años de vida perdidos a causa de la COVID-19 (46,6%) fue atribuible a las personas menores de 60 años y fue mayor en los hombres. Las personas ≥ 60 años presentaron un mayor riesgo de progresión a estado crítico en comparación con las personas entre 35-60 años (hazard ratio 2,5; intervalo de confianza 95% 2,5-12,5) y menores de 35 años (9,1; intervalo de confianza 95% 4,0-20,6).
Conclusión
En Córdoba, la mortalidad prematura por COVID-19 estuvo sustancialmente representada por las personas menores de 60 años y fue mayor en el sexo masculino. Nuestros datos pueden ser representativos de poblaciones latinoamericanas con gran propagación de infecciones durante el primer año de la pandemia y aportan aspectos metodológicos novedosos para la estimación de parámetros que pueden ser útiles para medir la carga de COVID-19 en otros países de la región.

AB  - Highly mutable influenza is successfully countered based on individual susceptibility and similar precision-like medicine approach should be effective against SARS-COV-2. Among predictive markers to bring precision medicine to COVID-19, circulating ACE2 has potential features being upregulated in both severe COVID-19 and predisposing comorbidities. Spike SARS-CoVs were shown to induce ADAM17-mediated shedding of enzymatic active ACE2, thus accounting for its increased activity that has also been suggested to induce positive feedback loops leading to COVID-19-like manifestations. For this reason, pre-existing ACE2 activity and inhibition of ACE2/ADAM17 zinc-metalloproteases through zinc chelating agents have been proposed to predict COVID-19 outcome before infection and to protect from COVID-19, respectively. Since most diagnostic laboratories are not equipped for enzymatic activity determination, other potential predictive markers of disease progression exploitable by diagnostic laboratories were explored. Concentrations of circulating albumin, zinc, ACE2 protein and its activity were investigated in healthy, diabetic (COVID-19-susceptible) and SARS-CoV-2-negative COVID-19 individuals. ACE2 both protein levels and activity significantly increased in COVID-19 and diabetic patients. Abnormal high levels of ACE2 characterised a subgroup (16–19%) of diabetics, while COVID-19 patients were characterised by significantly higher zinc/albumin ratios, pointing to a relative increase of albumin-unbound zinc species, such as free zinc ones. Data on circulating ACE2 levels are in line with the hypothesis that they can drive susceptibility to COVID-19 and elevated zinc/albumin ratios support the therapeutic use of zinc chelating inhibitors of ACE2/ADAM17 zinc-metalloproteases in a targeted therapy for COVID-19.

AB  - Background
The impact of the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) wave on cancer patient management was measured within the nationwide network of the Unicancer comprehensive cancer centers in France.
Patients and methods
The number of patients diagnosed and treated within 17 of the 18 Unicancer centers was collected in 2020 and compared with that during the same periods between 2016 and 2019. Unicancer centers treat close to 20% of cancer patients in France yearly. The reduction in the number of patients attending the Unicancer centers was analyzed per regions and cancer types. The impact of delayed care on cancer-related deaths was calculated based on different hypotheses.
Results
A 6.8% decrease in patients managed within Unicancer in the first 7 months of 2020 versus 2019 was observed. This reduction reached 21% during April and May, and was not compensated in June and July, nor later until November 2020. This reduction was observed only for newly diagnosed patients, while the clinical activity for previously diagnosed patients increased by 4% similar to previous years. The reduction was more pronounced in women, in breast and prostate cancers, and for patients without metastasis. Using an estimated hazard ratio of 1.06 per month of delay in diagnosis and treatment of new patients, we calculated that the delays observed in the 5-month period from March to July 2020 may result in an excess mortality due to cancer of 1000-6000 patients in coming years.
Conclusions
In this study, the delays in cancer patient management were observed only for newly diagnosed patients, more frequently in women, for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and nonmetastatic cancers. These delays may result is an excess risk of cancer-related deaths in the coming years.

AB  - Background
Women with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) had worse outcomes than men prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although concomitant COVID-19 infection increases mortality risk in STEMI patients, no studies have evaluated sex differences in this context.
Methods
The North American COVID-19 STEMI registry is a prospective, multicenter registry of hospitalized STEMI patients with COVID-19 infection. We compared sex differences in clinical characteristics, presentation, management strategies, and in-hospital mortality.
Results
Among 585 patients with STEMI and COVID-19 infection, 154 (26.3%) were women. Compared to men, women were significantly older, had a higher prevalence of diabetes and stroke/transient ischemic attack, and were more likely to be on statins on presentation. Men more frequently presented with chest pain, whereas women presented with dyspnea. Women more often had STEMI without an identified culprit lesion than men (33% vs 18%, P < .001). The use of percutaneous coronary intervention was significantly higher in men, whereas medical therapy was higher in women. In-hospital mortality was 33% for women and 27% for men (P = .22).
Conclusions
In patients presenting with STEMI in the context of COVID-19, the in-hospital mortality rate was 30% and similar for men and women. Lack of an identifiable culprit lesion was common in the setting of COVID-19 for both sexes but more likely in women (1/3 of women vs 1/5 of men). Evaluation of specific underlying etiologies is underway to better define the full impact of COVID-19 on STEMI outcomes and better understand the observed sex differences.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 has quickly spread throughout the world, necessitating assessment of effective containment methods. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of government mandated school closures, stay at home orders and mask requirements
Methods
Cumulative incidence rates were calculated at 14-day intervals until the day of the first vaccine administration in the country. Rate ratios were calculated using negative binomial regression while investigating the effects of adjusting for several sociodemographic and medical factors
Results
Faster implementation of mask mandates was consistently shown to be protective. States with mask mandates made at three to six months had a 1.61 times higher rate than those who implemented within one month (adjusted rate ratio = 1.61, 95% confidence interval: 1.23-2.10, P = .001). States with mask mandates made after 6 months or with no mandate had a 2.16 times higher rate than those who implemented within 1 month (adjusted rate ratio = 2.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.64-2.88, P < .0001). In contrast, both stay at home orders and school closures had no significant influence on disease trajectory.
Discussion
The benefits of mask mandates are apparent, especially when mandates were issued within a month. The impact of school closing and stay at home orders were less clear.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that of the different physical distancing measures implemented by the government, mask mandates are the most important.

AB  - Will the COVID-19 pandemic interrupt the recent European urbanization trends – and if so – what is the magnitude of this sudden shock, and how deaths, births, and net migration contribute to this disruption? Until now, most discussions on the topic have circled either around the anecdotal evidence of city center decline, or contrarian speculations about residential inertia and the forthcoming business-as-usual. Bringing clarity to the uncertainty and confusion surrounding COVID-19, this paper seeks to detect overarching patterns in and the magnitude of its sudden shock to long-term urban trajectories, understood as a reversal of the pre-pandemic population development trend, across European cities in the early 2020s. It reveals that during the first year of COVID-19, population growth in European cities significantly slowed down to −0.3 % per annum, with 28 % of all European cities having experienced a U-turn from population growth to loss. Out-migration was the main driver of such rapid urban shrinkage, while excess mortality associated with COVID-19 has also contributed to population loss in several European city-regions; some, especially, smaller cities suffered from a significant drop in birth rates. Based on the factorial, hierarchical, and temporal dimensions of the COVID-19 crisis, the paper provides a plausible forecast about the future of Europe's post-coronavirus city.

AB  - Summary
Background
The inverse care law states that disadvantaged populations need more health care than advantaged populations but receive less. Gaps in COVID-19-related health care and infection control are not well understood. We aimed to examine inequalities in health in the care cascade from testing for SARS-CoV-2 to COVID-19-related hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death in Switzerland, a wealthy country strongly affected by the pandemic.
Methods
We analysed surveillance data reported to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health from March 1, 2020, to April 16, 2021, and 2018 population data. We geocoded residential addresses of notifications to identify the Swiss neighbourhood index of socioeconomic position (Swiss-SEP). The index describes 1·27 million small neighbourhoods of approximately 50 households each on the basis of rent per m2, education and occupation of household heads, and crowding. We used negative binomial regression models to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) of the association between ten groups of the Swiss-SEP index defined by deciles (1=lowest, 10=highest) and outcomes. Models were adjusted for sex, age, canton, and wave of the epidemic (before or after June 8, 2020). We used three different denominators: the general population, the number of tests, and the number of positive tests.
Findings
Analyses were based on 4 129 636 tests, 609 782 positive tests, 26 143 hospitalisations, 2432 ICU admissions, 9383 deaths, and 8 221 406 residents. Comparing the highest with the lowest Swiss-SEP group and using the general population as the denominator, more tests were done among people living in neighbourhoods of highest SEP compared with lowest SEP (adjusted IRR 1·18 [95% CrI 1·02–1·36]). Among tested people, test positivity was lower (0·75 [0·69–0·81]) in neighbourhoods of highest SEP than of lowest SEP. Among people testing positive, the adjusted IRR was 0·68 (0·62–0·74) for hospitalisation, was 0·54 (0·43–0·70) for ICU admission, and 0·86 (0·76–0·99) for death. The associations between neighbourhood SEP and outcomes were stronger in younger age groups and we found heterogeneity between areas.
Interpretation
The inverse care law and socioeconomic inequalities were evident in Switzerland during the COVID-19 epidemic. People living in neighbourhoods of low SEP were less likely to be tested but more likely to test positive, be admitted to hospital, or die, compared with those in areas of high SEP. It is essential to continue to monitor testing for SARS-CoV-2, access and uptake of COVID-19 vaccination and outcomes of COVID-19. Governments and health-care systems should address this pandemic of inequality by taking measures to reduce health inequalities in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

AB  - Summary
Background
To date, influenza epidemics have been considered suitable for use as a model for the COVID-19 epidemic, given that they are respiratory diseases with similar modes of transmission. However, data directly comparing the two diseases are scarce.
Methods
We did a nationwide retrospective cohort study using the French national administrative database (PMSI), which includes discharge summaries for all hospital admissions in France. All patients hospitalised for COVID-19 from March 1 to April 30, 2020, and all patients hospitalised for influenza between Dec 1, 2018, and Feb 28, 2019, were included. The diagnosis of COVID-19 (International Classification of Diseases [10th edition] codes U07.10, U07.11, U07.12, U07.14, or U07.15) or influenza (J09, J10, or J11) comprised primary, related, or associated diagnosis. Comparisons of risk factors, clinical characteristics, and outcomes between patients hospitalised for COVID-19 and influenza were done, with data also stratified by age group.
Findings
89 530 patients with COVID-19 and 45 819 patients with influenza were hospitalised in France during the respective study periods. The median age of patients was 68 years (IQR 52–82) for COVID-19 and 71 years (34–84) for influenza. Patients with COVID-19 were more frequently obese or overweight, and more frequently had diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia than patients with influenza, whereas those with influenza more frequently had heart failure, chronic respiratory disease, cirrhosis, and deficiency anaemia. Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 more frequently developed acute respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, septic shock, or haemorrhagic stroke than patients with influenza, but less frequently developed myocardial infarction or atrial fibrillation. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with influenza (15 104 [16·9%] of 89 530 vs 2640 [5·8%] of 45 819), with a relative risk of death of 2·9 (95% CI 2·8–3·0) and an age-standardised mortality ratio of 2·82. Of the patients hospitalised, the proportion of paediatric patients (<18 years) was smaller for COVID-19 than for influenza (1227 [1·4%] vs 8942 [19·5%]), but a larger proportion of patients younger than 5 years needed intensive care support for COVID-19 than for influenza (14 [2·3%] of 613 vs 65 [0·9%] of 6973). In adolescents (11–17 years), the in-hospital mortality was ten-times higher for COVID-19 than for influenza (five [1·1% of 458 vs one [0·1%] of 804), and patients with COVID-19 were more frequently obese or overweight.
Interpretation
The presentation of patients with COVID-19 and seasonal influenza requiring hospitalisation differs considerably. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is likely to have a higher potential for respiratory pathogenicity, leading to more respiratory complications and to higher mortality. In children, although the rate of hospitalisation for COVID-19 appears to be lower than for influenza, in-hospital mortality is higher; however, low patient numbers limit this finding. These findings highlight the importance of appropriate preventive measures for COVID-19, as well as the need for a specific vaccine and treatment.

AB  - A large proportion of Americans have at least one disability and yet people with disabilities face inequities in health and health care access. Factors associated with underlying disability and health, how they perceive and interact with the world, and where they live, or work may increase the risk people with disabilities face for illness or severe outcomes from seasonal influenza. Given the need to reduce the burden of respiratory illness on a healthcare system already overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic, maximizing seasonal influenza vaccination coverage is particularly important in 2020–2021. It is critical this season to ensure equitable access to influenza vaccination for people with disabilities. Providing influenza vaccination services in the unique places where people with disabilities are living, working, or receiving care during the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial, as well as communicating effectively to people with different types of disabilities.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 vaccine uptake by healthcare workers (HCWs) is critical to protect HCWs, the patients they care for, and the healthcare infrastructure. Our study aims to examine the actual COVID-19 vaccination rate among HCWs and identify risk factors associated with vaccine nonacceptance.
Study Design and Methods
A retrospective analysis of COVID-19 vaccinations for HCWs at a large multi-site US academic medical center from 12/18/2020 through 05/04/2021. Comparisons between groups were performed using unpaired student t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. A logistic regression analysis was used to assess the associations between vaccine uptake and risk factor(s).
Results
Of the 65,270 HCWs included in our analysis, the overall vaccination rate was 78.6%. Male gender, older age, White and Asian race, and direct patient care were associated with higher vaccination rates (P <.0001). Significant differences were observed between different job categories. Physicians and advanced practice staff, and healthcare professionals were more likely to be vaccinated than nurses and support staff.
Conclusions
Our data demonstrated higher initial vaccination rates among HCWs than the general population national average during the study period. We observed significant disparities among different high-risk HCWs groups, especially among different job categories, black HCWs and younger HCWs despite their high risk of contracting the infection. Interventions to address lower vaccination rate and vaccine hesitancy should be built with these disparities and differences in mind to create more targeted interventions.

AB  - This study examines the association between COVID-19 mortality rates and internal conflict and investigates the possible moderating role of government economic support during the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021. Our main hypothesis suggests that countries with lower levels of government economic support are more likely to experience a positive correlation between higher COVID-19 mortality rates and the emergence of internal conflict. Using cross-country data from over 100 countries and controlling for various factors that may influence internal conflict, our analysis provides some support for this hypothesis. The results suggest a possible moderating role for government economic support, with the evidence indicating a weakening or elimination of the association between COVID-19 mortality rates and internal conflict when government economic support is adequate. However, the moderating effect of government economic support is not always significant, and caution is needed when interpreting the results. Our analysis also highlights the potential risks associated with low levels of government economic support during the pandemic. Specifically, we find that in countries where the government's macro-financial package in response to the pandemic is less than approximately 25% of GDP, there is a possible risk of growth in civil disorder resulting from increased COVID-19 deaths per million.

AB  - Different modeling approaches can be used to calculate excess deaths for the COVID-19 pandemic period. We compared 6 calculations of excess deaths (4 previously published [3 without age-adjustment] and two new ones that we performed with and without age-adjustment) for 2020–2021. With each approach, we calculated excess deaths metrics and the ratio R of excess deaths over recorded COVID-19 deaths. The main analysis focused on 33 high-income countries with weekly deaths in the Human Mortality Database (HMD at mortality.org) and reliable death registration. Secondary analyses compared calculations for other countries, whenever available. Across the 33 high-income countries, excess deaths were 2.0–2.8 million without age-adjustment, and 1.6–2.1 million with age-adjustment with large differences across countries. In our analyses after age-adjustment, 8 of 33 countries had no overall excess deaths; there was a death deficit in children; and 0.478 million (29.7%) of the excess deaths were in people <65 years old. In countries like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain excess death estimates differed 2 to 4-fold between highest and lowest figures. The R values’ range exceeded 0.3 in all 33 countries. In 16 of 33 countries, the range of R exceeded 1. In 25 of 33 countries some calculations suggest R > 1 (excess deaths exceeding COVID-19 deaths) while others suggest R < 1 (excess deaths smaller than COVID-19 deaths). Inferred data from 4 evaluations for 42 countries and from 3 evaluations for another 98 countries are very tenuous. Estimates of excess deaths are analysis-dependent and age-adjustment is important to consider. Excess deaths may be lower than previously calculated.

AB  - Objective
There is evidence of a bidirectional association between COVID-19 disease and psychiatric disorders. We aimed to assess whether exposure to psychotropic medications prior to hospitalization was associated with mortality or discharge within 30 days after hospital admission.
Methods
In this prospective study, we included all individuals with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who were admitted to the Bologna University Hospital between 1st March 2020 and 31st January 2021. We collected data about pre-existing psychiatric disorders and the use of psychotropic medications at the admission. As univariate analyses, we estimated cumulative incidence functions for 30-day mortality and discharge stratifying by exposure to each of the psychotropic medication classes. Finally, we fitted Cox regression models to estimate cause-specific Hazard Ratios (HR) of 30-day mortality and discharge. Results were adjusted for sociodemographic (age, sex), clinically relevant variables (comorbidity, c-reactive protein levels, severity of disease at presentation, history of smoking, study period), and psychiatric variables (psychiatric disorder diagnosis, number of psychotropic medications).
Results
Out of a total of 1238 hospitalized patients, 316 were prescribed psychotropic medications at the time of admission. Among these, 45 (3.6%) were taking a first-generation antipsychotics (FGA) and 66 (5.3%) a second generation antipsychotic (SGA). Exposure to SGA was associated with increased rates of 30-day mortality (HR = 2.01, 95%CI = 1.02–3.97) and exposure to FGA was associated with decreased rates of 30-day discharge (HR = 0.55, 95%CI = 0.33–0.90).
Conclusion
Patients with COVID-19 infection exposed to FGA and SGA may have worse COVID-19 infection outcomes.

AB  - Importance
The actual risk of thrombotic events after Covid-19 vaccination is unknown.
Objective
To evaluate the risk of thrombotic events after Covid-19 vaccination.
Design
Retrospective cohort study which included consecutive adult patients vaccinated with the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine between January 1 and May 30, 2021, and a historic control group, defined as consecutive patients vaccinated with influenza vaccine between March 1 and July 30, 2019.
Setting
Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, a tertiary hospital in Argentina.
Participants
Non-Hospitalized Adults vaccinated with the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.
Exposure
Vaccination with Covid-19 vaccines available during the study period: Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca/Oxford or Covishield), BBIBP-CorV (Beijing Institute of Biological Products) (Sinopharm). Active comparator group exposure was Influenza vaccine.
Main outcome
Primary endpoint was cumulative incidence of any symptomatic thrombotic event at 30 days, defined as the occurrence of at least one of the following: symptomatic acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT); symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE); acute ischemic stroke (AIS); acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or arterial thrombosis.
Results
From a total of 29,985 adult patients who received at least a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine during study period and 24,777 who received Influenza vaccine in 2019, we excluded those who were vaccinated during hospitalization. We finally included 29,918 and 24,753 patients respectively. Median age was 73 years old (IQR 75–81) and 67% were females in both groups. Thirty six subjects in the Covid-19 vaccination group (36/29,918) and 15 patients in the Influenza vaccination group (15/24,753) presented at least one thrombotic event. The cumulative incidence of any thrombotic event at 30 days was 12 per 10,000 (95%CI 9–17) for Covid-19 group and 6 per 10,000 (95%CI 4–10) for Influenza group (p-value=0.022).
Conclusions and relevance
This study shows a significant increase in thrombotic events in subjects vaccinated with Covid-19 vaccines in comparison to a control group. The clinical implication of these findings should be interpreted with caution, in light of the high effectiveness of vaccination and the inherent risk of thrombosis from Covid-19 infection itself.

AB  - The global SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic presents a pressing health challenge for all countries, including Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ). As of early 2022, NZ public health measures have reduced impacts of the pandemic, but ongoing efforts to limit illness and fatalities will be significantly aided by widescale uptake of available vaccines including COVID-19 booster doses. Decades of research have established a broad range of demographic, social, cognitive, and behavioural factors which influence peoples’ uptake of vaccinations, including a large amount of research in the last two years focused on COVID-19 vaccination in particular. In this study, we surveyed people in New Zealand (N = 660) in May and June of 2021, at which point the vaccine had been made available to high-risk groups. We explored individual versus collective motivations, finding that people who were hesitant about COVID-19 vaccination scored lower on independent self-construals (how people define themselves) but higher on community identity, weaker but still positive perceived social norms, lower general risk of COVID-19 to New Zealanders and higher vaccine risk for both themselves and others, and lower response-efficacy both for personal and collective benefits. Overall, the findings suggest some benefit of collective over individual appeals, but that generally messaging to encourage vaccination should focus on conveying social norms, risk from COVID-19 broadly, and vaccine safety and efficacy.

AB  - Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global emergency able to overwhelm the healthcare capacities worldwide and to affect the older generation especially. When addressing the pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, it becomes evident that the disease targets pathways and domains affected by the main aging- and frailty-related pathophysiological changes. A closer analysis of the existing data supports a possible role of biological age rather than chronological age in the prognosis of COVID-19. There is a need for systematic, consequent action of identifying frail (not only older, not only multimorbid, not only symptomatic) persons at risk of poor outcomes.

Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with severe mental illness (SMI) have worse outcomes than counterparts without SMI. Barriers in access to acute care medical procedures among SMI patients may partially explain this phenomenon. Here, we examined differences in critical care admission and in-hospital mortality between hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without SMI.
Methods
This population-based study used Spain's nationwide electronic health records. Based on International Classification Diseases, Tenth Revision, ICD-10-CM codes, we identified all patients aged ≥15 years hospitalized due to COVID-19 between July 1st-December 31st, 2020, and compared patients with and without SMI in terms of (i) critical care admission and (ii) in-hospital mortality – overall and stratified by age. We used logistic regression models including sex, age, and comorbidity burden as measured by Charlson Comorbidity Index Score as covariates.
Results
Of 118,691 hospital admissions due to COVID-19 of people aged ≥15 years, 1512 (1.3%) included a diagnosis of SMI. Compared to non-SMI patients, SMI patients had higher in-hospital mortality (OR,95%CI: 1.63,1.42–1.88) and were less frequently admitted to critical care (OR,95%CI: 0.70,0.58–0.85). Admission to critical care in SMI patients was lower than for non-SMI counterparts only among individuals aged ≥60 years. The magnitude of the difference in in-hospital mortality between SMI and non-SMI patients decreased as age increased.
Conclusions
Individuals with SMI had reduced critical care admission and increased in-hospital mortality compared non-SMI counterparts, suggesting that differences in delivery of acute care medical procedures may partially explain higher risk of negative outcomes among COVID-19 patients with SMI.

KW  - Immunocompromised
AB  - Objectives
After the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the severe COVID-19 burden falls upon immunocompromised patients who cannot mount an endogenous immune response after both vaccination and/or natural infection. They also experience persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection with high viral loads often unsuccessfully managed by the standard antiviral monotherapy regimen initially validated for treatment of COVID-19 immunocompetent patients, only. The off-label prescription of such monotherapy regimens in immunocompromised patients is likely to drive the emergence of treatment-related immune escape, relapses, excess morbidity, and mortality from both COVID-19 and delayed treatment of the underlying disorders. A possible treatment approach to mitigate such consequence is based on combined antiviral therapies.
Methods
We searched PubMed for case reports, case series and clinical trials reporting the usage of combined antiviral therapies for COVID-19.
Results
In this narrative review, we show that combinations of either small molecule antivirals or small molecule antiviral plus passive immunotherapies are safe and effective in small cohorts reported so far.
Conclusion
Considering the progressive loss of efficacy of all authorized anti-spike monoclonal antibodies, promising regimen options are reserved to combinations of small molecule antivirals and COVID-19 convalescent plasma from vaccinated donors.

AB  - Antiphospholipid syndrome and the coagulopathy of COVID-19 share many pathophysiologic features, including endotheliopathy, hypercoagulability, and activation of platelets, complement pathways, and neutrophil extracellular traps, all acting in concert via a model of immunothrombosis. Antiphospholipid antibody production in COVID-19 is common, with 50% of COVID-19 patients being positive for lupus anticoagulant in some studies, and with non-Sapporo criteria antiphospholipid antibodies being prevalent as well. The biological significance of antiphospholipid antibodies in COVID-19 is uncertain, as such antibodies are usually transient, and studies examining clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with and without antiphospholipid antibodies have yielded conflicting results. In this review, we explore the biology of antiphospholipid antibodies in COVID-19 and other infections and discuss mechanisms of thrombogenesis in antiphospholipid syndrome and parallels with COVID-19 coagulopathy. In addition, we review the existing literature on safety of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and antiphospholipid syndrome.

AB  - Background
Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are at high risk of thrombotic complications and organ failure, and often exhibit severe inflammation, which may contribute to hypercoagulability.
Objectives
To determine whether patients hospitalized for COVID-19 experience differing frequencies of thrombotic and organ failure complications and derive variable benefits from therapeutic-dose heparin dependent on the extent of systemic inflammation and whether observed benefit from therapeutic-dose anticoagulation varies depending on the degree of systemic inflammation.
Methods
We analyzed data from 1346 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 enrolled in the ATTACC and ACTIV-4a platforms who were randomized to therapeutic-dose heparin or usual care for whom levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were reported at baseline.
Results
Increased CRP was associated with worse patient outcomes, including a >98% posterior probability of increased organ support requirement, hospital length of stay, risk of 28-day mortality, and incidence of major thrombotic events or death (patients with CRP 40-100 mg/L or ≥100 mg/L compared to patients with CRP <40 mg/L). Patients with CRP 40 to 100 mg/L experienced the greatest degree of benefit from treatment with therapeutic doses of unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin compared with usual-care prophylactic doses. This was most significant for an increase in organ support-free days (odds ratio: 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.40; 97.9% posterior probability of beneficial effect), with trends toward benefit for other evaluated outcomes.
Conclusion
Moderately ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with CRP between 40 mg/L and 100 mg/L derived the greatest benefit from treatment with therapeutic-dose heparin.

AB  - The objective of this systematic review is to give a comprehensive interpretation of menstrual cycle changes after the COVID-19 vaccination. Additionally, it is imperative to assess reports of menstrual changes following vaccination to dispel concerns that COVID-19 vaccines hinder the likelihood of pregnancy in the long run. A literature review was conducted using digital databases to systematically identify the studies reporting any menstrual abnormalities after the COVID-19 vaccine. Detailed patient-level study characteristics including the type of study, sample size, administered vaccines, and menstrual abnormalities were abstracted. A total of 78 138 vaccinated females were included in this review from 14 studies. Of these, 39 759 (52.05%) had some form of a menstrual problem after vaccination. Due to the lack of published research articles, preprints were also included in this review. Menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and polymenorrhea were the most commonly observed problems and the overall study-level rate of menstrual abnormality ranged from 0.83% to 90.9%. Age, history of pregnancy, systemic side-effects of COVID-19, smoking, and second dose of COVID-19 vaccine were predictors of menstrual problems after vaccination.
Resumen
Alteraciones menstruales tras la vacunación contra la COVID-19: revisión sistemática Resumen El objetivo de esta revisión sistemática es aportar una interpretación amplia sobre los cambios de los ciclos menstruales tras la vacunación contra la COVID-19. Además, es imperativo evaluar los informes sobre los cambios menstruales tras la vacunación, para disipar preocupaciones en cuanto a que las vacunas contra la COVID-19 dificultan la probabilidad de embarazo a largo plazo. Se realizó una revisión de la literatura utilizando bases de datos digitales para identificar sistemáticamente los estudios que reportan cualquier alteración menstrual tras la vacuna contra la COVID-19. Se resumieron las características detalladas del estudio al nivel del paciente, incluyendo tipo de estudio, tamaño de la muestra, vacunas administradas, y alteraciones menstruales. Se incluyó en la revisión a un total de 78 138 mujeres vacunadas, procedentes de 14 estudios. De ellas, 39 759 (52,05%) tuvieron algún tipo de problema menstrual tras la vacunación. Debido a la falta de artículos de investigación publicados, también se incluyeron preimpresos en esta revisión. Menorragia, metrorragia, y polimenorrea fueron los problemas más comúnmente observados, oscilando la tasa global de alteraciones menstruales a nivel de estudios entre el 0,83 y el 90,9%. La edad, los antecedentes de embarazos, los efectos secundarios sistémicos de la COVID-19, el tabaquismo y la segunda dosis de la vacuna contra la COVID-19 fueron factores predictivos de problemas menstruales tras la vacunación.

AB  - This paper presents a political economy analysis of global inequities in access to COVID-19 vaccines, treatments, and diagnostic tests. We adapt a conceptual model used for analysing the political economy of global extraction and health to examine the politico-economic factors affecting access to COVID-19 health products and technologies in four interconnected layers: the social, political, and historical context; politics, institutions, and policies; pathways to ill-health; and health consequences. Our analysis finds that battles over access to COVID-19 products occur in a profoundly unequal playing field, and that efforts to improve access that do not shift the fundamental power imbalances are bound to fail. Inequitable access has both direct effects on health (preventable illness and death) and indirect effects through exacerbation of poverty and inequality. We highlight how the case of COVID-19 products reflects broader patterns of structural violence, in which the political economy is structured to improve and lengthen the lives of those in the Global North while neglecting and shortening the lives of those in the Global South. We conclude that achieving equitable access to pandemic response products requires shifting longstanding power imbalances and the institutions and processes that entrench and enable them.

AB  - Introduction
During the first and second epidemic waves in Spain, the SARS-CoV-2 case-fatality rates (CFRs) showed significant differences between Autonomous Communities (ACs). Comparing CFRs in the third and fifth epidemic waves can provide information on the impact of the different vaccination coverages in the ACs.
Objective
To evaluate the impact of vaccination on COVID-19 CFRs in the third and fifth epidemic waves in Spain, according to sex, age, and AC.
Methods
This work is an observational, descriptive study which uses data on COVID-19 infections, deaths, and vaccinees published by the Spanish Ministry of Health and the regional Health Departments of the ACs. The third epidemic wave was defined as the period from 26th December 2020 to 19th April 2021, and the fifth wave, from 19th July to 19th September 2021. The CFRs (deaths per 1000 infected [‰]) were calculated according to sex, age group, and AC. The standardized case-fatality ratio (SCFR) was adjusted for age and sex for each wave. We estimated the correlation between CFRs and their change between the two epidemic waves with the vaccination coverages reached at the beginning of the fifth wave.
Results
The CFR in the fifth wave (5.7‰) was lower than in the third wave (16.5‰). In addition, the CFR in both waves was significantly higher in men than in women, and in older people than in younger ones. A decrease in the CFR between both waves was only observed in those older than 49. A strong direct and positive correlation (R2a=0.8399) was found between vaccination coverage by age group and decrease in CFR between both epidemic waves. Significant differences were seen between ACs in the two waves, as regards both CFRs and SCFRs. When comparing ACs, a direct correlation was observed between vaccination coverage and CFRs in the fifth wave, and also – although weak – between vaccination coverage and decrease in CFR between both waves.
Conclusion
The CFR significantly decreased in Spain between the third and the fifth epidemic waves in population aged 50 or older, probably due to the high vaccination coverage in that age group. Differences were observed between CFRs and SCFRs between ACs that are not explained by the differences in vaccination coverage, suggesting the need for further research and evaluation.
Resumen
Introducción
Durante la primera y segunda oleadas epidémicas en España, las tasas de letalidad (TL) por SARS-CoV-2 mostraron diferencias significativas entre comunidades autónomas (CC. AA.). La comparación de las TL en la tercera y quinta oleadas epidémicas puede aportar información sobre el impacto de las diferentes coberturas vacunales en las CC. AA.
Objetivo
Evaluar el impacto de la vacunación sobre las TL de COVID-19 en la tercera y quinta onda epidémica en España, según sexo, edad y CC. AA.
Métodos
Este trabajo es un estudio observacional, descriptivo, que utiliza los datos de infectados, fallecidos y vacunados por COVID-19 publicados por el Ministerio de Sanidad y las Consejerías de Sanidad de las CC. AA. La tercera onda epidémica se definió como el periodo comprendido entre el 26 de diciembre de 2020 y el 19 de abril de 2021, y la quinta onda, entre el 19 de julio y el 19 de septiembre de 2021. Las TL (muertes por cada 1.000 infectados [‰]) se calcularon en función del sexo, el grupo de edad y la CC. AA. La razón estandarizada de letalidad (REL) se ajustó por edad y sexo para cada oleada. Se estimó la correlación entre las TL y su cambio entre las 2 oleadas epidémicas con las coberturas de vacunación alcanzadas al inicio de la quinta oleada.
Resultados
La TL en la quinta onda (5,7‰) fue inferior a la de la tercera onda (16,5‰). Además, la TL en ambas oleadas fue significativamente mayor en varones que en mujeres, y en personas mayores que en jóvenes. Solo se observó una disminución de la TL entre ambas oleadas en los mayores de 49 años. Se encontró una fuerte correlación directa y positiva (R2a=0,8399) entre la cobertura de vacunación por grupo de edad y la disminución de la TL entre ambas oleadas epidémicas. Se observaron diferencias significativas entre las CC. AA. en las 2 oleadas, tanto en lo que respecta a las TL como a las REL. Al comparar las CC. AA., se observó una correlación directa entre la cobertura de vacunación y las TL en la quinta onda, y también – aunque débil – entre la cobertura de vacunación y la disminución de las TL entre ambas ondas.
Conclusiones
La TL disminuyó significativamente en España entre la tercera y la quinta ondas epidémicas en la población de 50 o más años, probablemente debido a las altas coberturas vacunales en ese grupo de edad. Se observaron diferencias entre las TL y las REL entre CC. AA. que no se explican por las diferencias en las coberturas vacunales, lo que sugiere la necesidad de nuevas investigaciones y evaluaciones.

AB  - Objectives: In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore, the vast majority of infected persons were migrant workers living in dormitories who had few medical comorbidities. In 2021, with the Delta and Omicron waves, this shifted to the more vulnerable, elderly population within the local community. We examined evolving trends among the hospitalised cases of COVID-19. Methods: All patients with polymerase chain reaction-positive SARS-CoV-2 admitted from February 2020 to October 2021 were included and subsequently stratified by their year of admission (2020 or 2021). We compared the baseline clinical characteristics, clinical course, and outcomes. Results: A majority of cases were seen in 2020 (n = 1359), compared with 2021 (n = 422), due to the large outbreaks in migrant worker dormitories. Nevertheless, the greater proportion of locally transmitted cases outside of dormitories in 2021 (78.7% vs 12.3%) meant a significantly older population with more medical comorbidities had COVID-19. This led to an observably higher proportion of patients with severe disease presenting with raised inflammatory markers, need for therapeutics, supplemental oxygenation, and higher mortality. Conclusion: Changing demographics and the characteristics of the exposed populations are associated with distinct differences in clinical presentation and outcomes. Older age remained consistently associated with adverse outcomes.

AB  - Background
To date, it is not fully understood to what extent COVID-19 has burdened society in Japan. This study aimed to estimate the total disease burden due to COVID-19 in Japan during 2020–2021.
Methods
We stratify disease burden estimates by age group and present it as absolute Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) lost and QALYs lost per 100,000 persons. The total estimated value of QALYs lost consists of (1) QALYs lost brought by deaths due to COVID-19, (2) QALYs lost brought by inpatient cases, (3) QALYs lost brought by outpatient cases, and (4) QALYs lost brought by long-COVID.
Results
The total QALYs lost due to COVID-19 was estimated as 286,782 for two years, 114.0 QALYs per 100,000 population per year. 71.3% of them were explained by the burden derived from deaths. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the burden of outpatient cases was the most sensitive factor.
Conclusions
The large part of disease burden due to COVID-19 in Japan from the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2021 was derived from Wave 3, 4, and 5 and the proportion of QALYs lost due to morbidity in the total burden increased gradually. The estimated disease burden was smaller than that in other high-income countries. It will be our future challenge to take other indirect factors into consideration.

AB  - Background
The risks of severe outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) are elevated in unvaccinated individuals. It remains crucial to understand patterns of COVID-19 vaccination, particularly in younger and remote populations where coverage often lags. This study examined disparities in COVID-19 vaccine coverage in farm children and adolescents.
Methods
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted in patients of the Marshfield Clinic Health System (MCHS) in Wisconsin. The sample included children/adolescents age 5–17 years who were eligible for COVID-19 vaccine initiation for ≥ 90 days (as of September 30, 2022), stratified by those who lived vs did not live on a farm. Outcomes included COVID-19 vaccine initiation, series completion, and booster receipt. Multivariable regression was used to examine associations between COVID-19 vaccination and farm, as well as rural and non-rural, residence.
Results
There were 47,104 individuals (5% farm residents) in the sample. Overall, 33% of participants initiated and 31% completed the COVID-19 vaccine series. After adjustment, farm residence was associated with significantly lower odds of COVID-19 vaccine initiation (aOR [95% CI] = 0.68 [0.61, 0.75], p < 0.001), series completion (aOR = 0.67 [0.60, 0.75], p < 0.001), and booster receipt (aOR = 0.73 [0.61, 0.88], p = 0.001). Secondary analyses found COVID-19 vaccine coverage was lowest in young children who lived on dairy farms.
Conclusions
COVID-19 vaccine coverage is low in north-central Wisconsin children and adolescents. Those who live on farms have significantly lower likelihood of COVID-19 vaccine initiation, series completion, and booster receipt compared to non-farm counterparts. Farm families are an underserved group and require more effective public health interventions designed to prevent COVID-19.

AB  - Background
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) (pulmonary embolism [PE] or deep venous thrombosis [DVT]) is common during acute COVID-19. Long-term excess risk has not yet been established.
Objectives
To study long-term VTE risk after COVID-19.
Methods
Swedish citizens aged 18 to 84 years hospitalized and/or testing positive for COVID-19 between January 1, 2020, and September 11, 2021 (exposed), stratified by initial hospitalization, were compared to matched (1:5), nonexposed, population-derived subjects without COVID-19. Outcomes were incident VTE, PE, or DVT recorded within 60, 60 to <180, and ≥180 days. Cox regression was used for evaluation, and a model adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and socioeconomic markers was developed to control for confounders.
Results
Among exposed patients, 48,861 were hospitalized for COVID-19 (mean age, 60.6 years) and 894,121 were without hospitalization (mean age, 41.4 years). Among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, fully adjusted hazard ratios during 60 to <180 days were 6.05 (95% CI, 4.80-7.62) for PE and 3.97 (CI, 2.96-5.33) for DVT compared with that for nonexposed patients with corresponding estimates among those with COVID-19 without hospitalization 1.17 (CI, 1.01-1.35) and 0.99 (CI, 0.86-1.15), based on 475 and 2311 VTE events, respectively. Long-term (≥180 days) hazard ratios in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were 2.01 (CI, 1.51-2.68) for PE and 1.46 (CI, 1.05-2.01) for DVT, while nonhospitalized patients had similar risk as nonexposed patients, based on 467 and 2030 VTE events, respectively.
Conclusion
Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 retained an elevated excess risk of VTE, mainly PE, after 180 days, while long-term risk of VTE in individuals with COVID-19 without hospitalization was similar to that in the nonexposed patients.

AB  - Healthcare personnel (HCP) are at occupational risk for acquisition of several vaccine-preventable diseases and transmission to patients. Vaccinations of HCP are justified to confer them immunity but also to protect susceptible patients and healthcare services from outbreaks, HCP absenteeism and presenteeism. Mandatory vaccination policies for HCP are increasingly adopted and achieve high and sustainable vaccination rates in short term. In this article we review the scientific evidence for HCP vaccination. We also address issues pertaining to vaccination policies for HCP and present the challenges of implementation of mandatory versus voluntary vaccination policies. Finally, we discuss the issue of mandatory vaccination of HCP against COVID-19.

AB  - Vaccination is a critical preventive measure to reduce COVID-19 health risks. We utilize full information maximum likelihood (FIML) logistic regression to analyze COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a national sample of United States (US) adults (N = 2,022). Online survey data was collected between September 7th and October 3rd, 2021. Before weighting, the racial composition of the sample was as follows: Asian American (15.0 %), Black/African American (20.0 %), Hispanic/Latino (20.0 %), American Indian or Alaska Native (12.6 %), Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (12.5 %), and White (20.0 %). Informed by the Increasing Vaccination Model (IVM), we assessed the relationship between COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and experiences of racial discrimination (Krieger’s 9-item measure). Odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were greater for most younger age groups, women (OR = 1.96; 95 % CI[1.54, 2.49]), Black/African American respondents (OR = 1.68; 95 % CI[1.18, 2.39]), those with a high school education or less (OR = 1.46; 95 % CI[1.08, 1.98]), Independent (OR = 1.77; 95 % CI[1.34, 2.35]) or Republican political affiliation (OR = 2.69; 95 % CI[1.92, 3.79]), and prior COVID-19 infection (OR = 1.78; 95 % CI[1.29, 2.45]). Odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were 1.04 greater for every-one unit increase in lifetime experiences of racial discrimination (95 % CI[1.02, 1.05]). Odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were lower for Asian American respondents (OR = 0.682; 95 % CI[0.480, 0.969]), and those who had a primary care doctor had reduced odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (OR = 0.735; 95 % CI[0.542, 0.998). Our primary finding provides support for a link between experiences of racial discrimination and hesitancy towards a COVID-19 vaccine among US adults. We discuss implications for public health officials and future research.

AB  - Worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare services, including cervical cancer management, and an increased burden for this condition is expected. This systematic review synthetizes the available evidence on the impact of the pandemic on prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer. Searches were performed on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus for relevant studies on these topics with the purpose of comparing service access and care delivery before and during COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the methodological heterogeneity among the studies, findings were narratively discussed. Of the 715 screened titles and abstracts, 33 articles were included, corresponding to 42 reports that covered the outcomes of interest: vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) (6 reports), cancer screening (19), diagnosis (8), and treatment (8). Seven studies observed reductions in HPV vaccination uptake and coverage during COVID-19. Reports on cervical screening and cancer diagnosis activities showed a substantial impact of the pandemic on access to screening services and diagnostic procedures. All but one study that investigated cervical cancer treatment reported changes in the number of women with cervical lesions who received treatments, as well as treatment delay and interruption. With a major impact during the first wave in 2020, COVID-19 and restriction measures resulted in a substantial disruption in cervical cancer prevention and management, with declines in screening and delays in treatment. Taken together, findings from this systematic review calls for urgent policy interventions for recovering cervical cancer prevention and care.

AB  - In this paper we derive a theoretical model of the spread of a viral infection which we use as basis for an estimation strategy to test four interrelated hypotheses on the relationship between country-level COVID-19 mortality rates and the extent of urban development. Using data covering 81 countries we find evidence that countries with a higher population density, a higher share of the urban population living in the largest city, and countries with a higher urbanization rate had on average the same or fewer COVID-19 fatalities compared to less urbanized countries in 2020. Even though COVID-19 spreads faster in cities, fatalities may be lower, conditional on economic development, trust in government, and a well-functioning health care system. Generally, urbanization and city development are associated with economic development: with the resources urbanized countries have, it is easier for them to manage and maintain stricter lockdowns, and to roll out effective pharmaceutical interventions.

AB  - COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that has infected over 136 million people worldwide with over 2.9 million deaths as of 11 April 2021. In March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic and countries began to implement measures to control the spread of the virus. The spread and the death rates of the virus displayed dramatic differences among countries globally, showing that there are several factors affecting its spread and mortality. By utilizing the cumulative number of cases from John Hopkins University, the recovery rate, death rate, and the number of active, recovered, and death cases were simulated to analyse the trends and patterns within the chosen countries. 10 countries from 3 different case severity categories (high cases, medium cases, and low cases) and 5 continents (Asia, North America, South America, Europe, and Oceania) were studied. A generalized SEIR model which considers control measures such as isolation, and preventive measures such as vaccination is applied in this study. This model is able to capture not only the dynamics between the states, but also the time evolution of the states by using the fourth-order-Runge–Kutta process. This study found no significant patterns in the countries under the same case severity category, suggesting that there are other factors contributing to the pattern in these countries. One of the factors influencing the pattern in each country is the population’s age. COVID-19 related deaths were found to be notably higher among older people, indicating that countries comprising of a larger proportion of older age groups have an increased risk of experiencing higher death rates. Tighter governmental control measures led to fewer infections and eventually reduced the number of death cases, while increasing the recovery rate, and early implementations were found to be far more effective in controlling the spread of the virus and produced better outcomes.

AB  - Discussions about potential long-term health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on immigrant health and the healthy immigrant effect (HIE) remain unaddressed. Drawing on Canada as a case study, we summarize the primary and secondary impacts of COVID-19 on immigrants. We find that recent and female immigrants as well refugees have fared far worse than either their more established and male counterparts or the Canadian-born population. We then discuss how COVID-19 might influence (or weaken) immigrants' previously documented health advantage. We highlight two structural conditions induced by the pandemic that may alter the health profile of immigrants; namely, immigration policy and delayed medical treatments. Reflections on the requisite data for monitoring and tracking the overall impact of COVID-19 on immigrants' health are included. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the Canadian patterns and its potential relevance to immigrants and the HIE in the United States.

AB  - Objectives
The aim of this study was to assess the direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults with epilepsy in Glasgow.
Methods
We used routinely collected data for a previously identified cohort of patients with epilepsy to evaluate access to scheduled and unscheduled care with quarterly rates of inpatient admissions, outpatient attendance and accident & emergency attendance calculated. Anti-seizure medication prescribing and persistence, incidence of anxiety and depression and deaths for a cohort of patients with epilepsy was evaluated prior to the pandemic in comparison to during the pandemic, from 2015 to 2021.
Results
All-cause mortality and epilepsy related mortality showed a statistically significant reduction during the pandemic. Although overall rates of out-patient hospital attendance dropped during the early stages of the pandemic (and had not returned to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021) epilepsy-related services saw maintenance of patient contact as a result of a rapid adoption of telephone clinics. A significant decrease in overall mortality was observed in PWE during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. COVID-19 was the single commonest cause of death in PWE during the pandemic (61/453) and 160 patients (3.7%) had at least 1 admission to hospital for COVID-19. Anti-seizure medication (ASM) prescribing remained rates remained stable during the pandemic. During the pandemic an average of 38.8% of cohort patients were treated for depression and 16.3% for anxiety per quarter, 8.2% and 12.4% of whom had not been previously treated for these conditions respectively.
Conclusion
We have shown that during a national lockdown, in the context of a pandemic, mortality in patients with epilepsy has reduced, while out-patient services were delivered remotely, primarily via the telephone. The reasons for this remain unclear but suggest that some of the excess mortality in people with epilepsy may be potentially avoidable by changes in lifestyle.

AB  - Most studies have explored the Covid-19 outbreak by mainly focusing on restrictive public policies, human health, and behaviors at the macro level. However, the impacts of built and socio-economic environments, accounting for spatial effects on the spread at the local levels, have not been thoroughly studied. In this study, the relationships between the spatial spread of the virus and various indicators of the built and socio-economic environments are investigated, using Florida ZIP-code data on accumulated cases before large-scale vaccination campaigns began in 2021. Spatial regression models are used to account for the spatial dependencies and interactions that are core factors in Covid-19 spread. This study reveals both the spillover dynamics of the coronavirus spread at the ZIP code level and the existence of spatial dependencies among the unobserved variables represented by the error term. In addition, the findings show a positive association between the expected number of Covid-19 cases and specific land uses, such as education facilities and retail densities. Finally, the study highlights critical socio-economic characteristics causing a substantial increase in Covid-19 spread. Such results could help policymakers, public health experts, and urban planners design strategies to mitigate the spread of future Covid-19-like diseases.

AB  - Background
Migrant populations in high-income countries have faced myriad health and social inequities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Migrants often work in frontline essential services that expose them to COVID-19. Migrant workers in meat processing plants have endured large COVID-19 outbreaks across multiple countries.
Objectives
We examine current scientific evidence around COVID-19 transmission, outcomes, and prevention for migrant workers and highlight meat processing plants as an example.
Sources
We performed a series of PubMed searches between January 1, 2020 and January 12, 2022.
Content
Migrant workers in high-income countries often work in occupations at high risk for COVID-19 transmission, contract COVID-19 at higher rates, and experience worse outcomes than native-born counterparts. For example, meat processing plants represent almost ideal environments for rapid and large-scale SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission; often, large migrant workforces confined to small workspaces perform physically demanding work in noisy environments that require shouting to communicate, increasing workers' respiratory rates and the quantity of aerosolized droplets expelled and thus increasing viral transmission risk. Although enhanced vaccination outreach programs remain an important equity approach for migrant worker safety, they alone are insufficient. The emergence and rapid spread of multiple increasingly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with variable vaccine escape properties, including Omicron in November 2021, highlight the importance of improved infection prevention and control strategies to protect migrant workers. Across countries, strategies such as improving ventilation and mask quality in many high-risk occupational settings are already required by employment law. Universal mandatory vaccination program should also be considered.
Implications
COVID-19 transmission prevention for migrant workers requires an aggressive multicomponent plan that includes (a) improved on-site ventilation and infection prevention and control strategies; (b) improved social supports such as paid sick leave; (c) mobile vaccination clinics and community engagement to overcome vaccine hesitancy and barriers; and (d) consideration of universal mandatory vaccination programs.

AB  - Objectives
The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented health crisis resulting in over 6 million deaths worldwide, a figure, which continues to grow. In addition to the excess mortality, there are individuals who recovered from the acute stages, but suffered long-term changes in their health post COVID-19, commonly referred to as long COVID. It is estimated there are currently 1.8 million long COVID sufferers by May 2022 in the UK alone. The aim of this narrative literature review is to explore the signs, symptoms and diagnosis of long COVID and the potential impact on imaging services.
Key findings
Long COVID is estimated to occur in 9.5% of those with two doses of vaccination and 14.6% if those with a single dose or no vaccination. Long COVID is defined by ongoing symptoms lasting for 12 or more weeks post acute infection. Symptoms are associated with reductions in the quality of daily life and may involve multisystem manifestations or present as a single symptom.
Conclusion
The full impact of long COVID on imaging services is yet to be realised, but there is likely to be significant increased demand for imaging, particularly in CT for the assessment of lung disease. Educators will need to include aspects related to long COVID pathophysiology and imaging presentations in curricula, underpinned by the rapidly evolving evidence base.
Implications for practice
Symptoms relating to long COVID are likely to become a common reason for imaging, with a particular burden on Computed Tomography services. Planning, education and updating protocols in line with a rapidly emerging evidence base is going to be essential.

AB  - One contemporary issue is how environmental pollution and climate can affect the dissemination and severity of COVID-19 in humans. We documented the first case of association between particulate matter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) and COVID-19 mortality rates that involved rural and medium-sized municipalities in northwestern Mexico, where direct air quality monitoring is absent. Alternatively, anthropogenic PM2.5 emissions were used to estimate the PM2.5 exposure in each municipality using two scenarios: 1) considering the fraction derived from combustion of vehicle fuel; and 2) the one derived from modeled anthropogenic sources. This study provides insights to better understand and face future pandemics by examining the relation between PM2.5 pollution and COVID-19 mortality considering the population density and the wind speed. The main findings are: (i) municipalities with high PM2.5 emissions and high population density have a higher COVID-19 mortality rate; (ii) the exceptionally high COVID-19 mortality rates of the rural municipalities could be associated to dust events, which are common in these regions where soils without vegetation are dominant; and (iii) the influence of wind speed on COVID-19 mortality rate was evidenced only in municipalities with <100 inhabitants per km2. These results confirm the suggestion that high levels of air pollutants associated with high population density and an elevated frequency of dust events may promote an extended prevalence and severity of viral particles in the polluted air of urban, suburban, and rural communities. This supports an additional means of dissemination of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, in addition to the direct human-to-human transmission.
