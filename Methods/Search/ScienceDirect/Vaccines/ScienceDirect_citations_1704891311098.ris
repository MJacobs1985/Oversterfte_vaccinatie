AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seriously threatens public health safety and the global economy, which warrant effective prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. Currently, vaccination and establishment of immunity have significantly reduced the severity and mortality of COVID-19. However, in regard to COVID-19 vaccines, the broad-spectrum protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants and the blocking of virus transmission need to be further improved. In this study, an optimum oral COVID-19 vaccine candidate, rVSVΔG-Sdelta, was selected from a panel of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based constructs bearing spike proteins from different SARS-CoV-2 strains. After chitosan modification, rVSVΔG-Sdelta induced both local and peripheral antibody response, particularly, broad-spectrum and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 persisted for 1 year. Cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 WT, Beta, Delta, BA.1, and BA.2 strains was achieved in golden hamsters, which presented as significantly reduced viral replication in the respiratory tract and alleviated pulmonary pathology post SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Overall, this study provides a convenient, oral-delivered, and effective oral mucosal vaccine against COVID-19, which would supplement pools and facilitate the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased risk of baseline mortality and severe COVID-19, but analyses across CKD stages, and comorbidities are lacking. In prevalent and incident CKD, we investigated comorbidities, baseline risk, COVID-19 incidence, and predicted versus observed one-year excess death. In a national dataset (NHS Digital Trusted Research Environment [NHSD TRE]) for England encompassing 56 million individuals), we conducted a retrospective cohort study (March 2020 to March 2021) for prevalence of comorbidities by incident and prevalent CKD, SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality. Baseline mortality risk, incidence and outcome of infection by comorbidities, controlling for age, sex and vaccination were assessed. Observed versus predicted one-year mortality at varying population infection rates and pandemic-related relative risks using our published model in pre-pandemic CKD cohorts (NHSD TRE and Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD]) were compared. Among individuals with CKD (prevalent:1,934,585, incident:144,969), comorbidities were common (73.5% and 71.2% with one or more condition[s] in respective data sets, and 13.2% and 11.2% with three or more conditions, in prevalent and incident CKD), and associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly dialysis/transplantation (odds ratio 2.08, 95% confidence interval 2.04-2.13) and heart failure (1.73, 1.71-1.76), but not cancer (1.01, 1.01-1.04). One-year all-cause mortality varied by age, sex, multi-morbidity and CKD stage. Compared with 34,265 observed excess deaths, in the NHSD-TRE and CPRD databases respectively, we predicted 28,746 and 24,546 deaths (infection rates 10% and relative risks 3.0), and 23,754 and 20,283 deaths (observed infection rates 6.7% and relative risks 3.7). Thus, in this largest, national-level study, individuals with CKD have a high burden of comorbidities and multi-morbidity, and high risk of pre-pandemic and pandemic mortality. Hence, treatment of comorbidities, non-pharmaceutical measures, and vaccination are priorities for people with CKD and management of long-term conditions is important during and beyond the pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic developed the severest public health event in recent history. The first stage for defence has already been documented. This paper moves forward to contribute to the second stage for offensive by assessing the energy and environmental impacts related to vaccination. The vaccination campaign is a multidisciplinary topic incorporating policies, population behaviour, planning, manufacturing, materials supporting, cold-chain logistics and waste treatment. The vaccination for pandemic control in the current phase is prioritised over other decisions, including energy and environmental issues. This study documents that vaccination should be implemented in maximum sustainable ways. The energy and related emissions of a single vaccination are not massive; however, the vast numbers related to the worldwide production, logistics, disinfection, implementation and waste treatment are reaching significant figures. The preliminary assessment indicates that the energy is at the scale of ~1.08 × 1010 kWh and related emissions of ~5.13 × 1012 gCO2eq when embedding for the envisaged 1.56 × 1010 vaccine doses. The cold supply chain is estimated to constitute 69.8% of energy consumption of the vaccination life cycle, with an interval of 26–99% depending on haul distance. A sustainable supply chain model that responds to an emergency arrangement, considering equality as well, should be emphasised to mitigate vaccination's environmental footprint. This effort plays a critical role in preparing for future pandemics, both environmentally and socially. Research in exploring sustainable single-use or reusable materials is also suggested to be a part of the plans. Diversified options could offer higher flexibility in mitigating environmental footprint even during the emergency and minimise the potential impact of material disruption or dependency.

AB  - Objectives
French Guiana, the least-vaccinated French territory, also has the lowest COVID-19 vaccination coverage in Latin America. We aimed to estimate how many deaths, hospitalizations and costs the vaccines had and could have avoided.
Methods
We calculated the Number Needed to Vaccinate to prevent one death per year, 1 standard hospitalization, 1 Intensive Care Unit admission given the mean incidence numbers of the past 6 months, and divided the number of persons vaccinated to estimate how many deaths and hospitalizations had been avoided in French Guiana at that time.
Results
The crude number needed to vaccinate to prevent one death per year, the crude number needed to vaccinate to prevent one hospitalization per 6 months were computed Based on our observed incidence and ICU admission rate, the crude number needed to vaccinate to prevent one ICU admission per 6 months. After 6 months with an incidence exceeding 400 per million inhabitants, and 148 observed deaths, we estimate that vaccination avoided 46 deaths (IC95%=43.5–48.7). If the number of vaccinated persons had reached the same proportion as mainland France, 141 deaths per year could have been prevented (IC95%=131.9–147.6). With 2085 hospitalization and 370 ICU admissions during the same period, we estimate that the current albeit low vaccination rate avoided 300 hospital (IC95%=280–313) and 77 (IC95%=72–81) ICU admissions. With the same vaccination rates as mainland France, we estimate that 900 hospitalizations and 231 ICU admissions would have been avoided. Similarly, there would have been 139 ICU admission (instead of 370).
Conclusions
In sparsely populated French Guiana these numbers are quite substantial and framing the vaccine benefits and wasted opportunities using such concrete numbers may help convincing undecided persons to get vaccinated.

AB  - Summary
Background
Preoperative COVID-19 has been associated with excess postoperative morbi-mortality. Consequently, guidelines were developed that recommended the postponement of surgery for at least 7 weeks after the infection. We hypothesised that vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 and the large predominance of the Omicron variant attenuated the effect of a preoperative COVID-19 on the occurrence of postoperative respiratory morbidity.
Methods
We conducted a prospective cohort study in 41 French centres between 15 March and 30 May 2022 (ClinicalTrials NCT05336110), aimed at comparing the postoperative respiratory morbidity between patients with and without preoperative COVID-19 within 8 weeks prior to surgery. The primary outcome was a composite outcome combining the occurrence of pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, unexpected mechanical ventilation, and pulmonary embolism within the first 30 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, hospital length-of-stay, readmissions, and non-respiratory infections. The sample size was determined to have 90% power to identify a doubling of the primary outcome rate. Adjusted analyses were performed using propensity score modelling and inverse probability weighting.
Findings
Of the 4928 patients assessed for the primary outcome, of whom 92.4% were vaccinated against the SARS-CoV-2, 705 had preoperative COVID-19. The primary outcome was reported in 140 (2.8%) patients. An 8-week preoperative COVID-19 was not associated with increased postoperative respiratory morbidity (odds ratio 1.08 [95% CI 0.48–2.13]; p = 0.83). None of the secondary outcomes differed between the two groups. Sensitivity analyses concerning the timing between COVID-19 and surgery, and the clinical presentations of preoperative COVID-19 did not show any association with the primary outcome, except for COVID-19 patients with ongoing symptoms the day of surgery (OR 4.29 [1.02–15.8]; p = 0.04).
Interpretation
In our Omicron-predominant, highly immunised population undergoing general surgery, a preoperative COVID-19 was not associated with increased postoperative respiratory morbidity.
Funding
The study was fully funded by the French Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (SFAR).

AB  - Official statistics on deaths from COVID undercount deaths due to lack of testing. In developed countries, death registries are used to estimate excess deaths due to COVID during the pandemic. However, few developing countries had complete death registries even before the pandemic and the pandemic further stressed administrative capacities. As a substitute, we estimate all-cause excess deaths in India using the member rosters of a large, representative household panel survey. We estimate roughly 4.2 million excess deaths during the pandemic through February 2022. We cannot demonstrate causality between COVID and deaths, but the timing and age structure of deaths is consistent with the COVID pandemic and excess deaths are positively correlated with reported infections. Finally, we find that excess deaths were higher among higher-income persons and were negatively associated with mobility. The methods in this paper can be used in countries with a household panel to measure health-related demographic indicators.

AB  - Summary
Background
Although high rates of COVID-19-related deaths have been reported for people with intellectual disabilities during the first 2 years of the pandemic, it is unknown to what extent the pandemic has impacted existing mortality disparities for people with intellectual disabilities. In this study, we linked a Dutch population-based cohort that contained information about intellectual disability statuses with the national mortality registry to analyse both cause-specific and all-cause mortality in people with and without intellectual disabilities, and to make comparisons with pre-pandemic mortality patterns.
Methods
This population-based cohort study used a pre-existing cohort that included the entire Dutch adult population (everyone aged ≥18 years) on Jan 1, 2015, and identified people with presumed intellectual disabilities through data linkage. For all individuals within the cohort who died up to and including Dec 31, 2021, mortality data were obtained from the Dutch mortality register. Therefore, for each individual in the cohort, information was available about demographics (sex and date of birth), indicators of intellectual disability, if any, based on chronic care and (social) services use, and in case of death, the date and underlying cause of death. We compared the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020 and 2021) with the pre-pandemic period (2015–19). The primary outcomes in this study were all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We calculated rates of death and generated hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox regression analysis.
Findings
At the start of follow-up in 2015, 187 149 Dutch adults with indicators of intellectual disability were enrolled and 12·6 million adults from the general population were included. Mortality from COVID-19 was significantly higher in the population with intellectual disabilities than in the general population (HR 4·92, 95% CI 4·58–5·29), with a particularly large disparity at younger ages that declined with increasing age. The overall mortality disparity during the COVID-19 pandemic (HR 3·38, 95% CI 3·29–3·47) was wider than before the pandemic (3·23, 3·17–3·29). For five disease groups (neoplasms; mental, behavioural, and nervous system; circulatory system; external causes; and other natural causes) higher mortality rates were observed in the population with intellectual disabilities during the pandemic than before the pandemic, and the pre-pandemic to during the pandemic difference in mortality rates was greater in the population with intellectual disabilities than in the general population, although relative mortality risks for most other causes remained within similar ranges compared with pre-pandemic years.
Interpretation
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with intellectual disabilities has been greater than reflected by COVID-19-related deaths alone. Not only was the mortality risk from COVID-19 higher in people with intellectual disabilities than in the general population, but overall mortality disparities were also further exacerbated during the first 2 years of the pandemic. For disability-inclusive future pandemic preparedness this excess mortality risk for people with intellectual disabilities should be addressed.

AB  - Despite unprecedented progress in developing COVID-19 vaccines, global vaccination levels needed to reach herd immunity remain a distant target, while new variants keep emerging. Obtaining near universal vaccine uptake relies on understanding and addressing vaccine resistance. Simple questions about vaccine acceptance however ignore that the vaccines being offered vary across countries and even population subgroups, and differ in terms of efficacy and side effects. By using advanced discrete choice models estimated on stated choice data collected in 18 countries/territories across six continents, we show a substantial influence of vaccine characteristics. Uptake increases if more efficacious vaccines (95% vs 60%) are offered (mean across study areas = 3.9%, range of 0.6%–8.1%) or if vaccines offer at least 12 months of protection (mean across study areas = 2.4%, range of 0.2%–5.8%), while an increase in severe side effects (from 0.001% to 0.01%) leads to reduced uptake (mean = −1.3%, range of −0.2% to −3.9%). Additionally, a large share of individuals (mean = 55.2%, range of 28%–75.8%) would delay vaccination by 3 months to obtain a more efficacious (95% vs 60%) vaccine, where this increases further if the low efficacy vaccine has a higher risk (0.01% instead of 0.001%) of severe side effects (mean = 65.9%, range of 41.4%–86.5%). Our work highlights that careful consideration of which vaccines to offer can be beneficial. In support of this, we provide an interactive tool to predict uptake in a country as a function of the vaccines being deployed, and also depending on the levels of infectiousness and severity of circulating variants of COVID-19.

AB  - Cardiometabolic diseases and abnormalities have recently emerged as independent risk factors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, including hospitalizations, invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Determining whether and how this observation translates to more effective long-term pandemic mitigation strategies remains a challenge due to key research gaps. Specific pathways by which cardiometabolic pathophysiology affects humoral immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and vice versa, remain unclear. This review summarizes current evidence of the bidirectional influences between cardiometabolic diseases (diabetes, adiposity, hypertension, CVDs) and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies induced from infection and vaccination based on human studies. Ninety-two studies among >408,000 participants in 37 countries on 5 continents (Europe, Asia, Africa, and North and South America) were included in this review. Obesity was associated with higher neutralizing antibody titers following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most studies conducted prior to vaccinations found positive or null associations between binding antibodies (levels, seropositivity) and diabetes; after vaccinations, antibody responses did not differ by diabetes. Hypertension and CVDs were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Findings underscore the importance of elucidating the extent that tailored recommendations for COVID-19 prevention, vaccination effectiveness, screening, and diagnoses among people with obesity could reduce disease burden caused by SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted governments internationally to consider strengthening their public health systems. To support the work of Ireland's Public Health Reform Expert Advisory Group, the Health Information and Quality Authority, an independent governmental agency, was asked to describe the lessons learnt regarding the public health response to COVID-19 internationally and the applicability of this response for future pandemic preparedness.
Methods
Semi-structured interviews with key public health representatives from nine countries were conducted. Interviews were conducted in March and April 2022 remotely via Zoom and were recorded. Notes were taken by two researchers, and a thematic analysis undertaken.
Results
Lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic related to three main themes: 1) setting policy; 2) delivering public health interventions; and 3) providing effective communication. Real-time surveillance, evidence synthesis, and cross-sectoral collaboration were reported as essential for policy setting; it was noted that having these functions established prior to the pandemic would lead to a more efficient implementation in a health emergency. Delivering public health interventions such as testing, contact tracing, and vaccination were key to limiting and or mitigating the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, a number of challenges were highlighted such as staff capacity and burnout, delays in vaccination procurement, and reduced delivery of regular healthcare services. Clear, consistent, and regular communication of the scientific evidence was key to engaging citizens with mitigation strategies. However, these communication strategies had to compete with an infodemic of information being circulated, particularly through social media.
Conclusions
Overall, functions relating to policy setting, public health interventions, and communication are key to pandemic response. Ideally, these should be established in the preparedness phase so that they can be rapidly scaled-up during a pandemic.

AB  - Purpose
COVID-19 vaccine uptake remains low for US adolescents and contributes to excess morbidity and mortality. Most research has assessed parental intention to vaccinate their children. We explored differences between vaccine-acceptant and vaccine-hesitant unvaccinated US adolescents using national survey data.
Methods
A nonprobability, quota-based sample of adolescents, aged 13–17 years, was recruited through an online survey panel in April 2021. One thousand nine hundred twenty seven adolescents were screened for participation and the final sample included 985 responses. We assessed responses from unvaccinated adolescents (n = 831). Our primary measure was COVID-19 vaccination intent (“vaccine-acceptant” defined as “definitely will” get a COVID-19 vaccine and any other response classified as “vaccine-hesitant”) and secondary measures included reasons for intending or not intending to get vaccinated and trusted sources of COVID-19 vaccine information. We calculated descriptive statistics and chi-square tests to explore differences between vaccine-acceptant and vaccine-hesitant adolescents.
Results
Most (n = 831; 70.9%) adolescents were hesitant, with more hesitancy observed among adolescents with low levels of concern about COVID-19 and high levels of concern about side effects of COVID-19 vaccination. Among vaccine-hesitant adolescents, reasons for not intending to get vaccinated included waiting for safety data and having parents who would make the vaccination decision. Vaccine-hesitant adolescents had a lower number of trusted information sources than vaccine-acceptant adolescents.
Discussion
Differences identified between vaccine-acceptant and vaccine-hesitant adolescents can inform message content and dissemination. Messages should include accurate, age-appropriate information about side effects and risks of COVID-19 infection. Prioritizing dissemination of these messages through family members, state and local government officials, and healthcare providers may be most effective.

AB  - Summary
Background
The transmission dynamics of influenza were affected by public health and social measures (PHSMs) implemented globally since early 2020 to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to assess the effect of COVID-19 PHSMs on the transmissibility of influenza viruses and to predict upcoming influenza epidemics.
Methods
For this modelling study, we used surveillance data on influenza virus activity for 11 different locations and countries in 2017–22. We implemented a data-driven mechanistic predictive modelling framework to predict future influenza seasons on the basis of pre-COVID-19 dynamics and the effect of PHSMs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We simulated the potential excess burden of upcoming influenza epidemics in terms of fold rise in peak magnitude and epidemic size compared with pre-COVID-19 levels. We also examined how a proactive influenza vaccination programme could mitigate this effect.
Findings
We estimated that COVID-19 PHSMs reduced influenza transmissibility by a maximum of 17·3% (95% CI 13·3–21·4) to 40·6% (35·2–45·9) and attack rate by 5·1% (1·5–7·2) to 24·8% (20·8–27·5) in the 2019–20 influenza season. We estimated a 10–60% increase in the population susceptibility for influenza, which might lead to a maximum of 1–5-fold rise in peak magnitude and 1–4-fold rise in epidemic size for the upcoming 2022–23 influenza season across locations, with a significantly higher fold rise in Singapore and Taiwan. The infection burden could be mitigated by additional proactive one-off influenza vaccination programmes.
Interpretation
Our results suggest the potential for substantial increases in infection burden in upcoming influenza seasons across the globe. Strengthening influenza vaccination programmes is the best preventive measure to reduce the effect of influenza virus infections in the community.

AB  - Summary
Background
COVID-19 has worse mortality than influenza in American and European studies, but evidence from the Western Pacific region is scarce.
Methods
Using a large-scale multicenter inpatient claims data in Japan, we identified individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 in 2020 or influenza in 2017–2020. We compared patient characteristics, supportive care, and in-hospital mortality, with multivariable logistic regression analyses for in-hospital mortality overall, by age group, and among patients with mechanical ventilation.
Findings
We identified 16,790 COVID-19 patients and 27,870 influenza patients, with the different age distribution (peak at 70–89 years in COVID-19 vs. bimodal peaks at 0–9 and 80–89 years in influenza). On admission, the use of mechanical ventilation was similar in both groups (1·4% vs. 1·4%) but higher in the COVID-19 group (3·3% vs. 2·5%; p<0·0001) during the entire hospitalisation. The crude in-hospital mortality was 5·1% (856/16,790) for COVID-19 and 2·8% (791/27,870) for influenza. Adjusted for potential confounders, the in-hospital mortality was higher for COVID-19 than for influenza (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1·64–2·04). In age-stratified analyses, the aOR (95%CI) were 0·78 (0·56–1·08) and 2·05 (1·83–2·30) in patients aged 20–69 years and ≥70 years, respectively (p-for-interaction<0·0001). Among patients with mechanical ventilation, the aOR was 0·79 (0·59–1·05).
Interpretation
Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Japan were more likely to die than those with influenza. However, this was mainly driven by findings in older people, and there was no difference once mechanical ventilation was started.

AB  - Background
There are few studies demonstrating how the effectiveness of various extents of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) before and after vaccination periods. The study aimed to demonstrate such an effectiveness in the alteration of the epidemic curves from theory to practice.
Methods
The empirical data on the daily reported COVID-19 cases were extracted from open source. A computer simulation design in conjunction with the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) type model was applied to evaluating confinement measures in Italy with adjustment for underreported cases; isolation and quarantine in Taiwan; and NPIs and vaccination in Israel.
Results
In Italy scenario, the extents of confinement measures were 34% before the end of March and then scaled up to 70% after then. Both figures were reduced to 22–69% after adjusting for underreported cases. Approximately 44% of confinement measures were implemented in the second surge of pandemic in Italy. Fitting the observational data on Taiwan assuming the initial outbreak similar to Wuhan, China, 44% of isolation and quarantine were estimated before March 23rd, 2020. Isolation and quarantine were scaled up to 90% and at least 60% to contain community-acquired outbreaks from March 24th, 2020 onwards. Given 15% monthly vaccination rate from December 2020 in Israel, the effectiveness estimates of reducing the infected toll were 36%, 56%, and 85% for NPIs alone, vaccination alone, and both combined, respectively.
Conclusion
We demonstrated how various NPIs stamp out and delay the epidemic curve of COVID-19. The optimal implementation of these NPIs has to be planned before wide vaccine uptake worldwide.

AB  - Summary
Singapore developed several novel strategies to transition towards "living with COVID-19", while protecting hospital capacity. The Home Recovery Programme (HRP) was a national, centrally-administered programme that leveraged technology and telemedicine to allow low-risk individuals to safely recover at home. The HRP was subsequently expanded by partnering primary care doctors in caring for more cases in the community. A key enabler was the National Sorting Logic (NSL), a multi-step triage algorithm allowing risk-stratification of large numbers of COVID-19 patients at a national-level. At the core of the NSL was a risk assessment criterion, comprising of Comorbidities-of-concern, Age, Vaccination status, Examination/clinical findings and Symptoms (CAVES). The NSL sorted all COVID-19 cases into the various levels of care – Primary Care, HRP, COVID-19 Treatment Facility and Hospital. By adopting a national approach towards managing healthcare capacities and triaging COVID-19 patients, Singapore was able to prioritize healthcare resources for high-risk individuals and prevent hospital capacities from being overwhelmed. As part of the national response strategy to tackle COVID-19, Singapore set up and integrated key national databases to enable responsive data analysis and support evidence-based policy decisions. Using data collected between 30 August 2021 to 8 June 2022, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the outcomes and effectiveness of vaccination policies, NSL and home-based recovery. A total of 1,240,183 COVID-19 cases were diagnosed during this period, spanning both Delta and Omicron waves, Overall, Singapore experienced very low severity (0.51%) and mortality (0.11%) rates. Vaccinations significantly lowered severity and mortality risks across all age groups. The NSL was effective in predicting risk of severe outcomes and was able to right-site >93% of cases into home-based recovery. By leveraging high vaccination rates, technology and telemedicine, Singapore was able to safely navigate through two COVID-19 waves without impacting severity/mortality rates nor overwhelming hospital capacities.

AB  - The unprecedented coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has wreaked havoc across the globe. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected all countries, including government intervention programs, thus becoming a significant threat. This study aims to develop a hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (F-MCDM) model in a constrained ecosystem in response to specific government strategies and the effectiveness of interventions used in different countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. An empirical case study is conducted in India with five prospective criteria: “high acceptance among the populace”, “effectiveness in halting the COVID-19 epidemic”, “compatibility by any other standard”, “estimated total cost”, and “simple to implement”. Regarding the ranking of strategies, “vaccinations”, “social isolation”, and “development of an emergence” are the top three strategies. As a result, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have reduced COVID-19-related hospitalizations in the elderly, which has reduced post-CoVID morbidity and mortality. Many countries have different recommendations for selecting possible government initiatives and implementing those decisions. India’s strategies for developing public health policies, preventing misinformation, and managing behavior and response were ranked as the top three priorities among the listed strategies. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the validity of these results. In this work, the implications of these findings are discussed in terms of a developing nation.

AB  - Introduction
Amyloidosis is a rare disease in which malformed proteins are deposited in tissues occurring mostly commonly in older age. These deposits can lead to severe organ dysfunction e.g. in the myocardium with great impact on prognosis. The Covid-19 pandemic has caused excess mortality worldwide since 2020. Risk factors for a severe course include pre-existing cardiac diseases like heart failure and advanced age. Therefore, vaccination against Sars-CoV2 viruses is highly recommended for patients with cardiac amyloidosis. However, since there are no specific data on mRNA vaccines in patients with cardiac amyloidosis, some patients have concerns about cardiac adverse events following immunization (AEFI), such as myocarditis.
Purpose
The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines in patients with cardiac amyloidosis.
Methods
Patients of the Amyloidosis Center Charité Berlin (ACCB) were assessed about the vaccination, its tolerability and clinical effectiveness. To date, we included 62 patients (54 men) with a median age of 82,5 years (range 37 to 92). 46 patients had wtATTR amyloidosis, ten patients had hATTR amyloidosis, and six patients had AL amyloidosis. The mean systolic left ventricular function was 51% (range 30 to 62) with a mean global strain of −11,5% (range −18,5 to −3,1). The mean NT-pro-BNP was 1145 ng/l (range 24 to 48297).
Results
59 patients were triple vaccinated and three patients so far are double vaccinated. Three of the patients were unvaccinated. 171 of the vaccine doses administered were mRNA vaccines and eight doses were a viral vector-vaccine. None of the patients reported severe side effects. Thirteen patients reported feeling of pressure and pain at the injection site after vaccination and four patients had fever of maximum two days, eight patients reported lower general condition of maximum five days. One patient reported malaise for 14 days after each vaccination, which resolved spontaneously. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of suspected vaccine-induced myocarditis. Five patients reported of a COVID-19 breakthrough infection, all of which with a mild course of disease. None of the patients had symptoms of worsening heart failure in temporal relation to the vaccination. Most of the vaccinations (103) were performed at an official vaccination center, 59 were performed at a general practitioner.
Conclusion
In patients with cardiac amyloidosis, mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 are safe with respect to severe cardiac adverse events and show effective protection against clinically relevant SARS-CoV2 infection.

AB  - Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented global challenges in the health, economy, society, and political sector for the past three years. For the Netherlands, the dynamic nature of the pandemic can be divided into three phases. The initial phase exclusively relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The second phase was characterized by the introduction of vaccines alongside the continuation of stringent NPIs. Finally, the third phase marks the post-vaccine and booster stage, characterized by minimal or absent NPIs. This paper examines the interplay between the mitigation policies, the vaccination rollout, health outcomes, and economic indicators in the Netherlands in these three phases.
Methods
This analysis used national real-time data on COVID-19-related health outcomes, health service utilization, vaccination rollout, and economic indicators. Our descriptive analysis applied the “Categorising Policy & Technology Interventions (CPTI)” framework.
Results
The number of daily deaths, hospital admission and ICU admission experienced the highest peak in the first phase, while the number of daily cases first spiked in the third phase. The containment measures reached a very significant level twice, resulting in a full lockdown twice. In the first two phases, the peak in stringency of the CPTI containment category was parallel with the peaks in health outcomes. Conversely, in the third phase, the containment measures were scaled down prior to the peak in daily cases.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that the Dutch three-phased COVID-19 mitigation strategy managed to fulfil its aim and protect vulnerable individuals, prevent healthcare institutions from overload, and move from the pandemic to the endemic phase.

AB  - Summary
Background
Previous comparative analyses of people admitted to hospital for COVID-19 versus influenza evaluated the risk of death, hospital readmission, and a narrow set of health outcomes up to 6 months following infection. We aimed to do a comparative evaluation of both acute and long-term risks and burdens of a comprehensive set of health outcomes following hospital admission for COVID-19 or seasonal influenza.
Methods
For this cohort study we used the health-care databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to analyse data from 81 280 participants admitted to hospital for COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2022, and 10 985 participants admitted to hospital for seasonal influenza between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 28, 2019. Participants were followed up for up to 18 months to comparatively evaluate risks and burdens of death, a prespecified set of 94 individual health outcomes, ten organ systems, overall burden across all organ systems, readmission, and admission to intensive care. Inverse probability weighting was used to balance the baseline characteristics. Cox and Poisson models were used to generate estimates of risk on both the relative scale and absolute scale as the event rate and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per 100 persons.
Findings
Over 18 months of follow-up, compared to seasonal influenza, the COVID-19 group had an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 1·51 [95% CI 1·45–1·58]), corresponding to an excess death rate of 8·62 (95% CI 7·55–9·44) per 100 persons in the COVID-19 group versus the influenza group. Comparative analyses of 94 prespecified health outcomes showed that COVID-19 had an increased risk of 68·1% (64 of 94) pre-specified health outcomes; seasonal influenza was associated with an increased risk of 6·4% (six of 94) pre-specified health outcomes, including three out of four pre-specified pulmonary outcomes. Analyses of organ systems showed that COVID-19 had a higher risk across all organ systems except for the pulmonary system, the risk of which was higher in seasonal influenza. The cumulative rates of adverse health outcomes across all organ systems were 615·18 (95% CI 605·17–624·88) per 100 persons in COVID-19 and 536·90 (527·38–544·90) per 100 persons in seasonal influenza, corresponding to an excess rate of 78·72 (95% CI 66·15–91·24) per 100 persons in COVID-19. The total number of DALYs across all organ systems were 287·43 (95% CI 281·10–293·59) per 100 persons in the COVID-19 group and 242·66 (236·75, 247·67) per 100 persons in the seasonal influenza group, corresponding to 45·03 (95% CI 37·15–52·90) higher DALYs per 100 persons in COVID-19. Decomposition analyses showed that in both COVID-19 and seasonal influenza, there was a higher burden of health loss in the post-acute than the acute phase; and comparatively, except for the pulmonary system, COVID-19 had a higher burden of health loss across all other organ systems than seasonal influenza in both the acute and post-acute phase. Compared to seasonal influenza, COVID-19 also had an increased risk of hospital readmission (excess rate 20·50 [95% CI 16·10–24·86] per 100 persons) and admission to intensive care (excess rate 9·23 [6·68–11·82] per 100 persons). The findings were consistent in analyses comparatively evaluating risks in seasonal influenza versus COVID-19 by individuals' respective vaccination status and in those admitted to hospital during the pre-delta, delta, and omicron eras.
Interpretation
Although rates of death and adverse health outcomes following hospital admission for either seasonal influenza or COVID-19 are high, this comparative analysis shows that hospital admission for COVID-19 was associated with higher long-term risks of death and adverse health outcomes in nearly every organ system (except for the pulmonary system) and significant cumulative excess DALYs than hospital admission for seasonal influenza. The substantial cumulative burden of health loss in both groups calls for greater prevention of hospital admission for these two viruses and for greater attention to the care needs of people with long-term health effects due to either seasonal influenza or SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of social learning on the transmission of Covid-19 in a network model. We calibrate our model to detailed data for Cape Town, South Africa and show that the inclusion of social learning improves the prediction of excess fatalities, reducing the best-fit squared difference from 19.34 to 11.40. The inclusion of social learning both flattens and shortens the curves for infections, hospitalizations, and excess fatalities, which is qualitatively different from flattening the curve by reducing the contact rate or transmission probability through non-pharmaceutical interventions. While social learning reduces infections, this alone is not sufficient to curb the spread of the virus because learning is slower than the rate at which the disease spreads. We use our model to study the efficacy of different vaccination strategies and find that vaccinating vulnerable groups first leads to a 72% reduction in fatalities and a 5% increase in total infections compared to a random-order benchmark. By contrast, using a contact-based vaccination strategy reduces infections by only 0.9% but results in 42% more fatalities than the benchmark.

AB  - Transplant centers seeking to increase coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine coverage may consider requiring vaccination for healthcare workers or for candidates. The authors summarize current data to inform an ethical analysis of the harms, benefits, and individual and societal impact of mandatory vaccination, concluding that vaccine requirements for healthcare workers and transplant candidates are ethically justified by beneficence, net utility, and fiduciary duty to patients and public health. Implementation strategies should mitigate concerns about respect for autonomy and transparency for both groups. We clarify how the same arguments might be applied to related questions of caregiver vaccination, allocation of other healthcare resources, and mandates for non-COVID-19 vaccines. Finally, we call for effort to achieve global equity in vaccination as soon as possible.

KW  - rheology epidemiology
AB  - Background
Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by a dysfunctional immune response and abnormal blood rheology that contribute to endothelial dysfunction and thrombotic complications. Whole blood viscosity (WBV) is a clinically validated measure of blood rheology and an established predictor of cardiovascular risk. We hypothesize that increased WBV is associated with mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
Objectives
This study sought to determine the association between estimated BV (eBV) and mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Methods
The study population included 5,621 hospitalized COVID-19 patients at the Mount Sinai Health System from February 27, 2020, to November 27, 2021. eBV was calculated using the Walburn-Schneck model. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between eBV and mortality. Considered covariates included age, sex, race, cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities, in-house pharmacotherapy, and baseline inflammatory biomarkers.
Results
Estimated high-shear BV (eHSBV) and estimated low-shear BV were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. One-centipoise increases in eHSBV and estimated low-shear BV were associated with a 36.0% and 7.0% increase in death, respectively (P < 0.001). Compared with participants in the lowest quartile of eHSBV, those in the highest quartile of eHSBV had higher mortality (adjusted HR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.27-1.84). The association was consistent among multiple subgroups, notably among patients without any comorbidities (adjusted HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.28-2.22).
Conclusions
Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, increased eBV is significantly associated with higher mortality. This suggests that eBV can prognosticate patient outcomes in earlier stages of COVID-19, and that future therapeutics aimed at reducing WBV should be evaluated.

AB  - Background
Persons with COVID-19 infection have an increased risk of pregnancy-related complications. However, data on acute cardiovascular (CV) complications during delivery admissions remain limited.
Objectives
The purpose of this study was to determine whether pregnant individuals with COVID-19 have an increased risk of acute peripartum CV complications during their delivery admission.
Methods
This population-based retrospective cohort study used the 2020 National Inpatient Sample database. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes were used to identify delivery admissions with a diagnosis of COVID-19. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to determine the association between COVID-19 and acute peripartum CV complications at delivery.
Results
A total of 3,458,691 weighted delivery admissions were identified, of which 1.3% were among persons with COVID-19 (n = 46,375). Persons with COVID-19 were younger (median 28 vs 29 years, P < 0.01) and had a higher prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm births, and Cesarean delivery (P < 0.01). After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, insurance, and income, COVID-19 remained independently associated with peripartum CV complications including preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.33 [95% CI, 1.29-1.37]), peripartum cardiomyopathy (aOR: 2.09 [1.54-2.84]), acute coronary syndrome (aOR: 12.94 [8.85-18.90]), and arrhythmias (aOR: 1.55 [1.45-1.67]), compared with no COVID-19. Likewise, the risks of in-hospital mortality, acute kidney injury, stroke, pulmonary edema, and venous thromboembolism were higher with COVID-19. For resource utilization, the cost of hospitalization ($5,374 vs $4,837, P < 0.01) was higher for deliveries among persons with COVID-19.
Conclusions
In the year 2020, pregnant persons with COVID-19 had a higher risk of preeclampsia, in-hospital mortality, and other serious CV complication during delivery hospitalizations compared to pregnant individuals without COVID-19.

AB  - Background
Vaccine induced immune mediated thrombocytopenia or VITT, is a recent and rare phenomenon of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, frequently including cerebral venous thromboses (CVT), that has been described following vaccination with adenovirus vaccines ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 (AstraZeneca) and Ad26.COV2·S Johnson and Johnson (Janssen/J&J). The evaluation and management of suspected cases of CVT post COVID-19 vaccination are critical skills for a broad range of healthcare providers.
Methods
A collaborative comprehensive review of literature was conducted among a global group of expert neurologists and hematologists.
Findings
Strategies for rapid evaluation and treatment of the CVT in the context of possible VITT exist, including inflammatory marker measurements, PF4 assays, and non-heparin anticoagulation.

AB  - We examine the extent to which exposure to higher relative COVID-19 mortality (RM), influences health system trust (HST), and whether changes in HST explain the perceived ease of compliance with pandemic restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on evidence from two representative surveys covering all regions of 28 European countries before and after the first COVID-19 wave, and using a difference in differences strategy together with Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM), we document that living in a region with higher RM during the first wave of the pandemic increased HST. However, the positive effect of RM on HST is driven by individuals over 45 years of age, and the opposite effect is found among younger cohorts. Furthemore, we find that a higher HST reduces the costs of complying with COVID-19 restrictions, but only so long as excess mortality does not exceed the average by more than 20%, at which point the ease of complying with COVID-19 restrictions significantly declines, offsetting the positive effect of trust in the healthcare system. Our interpretation of these estimates is that a higher RM is interpreted as a risk signal among those over 45, and as a signal of health-care system failure among younger age individuals.

AB  - This paper investigated the spatiotemporal pattern of COVID-19 mortality and its socioeconomic and environmental determinants in the first and second wave of the pandemic in England. The COVID-19 mortality rates for middle super output areas from March 2020 to April 2021 were used in the analysis. SaTScan was used in the analysis of spatiotemporal pattern of COVID-19 mortality and geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) was used to investigate the association with socioeconomic and environmental factors. The results show that there was significant spatiotemporal variation in hotspots of COVID-19 deaths with the hotspots moving from regions where the COVID-19 outbreak initiated and then spread to other parts of the country. The GWPR analysis revealed that age composition, ethnic composition, deprivation, care home and pollution were all related to COVID-19 mortality. Althoughthe relationship varied over space the association with these factors was fairly consistent over the first and second wave.

AB  - Summary
Background
The effect of a fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccine on the risk of death in the oldest and frailest individuals is unknown.
Methods
Two matched cohorts were formed using Swedish nationwide registers. In the first, residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) given a fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine from 1 January 2022 onwards were matched 1:1 on birth year and county of residence to residents given at least a third dose (N = 24,524). In the second, all individuals aged ≥80 years given a fourth dose were matched 1:1 to individuals given at least a third dose (N = 394,104). Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in fourth-dose recipients as compared with in third-dose recipients, with relative vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimated as 1 minus the hazard ratio.
Findings
From 7 days after baseline and onwards, there were 1119 deaths in the LTCF cohort during a median follow-up of 77 days and a maximum follow-up of 126 days. During days 7 to 60, the VE of the fourth dose was 39% (95% CI, 29-48), which declined to 27% (95% CI, -2-48) during days 61 to 126. In the cohort of all individuals aged ≥80 years, there were 5753 deaths during a median follow-up of 73 days and a maximum follow-up of 143 days. During days 7 to 60, the VE of the fourth dose was 71% (95% CI, 69-72), which declined to 54% (95% CI, 48-60) during days 61 to 143. The VE of the fourth dose seemed stronger when it was compared to third-dose recipients where at least four months had passed since vaccination (P < 0·001 for interaction).
Interpretation
As compared with a third dose, a fourth dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, administered during the Omicron era, was associated with reduced risk of death from all causes in residents of LTCFs and in the oldest old during the first two months, after which the protection became slightly lower. These findings suggest that a fourth dose may prevent premature mortality in the oldest and frailest even after the emergence of the Omicron variant, although the timing of vaccination seems to be important with respect to the slight waning observed after two months.

AB  - Summary
Objective
Prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, influenza was the most frequent cause of viral respiratory pneumonia requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Few studies have compared the characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and influenza.
Methods
This was a French nationwide study comparing COVID-19 (March 1, 2020–June 30, 2021) and influenza patients (January 1, 2014–December 31, 2019) admitted to an ICU during pre-vaccination era. Primary outcome was in-hospital death. Secondary outcome was need for mechanical ventilation.
Results
105,979 COVID-19 patients were compared to 18,763 influenza patients. Critically ill patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be men with more comorbidities. Patients with influenza required more invasive mechanical ventilation (47 vs. 34%, p < 0·001), vasopressors (40% vs. 27, p < 0·001) and renal-replacement therapy (22 vs. 7%, p < 0·001). Hospital mortality was 25% and 21% (p < 0·001) in patients with COVID-19 and influenza, respectively. In the subgroup of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay was significantly longer in patients with COVID-19 (18 [10–32] vs. 15 [8–26] days, p < 0·001). Adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, and modified SAPS II score, in-hospital death was higher in COVID-19 patients (adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio [aSHR]=1.69; 95%CI=1.63–1.75) compared with influenza patients. COVID-19 was also associated with less invasive mechanical ventilation (aSHR=0.87; 95%CI=0.85–0.89) and a higher likelihood of death without invasive mechanical ventilation (aSHR=2.40; 95%CI=2.24–2.57).
Conclusion
Despite younger age and lower SAPS II score, critically ill COVID-19 patients had a longer hospital stay and higher mortality than patients with influenza.

AB  - Summary
Background
In late 2022, the SARS-CoV-2 omicron (B.1.1.529) BA.5 sublineage accounted for most of the sequenced viral genomes worldwide. Bivalent mRNA vaccines contain an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain component plus an updated component of the omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sublineages. Since September, 2022, a single bivalent mRNA vaccine booster dose has been recommended for adults who have completed a primary SARS-CoV-2 vaccination series and are at high risk of severe COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a bivalent mRNA vaccine booster dose to reduce hospitalisations and deaths due to COVID-19.
Methods
We did a retrospective, population-based, cohort study in Israel, using data from electronic medical records in Clalit Health Services (CHS). We included all members of CHS who were aged 65 years or older and eligible for a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccination. We used hospital records to identify COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths. The primary endpoint was hospitalisation due to COVID-19, which we compared between participants who received a bivalent mRNA booster vaccination and those who did not. A Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-dependent covariates was used to estimate the association between the bivalent vaccine and hospitalisation due to COVID-19 while adjusting for demographic factors and coexisting illnesses.
Findings
Between Sept 27, 2022, and Jan 25, 2023, 569 519 eligible participants were identified. Of those, 134 215 (24%) participants received a bivalent mRNA booster vaccination during the study period. Hospitalisation due to COVID-19 occurred in 32 participants who received a bivalent mRNA booster vaccination and 541 who did not receive a bivalent booster vaccination (adjusted hazard ratio 0·28, 95% CI 0·19–0·40). The absolute risk reduction for hospitalisations due to COVID-19 in bivalent mRNA booster recipients versus non-recipients was 0·089% (95% CI 0·075–0·101), and the number needed to vaccinate to prevent one hospitalisation due to COVID-19 was 1118 people (95% CI 993–1341).
Interpretation
Participants who received a bivalent mRNA booster vaccine dose had lower rates of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 than participants who did not receive a bivalent booster vaccination, for up to 120 days after vaccination. These findings highlight the importance of bivalent mRNA booster vaccination in populations at high risk of severe COVID-19. Further studies with longer observation times are warranted.
Funding

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a tremendous global impact both socially and economically. The mechanisms behind the disparity in the severity, vaccine coverage, and variant replacement patterns across European countries are unclear. In this work, we aim to reveal the possible reasons via data visualization and model fitting. We developed a model with a vaccination component to simulate the mortality waves in these countries. Deaths averted by the vaccination campaign were estimated. Finally, we discuss the potential reasons behind the differences in vaccine coverage across European countries. Contemporary transportation and global trade bring significant convenience to our daily life but also facilitate the spread of the novel virus COVID-19 to anywhere globally within a short time. The observations and results in this work highlight the importance of the global campaign to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics under the One Health approach.

AB  - Background & Aims
During the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease may represent a vulnerable population. We studied the etiology-based temporal trends in mortality of chronic liver disease and the underlying cause of death in the United States before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
Population-based analyses were performed on United States national mortality records (2017–2020). Temporal trends in quarterly age-standardized mortality were obtained by joinpoint analysis with estimates of quarterly percentage change (QPC).
Results
Quarterly age-standardized all-cause mortality due to alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) initially increased at a quarterly rate of 1.1% before the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a sharp increase during the COVID-19 pandemic at a quarterly rate of 11.2%. Likewise, steady increase in mortality of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease before the COVID-19 pandemic (QPC, 1.9%) accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic (QPC, 6.6%). Although ALD-related mortality increased steeply compared with viral hepatitis-related mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of mortality due to COVID-19 among individuals with ALD was the lowest at 2.5%; more than 50% lower than viral hepatitis. The significant decline in all-cause mortality due to viral hepatitis before the COVID-19 pandemic plateaued during the COVID-19 pandemic due to increase in COVID-19-related mortality in individuals with viral hepatitis. Mortality due to cirrhosis increased markedly during the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly attributable to ALD.
Conclusion
All-cause mortality for ALD and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease rapidly accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the pre-COVID-19 era. There has been a significant decline in viral hepatitis; however, a significant increase in COVID-related death in this population.

AB  - Background
Prior research has highlighted racial and ethnic disparities in H1N1 vaccination in the United States. Our study adds to this literature by utilizing an intersectionality framework to examine the joint influence of race and sex on H1N1 vaccination beliefs and behaviors among non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites (hereafter blacks and whites).
Methods
Using data from the National H1N1 Flu Survey of U.S. adults, we measured differences in beliefs about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine among black women, black men, white women, and white men. We then estimated a series of nested logistic regression models to examine how race/sex vaccination disparities were influenced by health beliefs, socioeconomic status (SES), pre-existing conditions, and healthcare.
Results
Black respondents were more likely than white respondents to express reservations about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine. Consistent with those beliefs, white females reported the highest rate of H1N1 vaccination (28.4%), followed by white males (26.3%), black males (21.6%), and black females (17.5%). Differences in health beliefs, SES, pre-existing conditions, and healthcare explained lower odds of H1N1 vaccination among white men and black men, relative to white women. However, black women experienced 35–45% lower odds of vaccination than white women across all models, highlighting the intersectional nature of these associations.
Discussion
The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provides a cautionary tale about the distribution of new vaccines across large populations with diverse racial, sex, and socioeconomic characteristics. Despite differences between the H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics, our study warns that many black Americans will forego COVID-19 vaccines unless swift action is taken to address black-white disparities in access to vital resources. Public health stakeholders can also encourage widespread adoption of COVID-19 vaccines by tailoring health promotion messages for different groups of racial minorities, especially groups like black women who face intersecting disadvantages.

AB  - Objective
This study aims to examine the interplay between high policy stringency, vaccination rates and epidemiological outcomes to develop insights on COVID-19 policy transition in Singapore
Methods
The CPTI (Categorising Policy & Technology Interventions) framework was used to classify reported interventions from January 2021 to October 2022. To analyse the impact of vaccine measures, an additional category was created. The highest monthly proportion of de-escalated measures was used as a basis to define the periods that mark the policy transition in Singapore i.e. Phase 2 and 3. Proportions of significantly escalated measures were calculated and analysed against full and booster vaccination rates, alongside epidemiological indicators – monthly total number of infections and deaths, and monthly average active hospitalisation and ICU cases.
Results
Implementation of highly stringent policies were observed to have reduced in intensity as vaccination rates picked up from Phase 2 to 3. Containment measures were the most frequently and consistently adopted beside vaccine policies. Epidemiological indicators appeared to be generally lower in Phase 3 than Phase 2. Specifically, despite reduced intensity of stringent polices, hospitalisation and ICU cases were observed to remain relatively low when vaccination rates were correspondingly higher in Phase 3 compared to Phase 2.
Conclusion
The descriptive analysis of COVID-19 policy shift in Singapore based on selected indicators preliminarily suggested its successful transition from the pandemic to endemic phase in its response strategies. A policy transition plan should consider the significance of vaccination rates in an exit strategy that protects the population against worse health outcomes.

We observed a 50% reduction in the hazard of death during both wave II and III compared with wave I (HR 0.54, 95%CI 0.39–0.74 and HR 0.57, 95%CI 0.41–0.80, respectively). Sex and age were independent predictors of death. We compare in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients admitted at our Referral Hospital of Northern Italy during the different waves, discuss the reasons of the observed differences and suggest approaches to the challenges ahead.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a huge loss of human life globally. However, few studies investigated the link between exposure to green space and risk of COVID-19 mortality rate, while also distinguishing the effects of various types of green space, considering the spatial distribution of human population and green space, and identifying the optimal buffer distances of nearby green space. It is critical and pressing to fill these significant knowledge gaps to protect and promote billions of people's health and life across the world. This study adopted a negative binomial generalized linear mixed-effects model to examine the association between the ratios of various types of green space, population-weighted exposure to those various types of green space, and COVID-19 mortality rates across 3025 counties in the USA, adjusted for sociodemographic, pre-existing chronic disease, policy and regulation, behavioral, and environmental factors. The findings show that greater exposure to forest was associated with lower COVID-19 mortality rates, while developed open space had mixed associations with COVID-19 mortality rates. Forest outside park had the largest effect size across all buffer distances, followed by forest inside park. The optimal exposure buffer distance was 1 km for forest outside park, with per one-unit of increase in exposure associated with a 9.9 % decrease in COVID-19 mortality rates (95 % confidence interval (CI): 6.9 %–12.8 %). The optimal exposure buffer distance of forest inside park was 400 m, with per one-unit of increase in exposure associated with a 4.7 % decrease in mortality rates (95 % CI: 2.4 %–6.9 %). The results suggest that greater exposure to green spaces, especially to nearby forests, may mitigate the risk of COVID-19 mortality. Although findings of an ecological study cannot be directly used to guide medical interventions, this study may pave a critical new way for future research and practice across multiple disciplines.

AB  - Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has a great impact on solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients due to their comorbidities and their maintenance immunosuppression. So far, studies about the different aspects of the impact of the pandemic on SOT recipients are limited.
Objectives
This systematic review summarizes the risk factors that make SOT patients more vulnerable for severe COVID-19 disease or mortality and the impact of immunosuppressive therapy. Furthermore, their clinical outcomes, mortality risk, immunosuppression, immunity and COVID-19 vaccination efficacy are discussed.
Methods
A systematic search on PubMed was performed to select original articles on SOT recipients concerning the following four topics: (1) mortality and clinical course; (2) risk factors for mortality and composite outcomes; (3) maintenance immunosuppression; (4) immunity to COVID-19 infection and (5) vaccine immunogenicity. Relevant data were extracted, analyzed and summarized in tables.
Results
This systematic review includes 77 articles. Mortality was associated with advanced age. Post-transplantation time or comorbidities were variably identified as independent risk factors for mortality or severe disease. However, generally, no comorbidity was reported as a major risk factor. SOT recipients have a higher risk of acute kidney injury, but no higher rate of mortality compared to non-transplanted patients was found. Immunosuppression was individually adjusted, without leading to high rates of graft dysfunction. Generally, no association between type of immunosuppression and mortality was found. SOT patients established humoral and cellular immune responses after COVID-19 disease comparable to immunocompetent people. At last, SOT patients experience a diminished immune response after two-dose vaccination with SARS-COV-2-mRNA-vaccines.
Conclusion
More research is needed to address the direct effect of COVID-19 disease on the graft in lung transplant recipients, as well as the factors ameliorating the immune response in SOT recipients.

AB  - The current coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19, is the third outbreak of disease caused by the coronavirus family, after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. It is an acute infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This severe disease is characterised by acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Currently, no drugs or vaccines exist against the disease and the only course of treatment is symptom management involving mechanical ventilation, immune suppressants, and repurposed drugs. The severe form of the disease has a relatively high mortality rate. The last six months have seen an explosion of information related to the host receptors, virus transmission, virus structure-function relationships, pathophysiology, co-morbidities, immune response, treatment and the most promising vaccines. This review takes a critically comprehensive look at various aspects of the host-pathogen interaction in COVID-19. We examine the genomic aspects of SARS-CoV-2, modulation of innate and adaptive immunity, complement-triggered microangiopathy, and host transmission modalities. We also examine its pathophysiological impact during pregnancy, in addition to emphasizing various gaps in our knowledge. The lessons learnt from various clinical trials involving repurposed drugs have been summarised. We also highlight the rationale and likely success of the most promising vaccine candidates.

AB  - Older adults in nursing homes are at greatest risk of morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nursing home residents constituted one-third to more than half of all deaths during the early waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following this, widespread adaptation of infection prevention and control measures and the supply and use of personal protective equipment resulted in a significant decrease in nursing home infections and deaths. For nursing homes, the most important determinant of experiencing a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the first instance appears to be community-transmission levels (particularly with variants of concern), although nursing home size and quality, for-profit status, and sociodemographic characteristics are also important. Use of visitation bans, imposed to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on residents, must be delicately balanced against their impact on resident, friend or family, and staff well-being. The successful rollout of primary vaccination has resulted in a sharp decrease in morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes. However, emerging evidence suggests that vaccine efficacy may wane over time, and the use of a third or additional vaccine “booster” doses in nursing home residents restores protection afforded by primary vaccination. Ongoing monitoring of vaccine efficacy in terms of infection, morbidity, and mortality is crucial in this vulnerable group in informing ongoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine boosting strategies. Here, we detail the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on nursing home residents and discuss important considerations in the management of nursing home SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. We additionally examine the use of testing strategies, nonpharmacologic outbreak control measures and vaccination strategies in this cohort. Finally, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the sector is reflected on as we emphasize the need for adoption of universal standards of medical care and integration with wider public health infrastructure in nursing homes in order to provide a safe and effective long-term care sector.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's lives worldwide. Among various strategies being applied to addressing such a global crisis, public vaccination has been arguably the most appropriate approach to control a pandemic. However, vaccine supply chain and management have become a new challenge for governments. In this study, a solution for the vaccine supply chain is presented to address the hurdles in the public vaccination program according to the concerns of the government and the organizations involved. For this purpose, a robust bi-level optimization model is proposed. At the upper level, the risk of mortality due to the untimely supply of the vaccine and the risk of inequality in the distribution of the vaccine is considered. All costs related to the vaccine supply chain are considered at the lower level, including the vaccine supply, allocation of candidate centers for vaccine injection, cost of maintenance and injection, transportation cost, and penalty cost due to the vaccine shortage. In addition, the uncertainty of demand for vaccines is considered with multiple scenarios of different demand levels. Numerical experiments are conducted based on the vaccine supply chain in Kermanshah, Iran, and the results show that the proposed model significantly reduces the risk of mortality and inequality in the distribution of vaccines as well as the total cost, which leads to managerial insights for better coordination of the vaccination network during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To describe adverse events following COVID‐19 immunisation (AEFI) and participation in AusVaxSafety surveillance in a Queensland regional community.
Methods
Participants presenting for second dose COVID‐19 vaccine at the Hervey Bay Wide Bay Hospital and Health Service (WBHHS) vaccine clinic in July 2021 completed a survey pertaining to their first COVID‐19 vaccine. Data collected included participation in AusVaxSafety surveillance, vaccine type (BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) or ChAdOx1‐S(Oxford/AstraZeneca), AEFI experienced and impact on work/routine activities. Multivariable logistic regression related demographic factors to odds of surveillance participation and AEFI occurrence.
Results
Of 1,148 participants, 37.6% participated in AusVaxSafety surveillance and 44.8% reported an AEFI. Participation in surveillance was higher in older (≥50 vs <50 years: OR 1.36, 95%CI:1.04–1.78) and less‐educated participants (university vs. high school/below: OR 0.68, 95%CI:0.48–0.95). Reporting an AEFI was higher in younger (≥50 years vs. <50 years: BNT162b2: OR 0.69, 95%CI:0.51–0.93; ChAdOx1‐S: OR 0.42, 95%CI:0.10–1.89), female (female vs. male: BNT162b2: OR 2.28, 95%CI:1.67–3.12; ChAdOx1‐S: OR 1.85, 95%CI:1.17–2.94) and more educated participants (university vs. high school/below: BNT162b2:OR 1.63, 95%CI: 1.08–2.45; ChAdOx1‐S: OR 3.98, 95%CI:2.03–7.79). Of participants with an AEFI, 15% reported missing work/routine activities.
Conclusions
Participation in surveillance was modest in this regional population, despite AEFI being frequent, and impacts of absenteeism in this setting warrants further research.
Implications for public health
The findings can inform strategies to improve surveillance participation and inform workforce planning in regional areas.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Objectives
Underlying immunodeficiency has been associated with worse clinical presentation and increased mortality in patients with COVID-19. We evaluated the mortality of solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients (SOTR) hospitalized in Spain due to COVID-19.
Methods
Nationwide, retrospective, observational analysis of all adults hospitalized because of COVID-19 in Spain during 2020. Stratification was made according to SOT status. The National Registry of Hospital Discharges was used, using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision coding list.
Results
Of the 117,694 adults hospitalized during this period, 491 were SOTR: kidney 390 (79.4%), liver 59 (12%), lung 27 (5.5%), and heart 19 (3.9%). Overall, the mortality of SOTR was 13.8%. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, SOTR was not associated with higher mortality risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60-1.03). However, lung transplantation was an independent factor related to mortality (OR = 3.26, 95% CI 1.33-7.43), while kidney, liver, and heart transplantation were not. Being a lung transplant recipient was the strongest prognostic factor in SOT patients (OR = 5.12, 95% CI 1.88-13.98).
Conclusion
This nationwide study supports that the COVID-19 mortality rate in SOTR in Spain during 2020 did not differ from the general population, except for lung transplant recipients, who presented worse outcomes. Efforts should be focused on the optimal management of lung transplant recipients with COVID-19.

Studies suggesting that vulnerability increased short-term mortality in older patients with COVID-19 enrolled hospitalized patients and lacked COVID-negative comparators. Aim of this study was to examine the relationship between frailty and 1-year mortality in older patients with and without COVID-19, hospitalized and nonhospitalized.
Design
Cohort study.
Setting and Participants
Patients over 75 years old accessing the emergency departments (ED) were identified from the ED archives in Florence, Italy.
Methods
Vulnerability status was estimated with the Dynamic Silver Code (DSC). COVID-19 hospital discharges (HC+) were compared with non-COVID-19 discharges (HC-). Linkage with a national COVID-19 registry identified nonhospitalized ED visitors with (NHC+) or without COVID-19 (NHC-).
Results
In 1 year, 48.4% and 33.9% of 1745 HC+ and 15,846 HC- participants died (P < .001). Mortality increased from 27.5% to 64.0% in HC+ and from 19.9% to 51.1% in HC- across DSC classes I to IV, with HC+ vs HC- hazard ratios between 1.6 and 2.2. Out of 1039 NHC+ and 18,722 NHC- participants, 18% and 8.7% died (P < .001). Mortality increased from 14.2% to 46.7% in NHC+ and from 2.9% to 26% in NHC- across DSC; NHC+ vs NHC- hazard ratios decreased from 5.3 in class I to 2.0 in class IV.
Conclusions and Implications
In hospitalized older patients, mortality increases with vulnerability similarly in the presence and in the absence of COVID-19. In nonhospitalized patients, vulnerability-associated excess mortality is milder in individuals with than in those without COVID-19. The disease reduces survival even when background risk is low. Thus, apparently uncomplicated patients deserve closer clinical monitoring than commonly applied.

AB  - Estimating the total coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality burden of solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs), both directly through COVID-19 infection and indirectly through other impacts on the healthcare system and society, is critical for understanding the disease’s impact on the SOTR population. Using SRTR data, we modeled expected mortality risk per month pre-COVID (January 2015–February 2020) for kidney/liver/heart/lung SOTRs, and compared monthly COVID-era deaths (March 2020–March 2021) to expected rates, overall and among subgroups. Deaths above expected rates were designated “excess deaths.” Between March 2020 and March 2021, there were 3739/827/265/252 excess deaths among kidney/liver/heart/lung SOTRs, respectively, representing a 41.2%/27.4%/18.5%/15.0% increase above expected deaths. 93.0% of excess deaths occurred in patients age≥50. The observed:expected ratio was highest among Hispanic SOTRs (1.82) and lowest among White SOTRs (1.20); 56.0% of excess deaths occurred among Black or Hispanic SOTRs. 64.7% of excess deaths occurred among patients who had survived ≥5 years post-transplant. Excess deaths peaked in January 2021; geographic distribution of excess deaths broadly mirrored COVID-19 incidence. COVID-19 likely caused over 5000 excess deaths among SOTRs in the US in a 13-month period, representing 1 in 75 SOTRs and a substantial proportion of all deaths among SOTRs during this time. SOTRs will remain at elevated mortality risk until the COVID-19 pandemic can be controlled.

AB  - Summary
Background
To inform future preventive measures including repeated vaccinations, we have searched for a clinically useful immune correlate of protection against fatal COVID-19 among nursing homes residents.
Methods
We performed repeated capillary blood sampling with analysis of S-binding IgG in an open cohort of nursing home residents in Sweden. We analyzed immunological and registry data from 16 September 2021 to 31 August 2022 with follow-up of deaths to 30 September 2022. The study period included implementation of the 3rd and 4th mRNA monovalent vaccine doses and Omicron virus waves.
Findings
A total of 3012 nursing home residents with median age 86 were enrolled. The 3rd mRNA dose elicited a 99-fold relative increase of S-binding IgG in blood and corresponding increase of neutralizing antibodies. The 4th mRNA vaccine dose boosted levels 3.8-fold. Half-life of S-binding IgG was 72 days. A total 528 residents acquired their first SARS-CoV-2 infection after the 3rd or the 4th vaccine dose and the associated 30-day mortality was 9.1%. We found no indication that levels of vaccine-induced antibodies protected against infection with Omicron VOCs. In contrast, the risk of death was inversely correlated to levels of S-directed IgG below the 20th percentile. The death risk plateaued at population average above the lower 35th percentile of S-binding IgG.
Interpretation
In the absence of neutralizing antibodies that protect from infection, quantification of S-binding IgG post vaccination may be useful to identify the most vulnerable for fatal COVID-19 among the oldest and frailest. This information is of importance for future strategies to protect vulnerable populations against neutralization resistant variants of concern.

AB  - AIMS
To assess if patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) are: a) at excess risk of undergoing testing, contracting, and dying from SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population; b) whether cardiovascular diseases (CAVDs) contribute to COVID-19-related death; and c) what is the effect of DM2 duration and control on COVID-19-related death.
METHODS
This population-based study involved all 449,440 adult residents of the Reggio Emilia province, Italy. DM2 patients were divided in groups by COVID testing, presence of CAVDs and COVID death. Several mediation analyses were performed.
RESULTS
Patients with DM2 had an increased likelihood of being tested (Odds ratio, OR 1.27 95 %CI 1.23–1.30), testing positive (OR 1.21 95 %CI 1.16–1.26) and dying from COVID-19 (OR 1.75 95 %CI 1.54–2.00). COVID-19-related death was almost three times higher among obese vs non-obese patients with DM2 (OR 4.3 vs 1.6, respectively). For COVID-19 death, CAVDs mediated a) just 5.1 % of the total effect of DM2, b) 40 % of the effect of DM2 duration, and c) did not mediate the effect of glycemic control.
CONCLUSIONS
For COVID-19-related deaths in DM2 patients, the effect is mostly direct, obesity amplifies it, DM2 control and duration are important predictors, while CAVDs only slightly mediates it.

AB  - Background
It has been hypothesised that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine may afford cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 which may contribute to the wide variability in disease severity of Covid-19.
Methods
We employed a test negative case-control study, utilising a recent measles outbreak during which many healthcare workers received the MMR vaccine, to investigate the potential protective effect of MMR against SARS-CoV-2 in 5905 subjects (n = 805 males, n = 5100 females).
Results
The odds ratio for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, in recently MMR-vaccinated compared to not recently MMR-vaccinated individuals was 0.91 (95% CI 0.76, 1.09). An interaction analysis showed a significant interaction for sex. After sex-stratification, the odds ratio for testing positive for males was 0.43 (95% CI 0.24, 0.79, P = 0.006), and 1.01 (95% CI 0.83, 1.22, P = 0.92) for females.
Conclusion
Our results indicate that there may be a protective effect of the MMR vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in males but not females.

AB  - We adopt a time series approach to investigate the historical relation between unemployment, life expectancy, and mortality rates. We fit Vector-autoregressions for the overall US population and for groups identified based on gender and race. We use our results to assess the long-run effects of the COVID-19 economic recession on mortality and life expectancy. We estimate the size of the COVID-19-related unemployment shock to be between 2 and 5 times larger than the typical unemployment shock, depending on race and gender, resulting in a significant increase in mortality rates and drop in life expectancy. We also predict that the shock will disproportionately affect African-Americans and women, over a short horizon, while the effects for white men will unfold over longer horizons. These figures translate in more than 0.8 million additional deaths over the next 15 years.

AB  - Since 2019, the coronavirus outbreak has caused many catastrophic events all over the world. At the current time, the massive vaccination has been considered as the most efficient way to fight against the pandemic. This study schemes to explain and model COVID-19 cases by considering the vaccination rate. We utilized an amalgamation of neural network (NN) with two powerful optimization algorithms, i.e., firefly algorithm and artificial bee colony. For validating the models, we employed the COVID-19 datasets regarding the vaccination rate and the total confirmed cases for 51 states since the beginning of vaccination in the US. The numerical experiment indicated that by considering the vaccinated population, the accuracy of NN increases exponentially when compared with the same NN in the absence of the vaccinated population. During the next stage, the NN with vaccinated input data is elected for firefly and bee optimizing. Based upon the firefly optimizing, 93.75% of COVID-19 cases can be explained in all states. According to the bee optimizing, 92.3% of COVID-19 cases is explained since the massive vaccination. Overall, it can be concluded that the massive vaccination is the key predictor of COVID-19 cases on a grand scale.

AB  - Aim
The purpose of this study is to determine the value-based price of a COVID-19 vaccine from a societal perspective in Germany.
Methods
A decision model was constructed using, e.g., information on age-specific fatality rates, intensive care unit (ICU) costs and outcomes, and the full vaccination rate. Three strategies were analysed: vaccination (with 95 % and 50 % efficacy against death), a mitigation strategy, and no intervention. The base-case time horizon was 5 years. The value of a vaccine includes savings from avoiding COVID-19 mitigation measures and productivity loss, as well as health benefits from preventing COVID-19 related mortality. The value of an additional life year was borrowed from new, innovative oncological drugs, as cancer reflects a condition with a similar morbidity and mortality burden in the general population in the short term as COVID-19.
Results
A vaccine with a 95 % efficacy dominates the mitigation strategy strictly. The value-based price (€6,431) is thus determined by the comparison between vaccination and no intervention. The price is particularly sensitive to the full vaccination rate and the duration of vaccine protection. In contrast, the value of a vaccine with 50 % efficacy is more ambiguous.
Conclusion
This study yields a value-based price for a COVID-19 vaccine with 95 % efficacy, which is considerably greater than the purchasing price.

AB  - Background
Vaccine-associated anaphylaxis is a rare event (1.34 events/million doses; 0.00017% occurrence over 26 years). Several reports of allergic reactions concerning for anaphylaxis have been reported early into the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine campaign in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
Objective
To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis characterizing the risks of COVID-19 versus vaccine anaphylaxis, comparing universal COVID-19 vaccination versus risk-stratified vaccination approaches.
Methods
Cohort analysis models were created to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination versus risk-stratified vaccination (eg, contraindicated in persons with a history of any previous episode of anaphylaxis) with a threshold for cost-effective care at $10,000,000 per death prevented. In the base case, risk of anaphylaxis was estimated at 0.1%, with case-fatality estimated at 0.3%.
Results
On a population level (n = 300,000,000 simulated persons), universal vaccination was associated with a cost-savings of $503,596,316 and saved 7,607 lives, but the cost-savings was sensitive to increasing rates of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis. The universal strategy dominated at higher rates of COVID-19 infection and low rates of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis in both the health care and societal perspectives. When the risk of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis exceeded 0.8%, the risk-stratified approach to vaccination was the most cost-effective strategy. There was also an interaction between anaphylaxis risk and anaphylaxis fatality, with a risk-stratified approach becoming cost-effective as each risk increased concurrently. Stratified observation time by anaphylaxis history (15 minutes vs 30 minutes) was not cost-effective until a 1% anaphylaxis case-fatality was assumed and risk of vaccine anaphylaxis exceeded 6%.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that unless vaccine anaphylaxis rates exceed 0.8%, a universal vaccination approach dominates a risk-stratified approach where persons with any history of anaphylaxis would be contraindicated from vaccination, with lower cost and superior health outcomes.

AB  - Background
Israel began a mass vaccination program with the rapid rollout of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 BNT162b2 vaccine for adults. At the same time, government stringency measures in terms of closing public life were decreased. Our objective was to estimate the total number of Covid-19 deaths avoided due to the massive vaccination campaign in the elderly Israeli population.
Methods
We examined the effect of vaccination on mortality when at least 90% of the population over age 70 were vaccinated for less than seven months. Projected deaths as expected from vaccine efficacy and actual mortality data were compared for the study population to account for potential confounding effects of government stringency. The average Oxford Stringency Index was calculated in the study period and the preceding period of the pandemic. Potential confounding effects of an age shift in the distribution of deaths were examined by analyzing the distributions before and after the study period.
Results
Confirmed deaths from COVID-19 in the population over 70 after mass vaccination were recorded as 370, versus 5,120 estimated without vaccinations.
Conclusions
Vaccines against COVID-19 saved more lives than expected by simply applying individual vaccine efficacy to the vaccinated population in Israel, despite a loosening of government stringency. Our findings support the worldwide efforts of governments to improve vaccination rates, especially in the elderly population.

AB  - Summary
COVID-19 has exacerbated endemic health inequalities resulting in a syndemic pandemic of higher mortality and morbidity rates among the most socially disadvantaged. We did a scoping review to identify and synthesise published evidence on geographical inequalities in COVID-19 mortality rates globally. We included peer-reviewed studies, from any country, written in English that showed any area-level (eg, neighbourhood, town, city, municipality, or region) inequalities in mortality by socioeconomic deprivation (ie, measured via indices of multiple deprivation: the percentage of people living in poverty or proxy factors including the Gini coefficient, employment rates, or housing tenure). 95 papers from five WHO global regions were included in the final synthesis. A large majority of the studies (n=86) found that COVID-19 mortality rates were higher in areas of socioeconomic disadvantage than in affluent areas. The subsequent discussion reflects on how the unequal nature of the pandemic has resulted from a syndemic of COVID-19 and endemic inequalities in chronic disease burden.

KW  - residential aged care facilities
AB  - Objectives
During the COVID-19 pandemic, no country with widespread community transmission has avoided outbreaks or deaths in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). As RACF residents are at high risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, understanding disease severity risk factors is imperative.
Design
This retrospective cohort study aimed to compare COVID-19 disease severity (hospitalization and deaths) and associated risk factors among RACF residents in Victoria, Australia, across Delta and Omicron epidemic periods.
Settings and Participants
Resident case hospitalization risk (HR) and case fatality risk (CFR) were assessed using Victorian RACFs COVID-19 outbreaks data across 2 epidemic periods; Delta, 994 resident cases linked to 86 outbreaks; and Omicron, 1882 resident cases linked to 209 outbreaks.
Methods
Adjusting for outbreak-level clustering, age, sex, up-to-date vaccination status, and time since last vaccination, the odds of hospitalization and death were compared using mixed effects logistic regression.
Results
The HR and CFR was lower during the Omicron period compared with the Delta period [HR 8.2% vs 24.6%, odds ratio (OR) 0.17, 95% CI 0.11-0.26, and CFR: 11.4% vs 18.7%, OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.28-0.56]. During both periods, males had higher odds of hospitalization and odds of death; being up to date with vaccination reduced odds of hospitalization by 40% (excluding nonemergency patient transfers) and odds of death by 43%; and for each month since last vaccination, odds of hospitalization increased by 9% and odds of death by 16%.
Conclusions and Implications
This study provides empirical evidence of lower COVID-19 severity among RACF residents in the Omicron period and highlights the importance of up-to-date and timely vaccination to reduce disease severity in this cohort.

We obtained data from the electronic health records of all individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 in the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) or were hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection in five UPHS hospitals from March 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021. The main predictors were race/ethnicity and neighbourhood-level social vulnerability. The main outcomes were COVID-19 test positivity, hospitalization with COVID-19, and 30-day in-hospital mortality following hospitalization with COVID-19.
Findings
A total of 225,129 unique individuals received COVID-19 testing and 18,995 had a positive test result. A total of 5,794 unique patients were hospitalized with COVID-19 and 511 died in-hospital within 30 days. Racial/ethnic minority groups and residents of higher social vulnerability neighbourhoods had higher test positivity and risk of hospitalization. We did not see in-hospital mortality disparities during the first wave but observed 75% and 68% higher odds of death among Hispanic and Asians compared to Whites during subsequent waves.
Interpretation
We observed significant racial/ethnic and neighbourhood disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, especially test positivity and odds of hospitalization, highlighting the importance of equitably improving access to preventive measures to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection, including reducing exposure to the virus and ensuring equity in vaccination.

AB  - Summary
Background
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a critical risk factor for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, and SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to worsening glycemic control. The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly disrupted the delivery of care for patients with diabetes. We aimed to determine the trend of DM-related deaths during the pandemic.
Methods
In this serial population-based study between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2021, mortality data of decedents aged ≥25 years from the National Vital Statistics System dataset was analyzed. Decedents with DM as the underlying or contributing cause of death on the death certificate were defined as DM-related deaths. Excess deaths were estimated by comparing observed versus expected age-standardized mortality rates derived from mortality during 2006-2019 with linear and polynomial regression models. The trends of mortality were quantified with joinpoint regression analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and state.
Findings
Among 4·25 million DM-related deaths during 2006-2021, there was a significant surge of more than 30% in mortality during the pandemic, from 106·8 (per 100,000 persons) in 2019 to 144·1 in 2020 and 148·3 in 2021. Adults aged 25-44 years had the most pronounced rise in mortality. Widened racial/ethnic disparity was observed, with Hispanics demonstrating the highest excess deaths (67·5%; 95% CI 60·9-74·7%), almost three times that of non-Hispanic whites (23·9%; 95% CI 21·2-26·7%).
Interpretation
The United States saw an increase in DM-related mortality during the pandemic. The disproportionate rise in young adults and the widened racial/ethnic disparity warrant urgent preventative interventions from diverse stakeholders.

AB  - During the pandemic period, health care systems were substantially reorganized for managing COVID-19 cases. Corresponding consequences on persons with chronic diseases remain insufficiently documented. This observational cohort study investigated the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic period on the survival of kidney transplant recipients (KTR). Using the French National Health Data System, incident persons with end-stage kidney disease between 2015 and 2020, and who received a kidney transplant during this period were included and followed up from their transplantation date to December 31, 2021. The survival of KTR during the prepandemic and pandemic periods was investigated using Cox models with time-dependent covariates. There were 10 637 KTR included in the study, with 324 and 430 deaths observed during the prepandemic and pandemic periods, respectively. The adjusted risk of death during the pandemic period was similar to that observed during the prepandemic period (hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval]: 0.92 [0.77-1.11]), COVID-19–related hospitalization was associated with an increased risk of death (HR: 10.62 [8.46-13.33]), and a third vaccine dose was associated with a lower risk of death (HR: 0.42 [0.30-0.57]). The pandemic period was not associated with an indirect higher risk of death in KTR with no COVID-19–related hospitalization.

AB  - Background
We aimed to evaluate cumulative occurrence and impact of COVID-19 in patients with chronic respiratory failure (CRF) treated with long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT).
Material and methods
Data were obtained from the SCIFI-PEARL study on the entire Swedish population and on patients with oxygen-dependent CRF and no COVID-19 diagnosis before start of LTOT. Analyses were performed for three time periods; pre-alpha (Jan–Dec 2020), alpha (Jan–Mar 2021) and delta/omicron (Apr 2021–May 2022). Cumulative incidence of laboratory-verified COVID-19 was compared between patients with CRF and the general population. Risk factors for severe (hospitalised) to critical (intensive care, or death ≤30 days after infection) COVID-19, and the impact of COVID-19 on one-year mortality, were analysed using multivariable Cox regression.
Results
Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was higher in patients with CRF than in the general population during the pre-alpha period (6.4%/4.9%, p = 0.002), but less common during the alpha and delta/omicron periods (2.9%/3.8% and 7.8%/15.5%, p < 0.0001 for both). The risk of severe/critical COVID-19 was much higher in CRF patients during all periods (4.9%/0.5%, 3.8%/0.2% and 15.5%/0.5%, p < 0.0001 for all). Risk factors for COVID-19 infection in people with CRF were higher age, cardiovascular and renal disease, and COVID-19 was associated with increased one-year mortality following infection in the pre-alpha (HR 1.79; [95% CI] 1.27–2.53) and alpha periods (1.43; 1.03–1.99).
Conclusion
Patients with CRF had higher risk of severe/critical COVID-19 than the general population. COVID-19 infection was associated with excess one-year mortality.

KW  - mortality
AB  - Background
In-hospital mortality in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is higher in those with COVID-19 than in those without COVID-19. The factors that predispose to this mortality rate and their relative contribution are poorly understood. This study developed a risk score inclusive of clinical variables to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 and STEMI.
Methods
Baseline demographic, clinical, and procedural data from patients in the North American COVID-19 Myocardial Infarction registry were extracted. Univariable logistic regression was performed using candidate predictor variables, and multivariable logistic regression was performed using backward stepwise selection to identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Independent predictors were assigned a weighted integer, with the sum of the integers yielding the total risk score for each patient.
Results
In-hospital mortality occurred in 118 of 425 (28%) patients. Eight variables present at the time of STEMI diagnosis (respiratory rate of >35 breaths/min, cardiogenic shock, oxygen saturation of <93%, age of >55 ​years, infiltrates on chest x-ray, kidney disease, diabetes, and dyspnea) were assigned a weighted integer. In-hospital mortality increased exponentially with increasing integer risk score (Cochran-Armitage χ2, P ​< ​.001), and the model demonstrated good discriminative power (c-statistic ​= ​0.81) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow, P ​= ​.40). The increasing risk score was strongly associated with in-hospital mortality (3.6%-60% mortality for low-risk and very high–risk score categories, respectively).
Conclusions
The risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 and STEMI can be accurately predicted and discriminated using readily available clinical information.

AB  - Background
Countries have adopted different COVID-19 policies to contain the transmission of the disease and to prepare for vaccination rollout. Countries’ political context, vaccine policy history, and health systems’ responses impacted COVID-19 health outcomes.
Objective
This study focused on synthesizing and examining COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions in Brazil and Portugal, understanding the enablers and barriers to COVID-19 vaccination access and distribution, and health and non-health outcomes across three time-points: before vaccination, during mass vaccination, and after the declaration of endemicity.
Methods
Extensive qualitative document analysis of secondary sources published in Portuguese and English over the past three years, and examination of primary publicly available epidemiological data since the beginning of the pandemic.
Results
In the first year of the pandemic, the COVID-19 government response between the two countries was dissimilar; effective coordination, trust in the government response and political alignment in Portugal contrasted the political denial of the pandemic, lack of coordination between the various levels of government, at the same time the Brazilian population engaged in protective behaviours and distrusted the government. The COVID-19 vaccination had a good response from the public, associated with a primary care level network of distribution, low vaccine hesitancy, and strong childhood immunization programs before the pandemic in both countries. Vaccine manufacturing in Brazil and the strong support from the European Union to Portugal on vaccine acquisition have also aided these countries in achieving high COVID-19 vaccination coverage.
Conclusion
Future policies to promote a well-functioning and resilient health system should consider medical and nursing workforce sustainability, equity in all policies, building public trust, strengthening health system governance, and improving preparedness and surveillance.

AB  - Excess inflammation and oxidative stress are common themes in many pathologies of pregnancy including preeclampsia and more recently severe COVID-19. The risk of preeclampsia increases following maternal infection with COVID-19, potentially relating to significant overlap in pathophysiology with endothelial, vascular and immunological dysfunction common to both. Identifying a therapy which addresses these injurious processes and stabilises the endothelial and vascular maternal system would help address the significant global burden of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality they cause. Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring phytonutrient found most densely within cruciferous vegetables. It has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immune modulating properties via upregulation of phase-II detoxification enzymes. This review will cover the common pathways shared by COVID-19 and preeclampsia and offer a potential therapeutic target via nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor upregulation in the form of sulforaphane.

AB  - Summary
Background
Before widespread vaccination, the United States was disproportionately affected by COVID-19 with a mortality rate several times that of other affluent societies. Comparing regions with different rates of health insurance, we assess how much of this excess mortality may be due to the relatively large population without health insurance.
Methods
We use daily surveillance data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stratified by region, age group, gender, and race in regression analysis of daily COVID-19 cases, hospitalization, and mortality. COVID-19 data have been matched with structural characteristics of the region including average proportion with health insurance. As checks, we have estimated regressions for different time periods, different groups of states, and by comparing adjacent counties between states with and without Medicaid expansion.
Findings
Groups with lower health insurance coverage had significantly higher mortality as well as greater case counts and hospitalization. Early in the pandemic, they were also less likely to be tested for COVID-19. Applying our regression estimates, we estimate that had there been full health insurance coverage of the population, there would have been 60,000 fewer deaths, 26% of the total death toll in the period of this analysis.
Interpretation
Our study demonstrates that a significant share of COVID-19 mortality in the United States, and much of the excess mortality in the United States compared with other countries, is due to our reliance on a system of market-driven healthcare. Providing universal insurance coverage should be part of our campaign to reduce COVID-19 mortality. It also suggests that these concerns should not be restricted to COVID-19 but apply across all diseases, contributing to many unnecessary deaths in the United States each year even apart from the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Objectives
Indigenous populations have been disproportionately affected during pandemics. We investigated COVID-19 mortality estimates among indigenous and non-indigenous populations at national and sub-national levels in Mexico.
Methods
We obtained data from the Ministry of Health, Mexico, on 2,173,036 laboratory-confirmed RT-PCR positive COVID-19 cases and 238,803 deaths. We estimated mortality per 1000 person-weeks, mortality rate ratio (RR) among indigenous vs. non-indigenous groups, and hazard ratio (HR) for COVID-19 deaths across four waves of the pandemic, from February 2020 to March 2022. We also assessed differences in the reproduction number (Rt).
Results
The mortality rate among indigenous populations of Mexico was 68% higher than that of non-indigenous groups. Out of 32 federal entities, 23 exhibited higher mortality rates among indigenous groups (P < 0.05 in 13 entities). The fourth wave showed the highest RR (2.40). The crude HR was 1.67 (95% CI: 1.62, 1.72), which decreased to 1.08 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.11) after controlling for other covariates. During the intense fourth wave, the Rt among the two groups was comparable.
Conclusion
Indigenous status is a significant risk factor for COVID-19 mortality in Mexico. Our findings may reflect disparities in non-pharmaceutical (e.g., handwashing and using facemasks), and COVID-19 vaccination interventions among indigenous and non-indigenous populations in Mexico.

AB  - Summary
Background & aims
Concomitantly to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in the child population there was already another pandemic wave in progress: childhood obesity. Numerous studies in adults have been carried out and describe obesity as an independent risk and prognostic factor for the severity of COVID-19. This study aims to systematically review the literature on the relation between weight excess and the severity of COVID-19 in children and adolescents.
Methods
This systematic review was developed following the PRISMA standards (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis). The literature search was performed in September 2020, in the following databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Scopus, The Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)), Web of Science, BVS/LILACS and SciELO. Registration on the PROSPERO platform (International Prospective Registry of Systematic Reviews) can be found under the registration number: CRD42021230686.
Results
Of the 667 selected articles, 11 were included according to all agreed criteria, most of them being unicentric and American. In assessing the risk of bias and quality, following the criteria of the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale, eight studies achieved scores higher than 7. Only 5 studies sought to assess obesity and its relation with worse outcomes (such as need for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), mechanical ventilation (MV), tracheostomy, hospital readmission and mortality), and out of these, only one article demonstrated this comorbidity as a prognostic factor for worse evolution of the COVID picture.
Conclusions
Few studies in the literature seek to assess excess weight and its relation with worse outcomes of COVID-19 in children and adolescents. Taking into account that there is already scientific evidence on this subject in adult patients, it is necessary to carry out more research in the pediatric age group.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has profound adverse effects on the population on dialysis. Patients requiring dialysis are at an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality, and many have experienced psychological distress as well as delayed or suboptimal care. COVID-19 survivors have prolonged viral shedding, but generally develop a robust and long-lasting humoral immune response that correlates with initial disease severity. However, protection against reinfection is incomplete. A growing body of evidence reveals delayed and blunted immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Administration of a third dose within 1 to 2 months of prime-boost vaccination significantly increases antibody levels, in particular in patients with poor initial responses. Patients on dialysis have inferior immune responses to adenoviral vector vaccines than to mRNA vaccines. The immunogenicity of the mRNA-1273 vaccine is markedly better than that of the BNT162b2 vaccine, most likely by virtue of its higher mRNA content. Despite suboptimal immune responses in patients on dialysis, preliminary data suggest that vaccination partially protects against infection and severe disease requiring hospitalization. However, progressive waning of immunity and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with a high potential of immune escape call for a booster dose in all patients on dialysis 4 to 6 months after prime-boost vaccination. Patients with persistent poor vaccine responses may be candidates for primary prophylaxis strategies. In the absence of specific data in patients on dialysis, therapeutic strategies in the event of established COVID-19 must be extrapolated from evidence obtained in the population not on dialysis. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies may be an attractive option after a high-risk exposure or during the early course of infection.

AB  - Summary
Background
National immunisation programmes globally are at risk of suspension due to the severe health system constraints and physical distancing measures in place to mitigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to compare the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa with the risk of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection through visiting routine vaccination service delivery points.
Methods
We considered a high-impact scenario and a low-impact scenario to approximate the child deaths that could be caused by immunisation coverage reductions during COVID-19 outbreaks. In the high-impact scenario, we used previously reported country-specific child mortality impact estimates of childhood immunisation for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, rotavirus, measles, meningitis A, rubella, and yellow fever to approximate the future deaths averted before 5 years of age by routine childhood vaccination during a 6-month COVID-19 risk period without catch-up campaigns. In the low-impact scenario, we approximated the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation on only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks during the COVID-19 risk period. We assumed that contact-reducing interventions flattened the outbreak curve during the COVID-19 risk period, that 60% of the population will have been infected by the end of that period, that children can be infected by either vaccinators or during transport, and that upon child infection the whole household will be infected. Country-specific household age structure estimates and age-dependent infection-fatality rates were applied to calculate the number of deaths attributable to the vaccination clinic visits. We present benefit–risk ratios for routine childhood immunisation, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
Findings
In the high-impact scenario, for every one excess COVID-19 death attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections acquired during routine vaccination clinic visits, 84 (95% UI 14–267) deaths in children could be prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa. The benefit–risk ratio for the vaccinated children is 85 000 (4900–546 000), for their siblings (<20 years) is 75 000 (4400–483 000), for their parents or adult carers (aged 20–60 years) is 769 (148–2700), and for older adults (>60 years) is 96 (14–307). In the low-impact scenario that approximates the health benefits to only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks, the benefit–risk ratio to the households of vaccinated children is 3 (0·5–10); if the risk to only the vaccinated children is considered, the benefit–risk ratio is 3000 (182–21 000).
Interpretation
The deaths prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa outweigh the excess risk of COVID-19 deaths associated with vaccination clinic visits, especially for the vaccinated children. Routine childhood immunisation should be sustained in Africa as much as possible, while considering other factors such as logistical constraints, staff shortages, and reallocation of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Summary
Background
Long-term projections of cancer incidence and mortality estimate the future burden of cancer in a population, and can be of great use in informing the planning of health services and the management of resources. We aimed to estimate incidence and mortality rates and numbers of new cases and deaths up until 2044 for all cancers combined and for 21 individual cancer types in Australia. We also illustrate the potential effect of treatment delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic on future colorectal cancer mortality rates.
Methods
In this statistical modelling study, cancer incidence and mortality rates in Australia from 2020 to 2044 were projected based on data up to 2017 and 2019, respectively. Cigarette smoking exposure (1945–2019), participation rates in the breast cancer screening programme (1996–2019), and prostate-specific antigen testing rates (1994–2020) were included where relevant. The baseline projection model using an age-period-cohort model or generalised linear model for each cancer type was selected based on model fit statistics and validation with pre-COVID-19 observed data. To assess the impact of treatment delays during the COVID-19 pandemic on colorectal cancer mortality, we obtained data on incidence, survival, prevalence, and cancer treatment for colorectal cancer from different authorities. The relative risks of death due to system-caused treatment delays were derived from a published systematic review. Numbers of excess colorectal cancer deaths were estimated using the relative risk of death per week of treatment delay and different durations of delay under a number of hypothetical scenarios.
Findings
Projections indicate that in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic effects, the age-standardised incidence rate for all cancers combined for males would decline over 2020–44, and for females the incidence rate would be relatively stable in Australia. The mortality rates for all cancers combined for both males and females are expected to continuously decline during 2020–44. The total number of new cases are projected to increase by 47·4% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 35·2–61·3) for males, from 380 306 in 2015–19 to 560 744 (95% UI 514 244–613 356) in 2040–44, and by 54·4% (95% UI 40·2–70·5) for females, from 313 263 in 2015–19 to 483 527 (95% UI 439 069–534 090) in 2040–44. The number of cancer deaths are projected to increase by 36·4% (95% UI 15·3–63·9) for males, from 132 440 in 2015–19 to 180 663 (95% UI 152 719–217 126) in 2040–44, and by 36·6% (95% UI 15·8–64·1) for females, from 102 103 in 2015–19 to 139 482 (95% UI 118 186–167 527) in 2040–44, due to population ageing and growth. The example COVID-19 pandemic scenario of a 6-month health-care system disruption with 16-week treatment delays for colorectal cancer patients could result in 460 (95% UI 338–595) additional deaths and 437 (95% UI 314–570) deaths occurring earlier than expected in 2020–44.
Interpretation
These projections can inform health service planning for cancer care and treatment in Australia. Despite the continuous decline in cancer mortality rates, and the decline or plateau in incidence rates, our projections suggest an overall 51% increase in the number of new cancer cases and a 36% increase in the number of cancer deaths over the 25-year projection period. This means that continued efforts to increase screening uptake and to control risk factors, including smoking exposure, obesity, physical inactivity, alcohol use, and infections, must remain public health priorities.

AB  - Despite never imposing a lockdown, Taiwan achieved COVID-19 zero, with reporting only 56 local coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases after testing 126,987 individuals in 2020, and further contained a large outbreak rapidly and successfully in 2021. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, our infectious disease modeling results indicated that testing and contact tracing alone would fail to contain the pandemic. However, by supplementing this approach with general public surgical mask-wearing, the reproduction number (R0) could be suppressed to less than 1. This would effectively contain the virus's spread within Taiwan, particularly when combined with strict border control measures to prevent the overwhelming influx of imported COVID-19 cases and ensure the capacity of the medical and public health systems remains resilient. These modeling results became the theoretical basis behind the highly successful Taiwan model against COVID-19 during 2020–2021, supporting by negative excess mortality, seroepidemiological surveys, and molecular epidemiological analyses. This is a public health triumph demonstrating that a democratic and humane approach to the COVID-19 pandemic is not only feasible but highly effective. It also highlights the crucial role of infectious disease modeling in assisting the formulation of a successful national pandemic response.

AB  - Objectives
Mass COVID-19 vaccination commenced in December 2020 in Scotland. Monitoring vaccine safety relies on accurate background incidence rates (IRs) for health outcomes potentially associated with vaccination. This study aimed to quantify IRs in Scotland of adverse events of special interest (AESI) potentially associated with COVID-19 vaccination.
Study design and methods
IRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 36 AESI were calculated retrospectively for the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period (01 January 2015–31 December 2019) and the COVID-19 pandemic period (01 April 2020–30 November 2020), with age-sex stratification, and separately by calendar month and year. Incident cases were determined using International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10)–coded hospitalisations.
Results
Prepandemic population-wide IRs ranged from 0.4 (0.3–0.5 CIs) cases per 100,000 person-years (PYRS) for neuromyelitis optica to 478.4 (475.8–481.0 CIs) cases per 100,000 PYRS for acute renal failure. Pandemic population-wide IRs ranged from 0.3 (0.2–0.5 CIs) cases per 100,000 PYRS for Kawasaki disease to 483.4 (473.2–493.7 CIs) cases per 100,000 PYRS for acute coronary syndrome. All AESI IRs varied by age and sex. Ten AESI (acute coronary syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, heart failure, multiple sclerosis, polyneuropathies and peripheral neuropathies, respiratory failure, rheumatoid arthritis and polyarthritis, seizures and vasculitis) had lower pandemic than prepandemic period IRs overall. Only deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism had a higher pandemic IR.
Conclusion
Lower pandemic IRs likely resulted from reduced health-seeking behaviours and healthcare provision. Higher IRs may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections. AESI IRs will facilitate future vaccine safety studies in Scotland.

AB  - Summary
Background
Residents in care homes have been severely impacted by COVID-19. We describe trends in the mortality risk among residents of care homes compared to private homes.
Methods
On behalf of NHS England we used OpenSAFELY-TPP to calculate monthly age-standardised risks of death due to all causes and COVID-19 among adults aged >=65 years between 1/2/2019 and 31/03/2021. Care home residents were identified using linkage to Care and Quality Commission data.
Findings
We included 4,340,648 people aged 65 years or older on the 1st of February 2019, 2.2% of whom were classified as residing in a care or nursing home. Age-standardised mortality risks were approximately 10 times higher among care home residents compared to those in private housing in February 2019: comparative mortality figure (CMF) = 10.59 (95%CI = 9.51, 11.81) among women, and 10.87 (9.93, 11.90) among men. By April 2020 these relative differences had increased to more than 17 times with CMFs of 17.57 (16.43, 18.79) among women and 18.17 (17.22, 19.17) among men. CMFs did not increase during the second wave, despite a rise in the absolute age-standardised COVID-19 mortality risks.
Interpretation
COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on the mortality of care home residents in England compared to older residents of private homes, but only in the first wave. This may be explained by a degree of acquired immunity, improved protective measures or changes in the underlying frailty of the populations. The care home population should be prioritised for measures aimed at controlling COVID-19.

AB  - Introduction
Optimized allocation of medical resources to patients with COVID-19 has been a critical concern since the onset of the pandemic.
Methods
In this retrospective cohort study, the authors used data from a Brazilian tertiary university hospital to explore predictors of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and hospital mortality in patients admitted for COVID-19. Our primary aim was to create and validate prediction scores for use in hospitals and emergency departments to aid clinical decisions and resource allocation.
Results
The study cohort included 3,022 participants, of whom 2,485 were admitted to the ICU; 1968 survived, and 1054 died in the hospital. From the complete cohort, 1,496 patients were randomly assigned to the derivation sample and 1,526 to the validation sample. The final scores included age, comorbidities, and baseline laboratory data. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were very similar for the derivation and validation samples. Scores for ICU admission had a 75% accuracy in the validation sample, whereas scores for death had a 77% accuracy in the validation sample. The authors found that including baseline flu-like symptoms in the scores added no significant benefit to their accuracy. Furthermore, our scores were more accurate than the previously published NEWS-2 and 4C Mortality Scores.
Discussion and conclusions
The authors developed and validated prognostic scores that use readily available clinical and laboratory information to predict ICU admission and mortality in COVID-19. These scores can become valuable tools to support clinical decisions and improve the allocation of limited health resources.

AB  - Objective
Persons with serious mental illness (SMI: schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder) experience increased risk of mortality after contracting COVID-19 based on the results of several international evaluations. However, information about COVID-19 mortality risk among patients with SMI in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has been limited, precluding identification of protective factors. The current evaluation was conducted to assess COVID-19 mortality risk among VHA patients with SMI and to evaluate potential protective factors in mitigating mortality risk following a positive COVID-19 diagnosis.
Methods
National VHA administrative data was used to identify all patients (N = 52,916) who received a positive COVID-19 test result between March 1, 2020, and September 30, 2020. Mortality risk was assessed by SMI status via bivariate comparisons and multivariate regression analyses.
Results
In unadjusted analyses, VHA patients with SMI overall and patients with bipolar disorder in particular did not experience increased mortality risk in the 30 days following a positive COVID test, although patients with schizophrenia had increased risk. Within adjusted analyses, patients with schizophrenia remained at increased mortality risk (OR = 1.38), but at reduced levels relative to previous evaluations in other healthcare settings.
Conclusions
Within VHA, patients with schizophrenia, but not those with bipolar disorder, experience increased mortality risk in the 30 days following a positive COVID-19 test. Large integrated healthcare settings such as VHA may offer services which may protect against COVID-19 mortality for vulnerable groups such as persons with SMI. Additional work is needed to identify practices which may reduce the risk of COVID-19 mortality among persons with SMI.

AB  - Summary
Background
The dynamics of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 are complicated by age-dependent factors, changing levels of infection, and the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as the perceived risk declines, necessitating the use of mathematical models. Our aims were to use epidemiological data from the UK together with estimates of vaccine efficacy to predict the possible long-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 under the planned vaccine rollout.
Methods
In this study, we used a mathematical model structured by age and UK region, fitted to a range of epidemiological data in the UK, which incorporated the planned rollout of a two-dose vaccination programme (doses 12 weeks apart, protection onset 14 days after vaccination). We assumed default vaccine uptake of 95% in those aged 80 years and older, 85% in those aged 50–79 years, and 75% in those aged 18–49 years, and then varied uptake optimistically and pessimistically. Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease was assumed to be 88% on the basis of Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines being administered in the UK, and protection against infection was varied from 0% to 85%. We considered the combined interaction of the UK vaccination programme with multiple potential future relaxations (or removals) of NPIs, to predict the reproduction number (R) and pattern of daily deaths and hospital admissions due to COVID-19 from January, 2021, to January, 2024.
Findings
We estimate that vaccination alone is insufficient to contain the outbreak. In the absence of NPIs, even with our most optimistic assumption that the vaccine will prevent 85% of infections, we estimate R to be 1·58 (95% credible intervals [CI] 1·36–1·84) once all eligible adults have been offered both doses of the vaccine. Under the default uptake scenario, removal of all NPIs once the vaccination programme is complete is predicted to lead to 21 400 deaths (95% CI 1400–55 100) due to COVID-19 for a vaccine that prevents 85% of infections, although this number increases to 96 700 deaths (51 800–173 200) if the vaccine only prevents 60% of infections. Although vaccination substantially reduces total deaths, it only provides partial protection for the individual; we estimate that, for the default uptake scenario and 60% protection against infection, 48·3% (95% CI 48·1–48·5) and 16·0% (15·7–16·3) of deaths will be in individuals who have received one or two doses of the vaccine, respectively.
Interpretation
For all vaccination scenarios we investigated, our predictions highlight the risks associated with early or rapid relaxation of NPIs. Although novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 offer a potential exit strategy for the pandemic, success is highly contingent on the precise vaccine properties and population uptake, both of which need to be carefully monitored.

AB  - Scientists across the world are diligently seeking vaccines and cures for the novel SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) virus, which causes severe respiratory disease. Traditional medicine was found to have a significant therapeutic effect on recovering Covid-19 patients when combined with the infusion of corticosteroids, antivirals, and convalescent plasma. Here, we cover the contribution and effects of traditional medicine on Covid-19 patients. Early detection of Covid-19 and common safety precautions are among the infection prevention and control (IPC) techniques. The Covid-19 prevention methods include facemasks, social distancing, and vaccinations and are discussed. In addition, the survey of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, telemedicine, exposure detection via mobile apps, and electronic corona passport are also addressed. Although the vaccination pipeline looks promising in ending the Covid-19 infections, this review also provides awareness in the possibility of Covid-19 transmission within the community and the environmental impact of the pandemic.

AB  - Analyzing the COVID-19 pandemic is a critical factor in developing effective policies to deal with similar challenges in the future. However, many parameters (e.g., the actual number of infected people, the effectiveness of vaccination) are still subject to considerable debate because they are unobservable. To model a pandemic and estimate unobserved parameters, researchers use compartmental models. Most often, in such models, the transition rates are considered as constants, which allows simulating only one epidemiological wave. However, multiple waves have been reported for COVID-19 caused by different strains of the virus. This paper presents an approach based on the reconstruction of real distributions of transition rates using genetic algorithms, which makes it possible to create a model that describes several pandemic peaks. The model is fitted on registered COVID-19 cases in four countries with different pandemic control strategies (Germany, Sweden, UK, and US). Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was chosen as the objective function, the MAPE values of 2.168%, 2.096%, 1.208% and 1.703% were achieved for the listed countries, respectively. Simulation results are consistent with the empirical statistics of medical studies, which confirms the quality of the model. In addition to observables such as registered infected, the output of the model contains variables that cannot be measured directly. Among them are the proportion of the population protected by vaccines, the size of the exposed compartment, and the number of unregistered cases of COVID-19. According to the results, at the peak of the pandemic, between 14% (Sweden) and 25% (the UK) of the population were infected. At the same time, the number of unregistered cases exceeds the number of registered cases by 17 and 3.4 times, respectively. The average duration of the vaccine induced immune period is shorter than claimed by vaccine manufacturers, and the effectiveness of vaccination has declined sharply since the appearance of the Delta and Omicron strains. However, on average, vaccination reduces the risk of infection by about 65–70%.

AB  - Objectives
This article describes the prevalence and epidemiological trends of COVID-19 mortality in the largest registry in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).
Study design
A prospective epidemiological cohort study using data from all healthcare facilities in KSA collected between March 23, 2020, and April 30, 2022. Data on the number of daily deaths directly related to COVID-19 were gathered, analyzed, and reported.
Method
Data analysis was carried out using national and regional crude case fatality rate and death per 100,000 population. Descriptive statistics using numbers and proportions were used to describe age, gender, nationality, and comorbidities. The mortality trend was plotted and compared with international figures. In addition, the most common comorbidities associated with mortality and the proportion of patients who received COVID-19 vaccine were reported.
Results
The total reported number of deaths between March 23, 2020, and April 30, 2022, was 9085. Crude case fatality rate was 1.21%, and death per 100,000 population was 25.38, which compared favorably to figures reported by several developed countries. The highest percentages of deaths were among individuals aged between 60 and 69 years, males (71%), and individuals with diabetes (60%). Only 2.8% of mortalities occur in patients who received COVID-19 vaccine. Diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure had the highest attributable risk of mortality among patients who died due to COVID-19.
Conclusion
Case fatality rate and death per 100,000 population in KSA are among the lowest in the world due to multiple factors. Several comorbidities have been identified, namely, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and cardiac arrhythmias.

AB  - Background
The electrocardiography (ECG) has short-term prognostic value in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet its ability to predict long-term mortality is unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the predictive role of initial ECG on long-term all-cause mortality in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
Methods
In this prospective cohort study, adults with COVID-19 who underwent ECG testing within a 17-hospital health system in Northeast Ohio and Florida between 03/2020-06/2020 were identified. An expert ECG reader analyzed all studies blinded to patient status. The associations of ECG characteristics with long-term all-cause mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression model and multivariable logistic regression models, respectively. Status of long-term mortality was adjudicated on 01/07/2022.
Results
Of 837 patients (median age 65 years, 51% female, 44% Black), 683 (81.6%) were hospitalized, 281 (33.6%) required ICU admission, 67 (8.0%) died in-hospital, and 206 (24.6%) died at final follow-up after a median (IQR) of 21 (9-103) days after ECG. Overall, 179 (20.7%) patients presented with sinus tachycardia, 12 (1.4%) with atrial flutter, and 45 (5.4%) with atrial fibrillation (AF). After multivariable adjustment, sinus tachycardia (E-value for HR=3.09, lower CI=2.2) and AF (E-value for HR=3.13, lower CI=2.03) each independently predicted all-cause mortality. At final follow-up, patients with AF had 64.5% probability of death compared with 20.5% for those with normal sinus rhythm (P<.0001).
Conclusions
Sinus tachycardia and AF on initial ECG strongly predict long-term all-cause mortality in COVID-19. The ECG can serve as a powerful long-term prognostic tool in COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
Background
It is unclear what effect the pattern of health-care use before admission to hospital with COVID-19 (index admission) has on the long-term outcomes for patients. We sought to describe mortality and emergency readmission to hospital after discharge following the index admission (index discharge), and to assess associations between these outcomes and patterns of health-care use before such admissions.
Methods
We did a national, retrospective, complete cohort study by extracting data from several national databases and linking the databases for all adult patients admitted to hospital in Scotland with COVID-19. We used latent class trajectory modelling to identify distinct clusters of patients on the basis of their emergency admissions to hospital in the 2 years before the index admission. The primary outcomes were mortality and emergency readmission up to 1 year after index admission. We used multivariable regression models to explore associations between these outcomes and patient demographics, vaccination status, level of care received in hospital, and previous emergency hospital use.
Findings
Between March 1, 2020, and Oct 25, 2021, 33 580 patients were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in Scotland. Overall, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of mortality within 1 year of index admission was 29·6% (95% CI 29·1–30·2). The cumulative incidence of emergency hospital readmission within 30 days of index discharge was 14·4% (95% CI 14·0–14·8), with the number increasing to 35·6% (34·9–36·3) patients at 1 year. Among the 33 580 patients, we identified four distinct patterns of previous emergency hospital use: no admissions (n=18 772 [55·9%]); minimal admissions (n=12 057 [35·9%]); recently high admissions (n=1931 [5·8%]), and persistently high admissions (n=820 [2·4%]). Patients with recently or persistently high admissions were older, more multimorbid, and more likely to have hospital-acquired COVID-19 than patients with no or minimal admissions. People in the minimal, recently high, and persistently high admissions groups had an increased risk of mortality and hospital readmission compared with those in the no admissions group. Compared with the no admissions group, mortality was highest in the recently high admissions group (post-hospital mortality HR 2·70 [95% CI 2·35–2·81]; p<0·0001) and the risk of readmission was highest in the persistently high admissions group (3·23 [2·89–3·61]; p<0·0001).
Interpretation
Long-term mortality and readmission rates for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were high; within 1 year, one in three patients had died and a third had been readmitted as an emergency. Patterns of hospital use before index admission were strongly predictive of mortality and readmission risk, independent of age, pre-existing comorbidities, and COVID-19 vaccination status. This increasingly precise identification of individuals at high risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19 will enable targeted support.

AB  - Background:
Excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with those expected from historical trends have been unequally distributed, both geographically and socioeconomically. Not all excess deaths have been directly related to COVID-19 infection. We investigated geographical and socioeconomic patterns in excess deaths for major groups of underlying causes during the pandemic.
Methods:
Weekly mortality data from 27/12/2014 to 2/10/2020 for England and Wales were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. Negative binomial regressions were used to model death counts based on pre-pandemic trends for deaths caused directly by COVID-19 (and other respiratory causes) and those caused indirectly by it (cardiovascular disease or diabetes, cancers, and all other indirect causes) over the first 30 weeks of the pandemic (7/3/2020–2/10/2020).
Findings:
There were 62,321 (95% CI: 58,849 to 65,793) excess deaths in England and Wales in the first 30 weeks of the pandemic. Of these, 46,221 (95% CI: 45,439 to 47,003) were attributable to respiratory causes, including COVID-19, and 16,100 (95% CI: 13,410 to 18,790) to other causes. Rates of all-cause excess mortality ranged from 78 per 100,000 in the South West of England and in Wales to 130 per 100,000 in the West Midlands; and from 93 per 100,000 in the most affluent fifth of areas to 124 per 100,000 in the most deprived. The most deprived areas had the highest rates of death attributable to COVID-19 and other indirect deaths, but there was no socioeconomic gradient for excess deaths from cardiovascular disease/diabetes and cancer.
Interpretation:
During the first 30 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic there was significant geographic and socioeconomic variation in excess deaths for respiratory causes, but not for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Pandemic recovery plans, including vaccination programmes, should take account of individual characteristics including health, socioeconomic status and place of residence.

AB  - Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic evolved in 2 consecutive waves during 2020. Improvements in the management of COVID-19 led to a reduction in mortality rates among hospitalized patients during the second wave. Whether this progress benefited kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), a population particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19, remained unclear.
Methods
In France, 957 KTRs were hospitalized for COVID-19 in 2020 and their data were prospectively collected into the French Solid Organ Transplant (SOT) COVID registry. The presentation, management, and outcomes of the 359 KTRs diagnosed during the first wave were compared to those of the 598 of the second wave.
Results
Baseline comorbidities were similar between KTRs of the 2 waves. Maintenance immunosuppression was reduced in most patients but withdrawal of antimetabolite (73.7% vs. 58.4%, P < 0.001) or calcineurin inhibitor (32.1% vs. 16.6%, P < 0.001) was less frequent during the second wave. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin that were commonly used during the first wave (21.7% and 30.9%, respectively) but were almost abandoned during the second wave. In contrast, the use of high dose corticosteroids doubled (19.5% vs. 41.6%, P < 0.001). Despite these changing trends in COVID-19 management, 60-day mortality was not statistically different between the 2 waves (25.3% vs. 23.9%; Log Rank, P = 0.48) and COVID-19 hospitalization period was not associated with death due to COVID-19 in multivariate analysis (Hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.67–1.17, P = 0.4).
Conclusion
We conclude that changing of therapeutic trends during 2020 did not reduce COVID-19 related mortality among KTRs. Our data indirectly support the importance of vaccination and neutralizing monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to protect KTRS from severe COVID-19.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Introduction
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a premalignant disorder causing monoclonal plasma cell proliferation in bone marrow. This population is at risk of developing multiple myeloma (MM) and severe viral infections; risk factors of severe COVID-19 infection. Using TriNetX, a global platform providing data of 120 million patients, we aimed to quantify the risk and severity of COVID-19 in MGUS patients.
Patients and Methods
A retrospective cohort analysis was performed using the TriNetX Global Collaborative Network. From January 20, 2020, to January 20, 2023, we identified a cohort of 58,859 MGUS patients and compared to non-MGUS patients, determined by relevant diagnosis/LOINC test codes. After 1:1 propensity score-matching, we identified COVID-19 cases to quantify risk and identify patients who had been hospitalized, ventilated/intubated, and deceased to quantify severity. Measures of association and Kaplan-Meier analysis were conducted.
Results
After propensity-score matching, there were 58,668 patients in both cohorts. MGUS patients were found to be at a reduced risk of contracting COVID-19 (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.85-0.91). MGUS patients with COVID-19 showed higher mortality risk and decreased survival time compared to the general population (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.27). MGUS patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized exhibited significantly decreased survival time (log-rank test, P = 0.04).
Conclusion
As COVID-19 remains a looming health concern, especially amongst vulnerable populations, our analysis emphasizes the need for adequate vaccination and treatment regimens as well as an understanding of the severity of infection in MGUS patients and justification for precautionary measures.

AB  - Background
Significant disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality exist for Native American (NA) people, the majority of whom live in urban areas. COVID-19 vaccination is a key strategy for mitigating these disparities; however, vaccination disparities affect NA communities. The current study investigated COVID-19 vaccine decision-making before widespread vaccine rollout occurred, among urban NA communities. We aimed to understand vaccine decision-making factors to develop recommendations about COVID-19 vaccine outreach.
Methods
We conducted three in-depth virtual focus groups with 17 NA adults living in an urban community (Los Angeles County) between December 2020 and January 2021. Participants were recruited through NA community-based organizations and community stakeholders. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted using Atlas.ti.
Findings
Participants in this study identified two overarching themes with implications for health vaccination campaigns. First, participants described a need for tailored information and outreach, including NA vaccine outreach that addresses misconceptions about vaccine development to calm fears of experimentation and support communication of vaccine evidence specific to NA people. Second, participants suggested strategies to improve public health resources in the urban NA community, such as the need for unified, proactive communication across trusted NA entities, navigation support to improve vaccine accessibility, and adequately resourcing health partnerships with and among trusted NA community agencies for improved reach.
Conclusion
In this qualitative study, we found that urban NA participants reported several factors that affected their vaccine decision-making, including a lack of tailored information for their communities. Our findings also underscore the need to work with tribes, tribal leadership, and urban NA serving organizations to coordinate vaccine communication and distribution to urban communities where the majority of NAs now reside. Further, these findings have implications for COVID-19 vaccine outreach among urban NA communities and demonstrate the need for clear and tailored engagement about the COVID-19 vaccine.

AB  - The AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine is associated with Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) in 3/100,000 vaccinations with high fatality rates reported in many countries. We conducted a risk–benefit analysis for Australians aged 18–59 years, comparing the risk of vaccination versus infection, and rate of TTS to other vaccines which prompted policy change following rare adverse events – rotavirus, smallpox and oral polio vaccines. COVID-19 deaths over 12 months range from 0 to 417 in current and future worst case scenarios. In the past 15 months 20 COVID-19 deaths occurred in people < 60 years compared to 890 deaths over 60 years. The estimated possible number of TTS cases is 347, with vaccine-related deaths ranging from 17 to 153if 80% of adults 18–59 years are vaccinated. The reported rate of TTS is in the same range as rare but serious adverse events associated with other vaccines that have been subject to policy change. In Australia, the potential risks of the AZD1222 vaccine in younger adults, who are at low risk of dying from COVID-19, may outweigh the benefits.

AB  - Background
Cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of sudden out-of-hospital death after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. Such unexpected COVID-19-related cardiomyopathies are challenging to diagnose as specific pathological findings are not always identified.
Case summary
We reported the autopsy findings of two cases of sudden death due to COVID-19-related cardiomyopathies. In one case, death occurred after SARS-CoV-2 infection, while in the other, after COVID-19 vaccination. We found common pathological findings in both hearts: decreased staining intensity with special stains, loss of rhabdomeres, and multivacuolation in cardiomyocytes without inflammatory cell infiltration. The remaining organs showed no findings that could have contributed to the deaths.
Conclusion
In cases of sudden death after SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination, the decreased staining intensity with special stains may aid the diagnosis of sudden death due to COVID-19-related cardiomyopathy, even when H&E staining shows few findings.

AB  - Objectives
Few studies report contributors to the excess mortality in England during the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. We report the absolute excess risk (AER) of mortality and excess mortality rate (EMR) from a nationally representative COVID-19 sentinel surveillance network including known COVID-19 risk factors in people aged 45 years and above.
Methods
Pseudonymised, coded clinical data were uploaded from contributing primary care providers (N = 1,970,314, ≥45years). We calculated the AER in mortality by comparing mortality for weeks 2 to 20 this year with mortality data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) from 2018 for the same weeks. We conducted univariate and multivariate analysis including preselected variables. We report AER and EMR, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
Results
The AER of mortality was 197.8/10,000 person years (95%CI:194.30–201.40). The EMR for male gender, compared with female, was 1.4 (95%CI:1.35–1.44, p<0.00); for our oldest age band (≥75 years) 10.09 (95%CI:9.46–10.75, p<0.00) compared to 45–64 year olds; Black ethnicity's EMR was 1.17 (95%CI: 1.03–1.33, p<0.02), reference white; and for dwellings with ≥9 occupants 8.01 (95%CI: 9.46–10.75, p<0.00). Presence of all included comorbidities significantly increased EMR. Ranked from lowest to highest these were: hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic respiratory and heart disease, and cancer or immunocompromised.
Conclusions
The absolute excess mortality was approximately 2 deaths per 100 person years in the first wave of COVID-19. More personalised shielding advice for any second wave should include ethnicity, comorbidity and household size as predictors of risk.

AB  - A growing number of studies report associations between air pollution and COVID-19 mortality. Most were ecological studies at the county or regional level which disregard important local variability and relied on data from only the first few months of the pandemic. Using COVID-19 deaths identified from death certificates in California, we evaluated whether long-term ambient air pollution was related to weekly COVID-19 mortality at the census tract-level during the first ∼12 months of the pandemic. Weekly COVID-19 mortality for each census tract was calculated based on geocoded death certificate data. Annual average concentrations of ambient particulate matter <2.5 μm (PM2.5) and <10 μm (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) over 2014–2019 were assessed for all census tracts using inverse distance-squared weighting based on data from the ambient air quality monitoring system. Negative binomial mixed models related weekly census tract COVID-19 mortality counts to a natural cubic spline for calendar week. We included adjustments for potential confounders (census tract demographic and socioeconomic factors), random effects for census tract and county, and an offset for census tract population. Data were analyzed as two study periods: Spring/Summer (March 16-October 18, 2020) and Winter (October 19, 2020–March 7, 2021). Mean (standard deviation) concentrations were 10.3 (2.1) μg/m3 for PM2.5, 25.5 (7.1) μg/m3 for PM10, 11.3 (4.0) ppb for NO2, and 42.8 (6.9) ppb for O3. For Spring/Summer, adjusted rate ratios per standard deviation increase were 1.13 (95% confidence interval: 1.09, 1.17) for PM2.5, 1.16 (1.11, 1.21) for PM10, 1.06 (1.02, 1.10) for NO2, and 1.09 (1.04, 1.14) for O3. Associations were replicated in Winter, although they were attenuated for PM2.5 and PM10. Study findings support a relation between long-term ambient air pollution exposure and COVID-19 mortality. Communities with historically high pollution levels might be at higher risk of COVID-19 mortality.

AB  - Background
Post-marketing surveillance studies have raised concerns of increased myocarditis rates following coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) mRNA vaccines. The present study aims to accumulate the published mRNA Covid-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis cases, describe their clinical characteristics and determine the factors predisposing to critical illness.
Methods
Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, CENTRAL and Google Scholar were systematically searched from inception. Studies reporting adult myocarditis cases following BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccination were included. Individual participant data coming from case reports/series were pooled. Proportional random-effects meta-analysis was conducted by combining the pooled cohort and observational studies with aggregated data.
Results
Overall, 39 studies were included with a total of 129 patients. Most cases occurred in young males after the second vaccine dose. Myocarditis after the first dose was significantly associated with prior Covid-19 (p-value: 0.025). The most common electrocardiographic finding was ST-segment elevation, while late gadolinium enhancement was invariably observed in cardiac magnetic reasoning. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that signs of heart failure were predictive of subsequent critical illness (Odds ratio: 19.22, 95% confidence intervals-CI: 5.57–275.84). Proportion meta-analysis indicated that complete resolution of symptoms is achieved in 80.5% of patients (95% CI: 59.3–92.1), while the proportion of participants necessitating intensive care unit admission is 7.0% (95% CI: 3.8–12.9).
Conclusions
Myocarditis following mRNA Covid-19 vaccination is typically mild, following an uncomplicated clinical course with rapid improvement of symptoms. Future research is needed to define its exact incidence, clarify its pathophysiology and determine the optimal management plan depending on its severity.

AB  - During outbreaks, natural disasters, and any unexpected event, it is usual that public authorities face issues tracking the outcomes, and the available reports of casualties tend to be lower than actual numbers. Using weekly data at the municipality level in São Paulo State (the most densely populated region in Brazil), we employ stochastic frontier methods to fit the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak spanning from March 2020 to December 2021. The empirical model incorporates the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation to address the issue of zero reporting of COVID-19 deaths. Furthermore, we utilize a flexible frontier method to capture the S-shaped epidemic curve in two distinct waves of infections/deaths. Our results reveal that the actual death toll resulting from COVID-19 is, on average, 1.24 times higher than the officially reported figures. Consequently, these findings hold significant implications for public authorities in identifying regions characterized by substantial under-reporting of COVID-19 fatalities. Moreover, this study presents an empirical framework that can be used for other municipalities, states, or countries confronting outbreak scenarios.

AB  - Summary
Measles vaccine (MV) has been observed to reduce all-cause mortality more than explained by prevention of measles infection. Recently, prevention of “measles-induced immune amnesia” (MIA) has been proposed as an explanation for this larger-than-anticipated beneficial effect of measles vaccine (MV). According to the “MIA hypothesis”, immune amnesia leads to excess non-measles morbidity and mortality, that may last up to five years after measles infection, but may be prevented by MV. However, the benefits of MV-vaccinated children could also be due to beneficial non-specific effects (NSEs) of MV, reducing the risk of non-measles infections (The “NSE hypothesis"). The epidemiological studies do provide some support for MIA, as exposure to measles infection before 6 months of age causes long-term MIA, and over 6 months of age for 2–3 months. However, in children over 6 months of age, the MIA hypothesis is contradicted by several epidemiological patterns: First, in community studies that adjusted for MV status, children surviving acute measles infection had lower mortality than uninfected controls (44%(95%CI: 0–69%)). Second, in six randomised trials and six observational studies comparing MV-vaccinated and MV-unvaccinated children, the benefit of MV changed minimally from 54%(43–63%) to 49%(37–59%) when measles cases were censored in the survival analysis, making it unlikely that prevention of measles and its long-term consequences explained much of the reduced mortality. Third, several studies conducted in measles-free contexts still showed significantly lower mortality after MV (55%(40–67%)). Fourth, administration of MV in the presence of maternal measles antibody (MatAb) is associated with much stronger beneficial effect for child survival than administration of MV in the absence of MatAb (55%(35–68%) lower mortality). The MIA hypothesis alone cannot explain the strongly beneficial effects of MV on child survival. Conversely, the hypothesis that MV has beneficial non-specific immune training effects is compatible with all available data. Consideration should be given to continuing MV even when measles has been eradicated.

We assessed short-, medium-, and long-term all-cause mortality risks after a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods
A national, matched, retrospective cohort study was conducted in Qatar to assess risk of all-cause mortality in the national SARS-CoV-2 primary infection cohort compared with the national infection-naïve cohort. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. Analyses were stratified by vaccination status and clinical vulnerability status.
Results
Among unvaccinated persons, within 90 days after primary infection, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) comparing mortality incidence in the primary-infection cohort with the infection-naïve cohort was 1.19 (95% confidence interval 1.02-1.39). aHR was 1.34 (1.11-1.63) in persons more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19 and 0.94 (0.72-1.24) in those less clinically vulnerable. Beyond 90 days after primary infection, aHR was 0.50 (0.37-0.68); aHR was 0.41 (0.28-0.58) at 3-7 months and 0.76 (0.46-1.26) at ≥8 months. The aHR was 0.37 (0.25-0.54) in more clinically vulnerable persons and 0.77 (0.48-1.24) in less clinically vulnerable persons. Among vaccinated persons, mortality incidence was comparable in the primary-infection versus infection-naïve cohorts, regardless of clinical vulnerability status.
Conclusions
COVID-19 mortality was primarily driven by an accelerated onset of death among individuals who were already vulnerable to all-cause mortality, but vaccination prevented these accelerated deaths.

AB  - Summary
Background
The Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, part of the UK Government Department of Health and Social Care, highlighted an emerging signal of increased non-COVID-19-related deaths in England between July and October, 2021, with a potentially disproportionate higher increase in people with diabetes. We aimed to substantiate and quantify this apparent excess mortality, and to investigate the association between diabetes routine care delivery and non-COVID-19-related-mortality in people with diabetes before and after the onset of the pandemic.
Methods
In this population-based parallel cohort study, we used the National Diabetes Audit (NDA) to identify people with diabetes in England. The primary outcome was non-COVID-19-related deaths between July 3, 2021, and Oct 15, 2021, in participants in the 2021 COVID-19 cohort (registered in the NDA in the periods Jan 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020, and Jan 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021) compared with deaths between June 29, 2019, and Oct 11, 2019 (the equivalent 15-week period in 2019) in the 2019 pre-COVID-19 comparator cohort (people registered in the NDA in the periods Jan 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018, and Jan 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019). In each cohort, multivariable logistic regression examined whether completion of eight diabetes care processes in each of the two years before the index mortality year was associated with non-COVID-19-related death, adjusting for diabetes type, age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic deprivation.
Findings
There were 3 218 570 people in the 2021 cohort and 2 973 645 people in the 2019 comparator cohort. In the 2021 cohort, there were 30 118 non-COVID-19-related deaths in people with diabetes, compared with 27 132 in the comparator cohort, representing an 11% increase (95% CI 9–13). The unadjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) for mortality in the 2021 cohort compared to the 2019 cohort was 1·026 (1·009–1·043; p=0·003), which was unchanged after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and diabetes type (IRR 1·023 (1·006–1·040); p=0·007). In the 2021 cohort, 853 660 (26·5%) people received all eight care processes in 2020–21 compared with 1 547 240 (48·1%) people in 2019–20; a 44·8% (95% CI 44·7–45·0) relative reduction. In the pre-COVID-19 comparator cohort, 1 370 315 (46·1%) people with diabetes received all eight care processes in 2018–19 compared with 1 437 740 (48·3%) in 2017–18; a 4·7% (95% CI 4·5–4·9) relative decrease. Non-COVID-19-related mortality in the 2021 cohort was highest in people who did not receive all eight care processes in either of the two previous years (OR 2·67 [95% CI 2·56–2·77]; p<0·001) compared with those who received all eight care processes in both previous years. Mortality was also significantly higher in those who received all eight care processes in 2019–20 but not in 2020–21 (OR 1·66 [95% CI 1·59–1·73]; p<0·001) or not in 2019–20 but in 2020–21 (OR 1·27 [1·20–1·35]; p<0·001). This pattern of association was similar in the 2019 pre-COVID-19 cohort.
Interpretation
Our results show an increased risk of mortality in those who did not receive all eight care processes in one or both of the previous two years. Our results provide evidence that the increased rate of non-COVID-19-related mortality in people with diabetes in England observed between July 3, and Oct 15 of 2021 is associated with a reduction in completion of routine diabetes care processes following the pandemic onset in 2020.
