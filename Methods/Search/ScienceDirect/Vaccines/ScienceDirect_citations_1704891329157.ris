AB  - COVID-19-infected individuals and those who recovered from the infection have been demonstrated to have elevated liver enzymes or abnormal liver biochemistries, particularly with preexisting liver diseases, liver metabolic disorders, viral hepatitis, and other hepatic comorbidities. However, possible crosstalk and intricate interplay between COVID-19 and liver disease severity are still elusive, and the available data are murky and confined. Similarly, the syndemic of other blood-borne infectious diseases, chemical-induced liver injuries, and chronic hepatic diseases continued to take lives while showing signs of worsening due to the COVID-19 crisis. Moreover, the pandemic is not over yet and is transitioning to becoming an epidemic in recent years; hence, monitoring liver function tests (LFTs) and assessing hepatic consequences of COVID-19 in patients with or without liver illnesses would be of paramount interest. This pragmatic review explores the correlations between COVID-19 and liver disease severity based on abnormal liver biochemistries and other possible mechanisms in individuals of all ages from the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic to the post-pandemic period. The review also alludes to clinical perspectives of such interactions to curb overlapping hepatic diseases in people who recovered from the infection or living with long COVID-19.

AB  - COVID-19 has spread worldwide with a high variability in cases and mortality between populations. This research aims to assess socioeconomic inequities of COVID-19 in the city of Cali, Colombia, during the first and second peaks of the pandemic in this city. An ecological study by neighborhoods was carried out, were COVID-19 cases were analyzed using a Bayesian hierarchical spatial model that includes potential risk factors such as the index of unsatisfied basic needs and socioeconomic variables as well as random effects to account for residual variation. Maps showing the geographic patterns of the estimated relative risks as well as exceedance probabilities were created. The results indicate that in the first wave, the neighborhoods with the greatest unsatisfied basic needs and low socioeconomic strata, were more likely to report positive cases for COVID-19. For the second wave, the disease begins to spread through different neighborhoods of the city and middle socioeconomic strata presents the highest risk followed by the lower strata. These findings indicate the importance of measuring social determinants in the study of the distribution of cases due to COVID-19 for its inclusion in the interventions and measures implemented to contain contagions and reduce impacts on the most vulnerable populations.

AB  - The outbreak and spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to an unprecedented wealth of literature on the impact of human coronaviruses on pregnancy. The number of case studies and publications alone are several orders of magnitude larger than those published in all previous human coronavirus outbreaks combined, enabling robust conclusions to be drawn from observations for the first time. However, the importance of learning from previous human coronavirus outbreaks cannot be understated. In this narrative review, we describe what we consider to the major learning points arising from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in relation to pregnancy, and where these confound what might have been expected from previous coronavirus outbreaks.

AB  - How will the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic develop in the coming months and years? Based on an expert survey, we examine key aspects that are likely to influence the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. The challenges and developments will strongly depend on the progress of national and global vaccination programs, the emergence and spread of variants of concern (VOCs), and public responses to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). In the short term, many people remain unvaccinated, VOCs continue to emerge and spread, and mobility and population mixing are expected to increase. Therefore, lifting restrictions too much and too early risk another damaging wave. This challenge remains despite the reduced opportunities for transmission given vaccination progress and reduced indoor mixing in summer 2021. In autumn 2021, increased indoor activity might accelerate the spread again, whilst a necessary reintroduction of NPIs might be too slow. The incidence may strongly rise again, possibly filling intensive care units, if vaccination levels are not high enough. A moderate, adaptive level of NPIs will thus remain necessary. These epidemiological aspects combined with economic, social, and health-related consequences provide a more holistic perspective on the future of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - We aimed to determine absolute and relative risks of either symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection for late cardiovascular (CV) events and all-cause mortality. We conducted a retrospective double cohort study of patients with either symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19+ cohort) and its documented absence (COVID-19− cohort). The study investigators drew a simple random sample of records from all patients under the Oregon Health & Science University Healthcare (n = 65,585), with available COVID-19 test results, performed March 1, 2020 to September 13, 2020. Exclusion criteria were age <18 years and no established Oregon Health & Science University care. The primary outcome was a composite of CV morbidity and mortality. All-cause mortality was the secondary outcome. The study population included 1,355 patients (mean age 48.7 ± 20.5 years; 770 women [57%], 977 White non-Hispanic [72%]; 1,072 ensured [79%]; 563 with CV disease history [42%]). During a median 6 months at risk, the primary composite outcome was observed in 38 of 319 patients who were COVID-19+ (12%) and 65 of 1,036 patients who were COVID-19− (6%). In the Cox regression, adjusted for demographics, health insurance, and reason for COVID-19 testing, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with the risk for primary composite outcome (hazard ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 2.78, p = 0.029). Inverse probability-weighted estimation, conditioned for 31 covariates, showed that for every patient who was COVID-19+, the average time to all-cause death was 65.5 days less than when all these patients were COVID-19−: average treatment effect on the treated −65.5 (95% confidence interval −125.4 to −5.61) days, p = 0.032. In conclusion, either symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with an increased risk for late CV outcomes and has a causal effect on all-cause mortality in a late post-COVID-19 period.

AB  - This paper describes one of the first attempts to gauge the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global trajectory of real GDP over the course of 2020 and 2021. It is also among the first efforts to distinguish between the role of domestic variables and global trade in transmitting the economic effects of COVID-19. We estimate panel data regressions of the quarterly growth in real GDP on pandemic variables for 90 countries over the period 2020 Q1 through 2021 Q4. We find that readings on the number of COVID-19 deaths had a very small effect in our aggregate sample. On the other hand, changes in the stringency of the lockdown measures taken by governments to restrict the spread of the virus were an important influence on GDP. The economic effects of the pandemic differed between rich and poor countries: COVID-19 deaths exerted a somewhat greater drag on GDP in advanced economies, although this difference was not statistically significant, whereas lockdown restrictions were more injurious to economic activity in emerging and developing economies. In addition to these domestic pandemic effects, global trade represented a significant channel through which the economic effects of the pandemic spilled across national borders. This finding underscores how globalization makes each country vulnerable not only to medical contagion from the COVID-19 pandemic, but to economic contagion as well.

AB  - To monitor the COVID-19 epidemic in Cuba, data on several epidemiological indicators have been collected on a daily basis for each municipality. Studying the spatio-temporal dynamics in these indicators, and how they behave similarly, can help us better understand how COVID-19 spread across Cuba. Therefore, spatio-temporal models can be used to analyze these indicators. Univariate spatio-temporal models have been thoroughly studied, but when interest lies in studying the association between multiple outcomes, a joint model that allows for association between the spatial and temporal patterns is necessary. The purpose of our study was to develop a multivariate spatio-temporal model to study the association between the weekly number of COVID-19 deaths and the weekly number of imported COVID-19 cases in Cuba during 2021. To allow for correlation between the spatial patterns, a multivariate conditional autoregressive prior (MCAR) was used. Correlation between the temporal patterns was taken into account by using two approaches; either a multivariate random walk prior was used or a multivariate conditional autoregressive prior (MCAR) was used. All models were fitted within a Bayesian framework.

AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has generated enormous morbidity and mortality, as well as large health system disruptions including changes in use of prescription medications, outpatient encounters, emergency department admissions, and hospitalizations. These pandemic-related disruptions are reflected in real-world data derived from electronic medical records, administrative claims, disease or medication registries, and mobile devices. We discuss how pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare utilization may impact the conduct of noninterventional studies designed to characterize the utilization and estimate the effects of medical interventions on health-related outcomes. Using hypothetical studies, we highlight consequences that the pandemic may have on study design elements including participant selection and ascertainment of exposures, outcomes, and covariates. We discuss the implications of these pandemic-related disruptions on possible threats to external validity (participant selection) and internal validity (for example, confounding, selection bias, missing data bias). These concerns may be amplified in populations disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, such as racial/ethnic minorities, rural residents, or people experiencing poverty. We propose a general framework for researchers to carefully consider during the design and analysis of noninterventional studies that use real-world data from the COVID-19 era.

The relative scarcity of paediatric COVID-19 disease infers protection from its direct harms. We aim to highlight the potentially severe indirect effects of COVID-19 upon global childhood pneumonia.
Study design
This is a discussion piece written from the authors’ perspective.
Methods
We use the social determinants of health to describe the indirect impact of COVID-19 upon global childhood pneumonia.
Results
The social determinants of health are a range of social, economic, and environmental factors used to explore and explain global health differences and inequalities. Global childhood pneumonia is a significant public health problem with clear linkage to the social determinants of health. COVID-19 is a significant threat to the health and wellbeing of children around the world through its potentially severe effects on all strata of the social determinants of health.
Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic could undermine years of progress in reducing both global childhood pneumonia incidence and mortality, and most significantly affect vulnerable children living in poverty.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for COVID-19 disease, proved to cause the activation of the innate and adaptive immune system in a small percentage of patients, which resulted in immune dysregulation with massive inflammatory responses and cytokines release. At the same time, complex interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and immune system led to a higher evidence of COVID-19 related autoimmune diseases. In this chapter, we analyze the probable mechanisms of action of high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We reported evidence in which IVIg proved to be useful in severe COVID-19 disease and in the management of immune dysregulation. Similarly, the use of IVIg was important in the treatment of autoimmune diseases related to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. We also discuss the use of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 disease.

AB  - Background and aims
High levels of lipoprotein(a) could worsen the outcome of COVID-19 due to prothrombotic and proinflammatory properties of lipoprotein(a). We tested the hypotheses that during COVID-19 hospitalization i) increased thrombotic activity and inflammation are associated with lipoprotein(a) levels, and ii) lipoprotein(a) levels are associated with rate of hospital death and discharge.
Methods
We studied 211 patients admitted to Copenhagen University Hospital in 2020 with COVID-19, that is, prior to any vaccination. Thrombotic activity was marked by elevated D-dimer while inflammation was marked by elevated interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin. Patients were followed until death (N = 36) or discharge (N = 175).
Results
A 2-fold higher D-dimer was associated with 14% (95%CI: 8.1–20%) higher lipoprotein(a). Conversely, 2-fold higher interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with respectively 4.3% (0.62–7.8%), 5.7% (0.15–5.2%), and 8.7% (5.2–12%) lower lipoprotein(a). For hospital death, the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio per 2-fold higher lipoprotein(a) was 1.26 (95%CI:0.91–1.73). Corresponding hazard ratios per 2-fold higher biomarker were 0.93 (0.75–1.16) for D-dimer, 1.42 (1.17–1.73) for interleukin-6, 1.44 (0.95–2.17) for C-reactive protein, and 1.44 (1.20–1.73) for procalcitonin. For hospital discharge, the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio per 2-fold higher lipoprotein(a) was 0.91 (95%CI:0.79–1.06). Corresponding hazard ratios per 2-fold higher biomarker were 0.86 (0.75–0.98) for D-dimer, 0.84 (0.76–0.92) for interleukin-6, 0.80 (0.71–0.90) for C-reactive protein, and 0.76 (0.67–0.88) for procalcitonin.
Conclusions
In COVID-19 patients, thrombotic activity marked by elevated D-dimer was associated with higher lipoprotein(a) while elevated inflammatory biomarkers of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with lower lipoprotein(a); however, elevated lipoprotein(a) was not associated with rate of hospital death or discharge.

AB  - Background
Elderly patients represent a high-risk group with increased risk of death from COVID-19. Despite the number of published studies, several unmet needs in care for older adults exist.
Objectives
To discuss unmet needs of COVID-19 in this special population.
Sources
A literature review for studies on COVID-19 in elderly patients published between December 2019 and November 2021 was performed. Clinical questions were formulated to guide the literature search. The search was conducted in the MEDLINE database, combining specific search terms. Two reviewers independently conducted the search and selected the studies according to the prespecified clinical questions.
Content
Elderly patients with COVID-19 have peculiar characteristics. They may have atypical clinical presentation, with no fever and with delirium or neurological manifestations as the most common signs, with potential delayed diagnosis and increased risk of death. The reported fatality rates among elderly patients with COVID-19 are extremely high. Several factors, including comorbidities, atypical presentation, and exclusion from intensive care unit care, contribute to this excess of mortality. Age alone is frequently used as a key factor to exclude the elderly from intensive care, but there is evidence that frailty rather than age better predicts the risk of poor outcome in this category. Durability of vaccine efficacy in the elderly remains debated, and the need for a third booster dose is becoming increasingly evident. Finally, efforts to care for elderly patients who have survived after acute COVID-19 should be implemented, considering the high rates of long COVID sequelae and the risk of longitudinal functional and cognitive decline.
Implications
We highlight peculiar aspects of COVID-19 in elderly patients and factors contributing to high risk of poor outcome in this category. We also illuminated gaps in current evidence, suggesting future research directions and underlining the need for further studies on the optimal management of elderly patients with COVID-19.

AB  - The appearance of the coronavirus, SARs COV 2 in late 2019 signaled the start of a global pandemic. In response, multiple new vaccines were introduced in record time. As always, most of the population rushed to get vaccinated. However, in the United States and some other countries, a sizable minority refused vaccination, even when mandated. This refusal was a result of multiple forces acting at that time. Political polarization stimulated those who considered any government regulation an infringement on their liberties. Many politicians supported this. Mistrust of science and the medical establishment compounded the issue. It was claimed that the vaccines were rushed to market without adequate testing. Finally, disinformation coming from right-wing groups, media outlets, and foreign sources exaggerated the risks of vaccination while downplaying its effectiveness.

AB  - Summary
In April, 2020, just months into the COVID-19 pandemic, an international group of public health researchers published three lessons learned from the HIV pandemic for the response to COVID-19, which were to: anticipate health inequalities, create an enabling environment to support behavioural change, and engage a multidisciplinary effort. We revisit these lessons in light of more than 2 years’ experience with the COVID-19 pandemic. With specific examples, we detail how inequalities have played out within and between countries, highlight factors that support or impede the creation of enabling environments, and note ongoing issues with the scarcity of integrated science and health system approaches. We argue that to better apply lessons learned as the COVID-19 pandemic matures and other infectious disease outbreaks emerge, it will be imperative to create dialogue among polarised perspectives, identify shared priorities, and draw on multidisciplinary evidence.

AB  - Background
Prior studies of COVID-19 cardiovascular sequelae include diagnoses made within 4 weeks, but the World Health Organization definition for “postacute phase” is >3 months.
Objectives
The purpose of this study was to determine which cardiovascular diagnoses in the postacute phase of COVID-19 are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods
Retrospective cohort study of all adults in Alberta who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021, matched (by age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity score, and test date) with controls who had a negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test.
Results
The 177,892 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (mean age 42.7 years, 49.7% female) were more likely to visit an emergency department (5.7% vs 3.3%), be hospitalized (3.4% vs 2.1%), or die (1.3% vs 0.4%) within 1 month than matched test-negative controls. After 3 months, cases were significantly more likely than controls to have an emergency department visit or hospitalization for diabetes mellitus (1.5% vs 0.7%), hypertension (0.6% vs 0.4%), heart failure (0.2% vs 0.1%), or kidney injury (0.3% vs 0.2%). In the 6,030 patients who had survived a hospitalization for COVID-19, postacute phase risks were substantially greater for diabetes mellitus (9.5% vs 3.0%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.16 [95% CI: 2.43-4.12]), hypertension (3.5% vs 1.4%, aOR: 2.89 [95% CI: 1.97-4.23]), heart failure (2.1% vs 0.7%, aOR: 3.16 [95% CI: 1.88-5.29]), kidney injury (3.1% vs 0.8%, aOR: 2.70 [95% CI: 1.71-4.28]), bleeding (1.5% vs 0.5%, aOR: 3.40 [95% CI: 1.83-6.32]), and venous thromboembolism (0.8% vs 0.3%, aOR: 3.60 [95% CI: 1.59-8.13]).
Conclusions
Clinicians should screen COVID-19 survivors for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, and kidney dysfunction in the postacute phase.

AB  - The association between COVID-19 and subsequent neurological and psychiatric disorders is well established. However, two important questions remain unanswered. First, what are the risks in those admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19? Admission to ICU is itself associated with neurological and psychiatric sequelae and it is not clear whether COVID-19 further increases those risks or changes their profile. Second, what are the trajectories of neurological and psychiatric risks in patients admitted to hospital or ICU with COVID-19, and when do the risks subside? We sought to answer these two questions using a retrospective cohort study based on electronic health records (EHR) data from the TriNetX Analytics Network (covering 89 million patients, mostly in the USA). Cohorts of patients admitted to hospital or ICU with COVID-19 were propensity score-matched (for 82 covariates capturing risk factors for COVID-19 and more severe COVID-19 illness) to patients admitted to hospital or ICU (respectively) for any other reason. Matched cohorts were followed for up to two years and the risk of 14 neurological and psychiatric outcomes were compared. A total of 280,173 patients admitted to hospital and 46,573 patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19 were successfully matched to an equal number of patients admitted to hospital or ICU for any other reason. Those hospitalised with COVID-19 were found to be at a greater risk of a range of neurological and psychiatric outcomes including seizure/epilepsy, encephalitis, myoneural junction/muscle disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), dementia, cognitive deficits, psychotic disorder, mood and anxiety disorders, but not ischaemic stroke or intracranial haemorrhage. When risks were elevated after COVID-19, most remained so for the whole two years of follow-up (except for mood and anxiety disorders). Risk profiles and trajectories were substantially different among those admitted to ICU: compared to those admitted for any other reasons, those admitted with COVID-19 were at a greater risk of myoneural junction/muscle disease, GBS, cognitive deficits and anxiety disorder, but at a significantly lower risk of ischaemic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, encephalitis, and mood disorder. When elevated, the risks in those admitted to ICU with COVID-19 were mostly short-lived. In summary, risks of neurological and psychiatric sequelae in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 are wide ranging and long standing whereas those in patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19 are similar to, or lower than, the risks observed post-ICU admission for any other cause. These contrasting risk trajectories are relevant for researchers, clinicians, patients, and policymakers.

AB  - Background
Immunothrombosis, a process of inflammation and coagulation, is involved in sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome formation (ARDS). However, the clinical correlation between immunothrombosis biomarkers (including tissue factor [TF] and von Willebrand factor [vWF]) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related ARDS is unknown. This study investigated ARDS development following moderate-to-critical COVID-19 and examined immunothrombosis biomarkers as ARDS predictors.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study included patients with moderate-to-critical COVID-19 (n = 165) admitted to a northern teaching hospital during the 2021 pandemic in Taiwan, who had no COVID-19 vaccinations. Immunothrombosis biomarkers were compared between COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS (no-ARDS) and a control group consisting of 100 healthy individuals.
Results
The study included 58 ARDS and 107 no-ARDS patients. In multivariable analysis, TF (aOR=1.031, 95% CI: 1.009–1.053, p = 0.006); and vWF (aOR=1.053, 95% CI: 1.002–1.105, p = 0.041) were significantly associated with ARDS episodes, after adjusting for other confounding factors. vWF and TF predicted ARDS with the area under the curve of 0.870 (95% CI: 0.796–0.945). Further mechanical ventilation analysis found TF to be correlated significantly with pCO2 and ventilatory ratio.
Conclusions
TF and vWF levels potentially predicted ARDS development within 7 days of admission for COVID-19 after adjusting for traditional risk factors. TF correlated with ventilation impairment in COVID-19 ARDS but further prospective studies are needed.

AB  - Background
Available national public data are often too incomplete and noisy to be used directly to interpret the evolution of epidemics over time, which is essential for making timely and appropriate decisions. The use of compartment models can be a worthwhile and attractive approach to address this problem. The present study proposes a model compartmentalized by sex and age groups that allows for more complete information on the evolution of the CoViD-19 pandemic in Italy.
Material and methods
Italian public data on CoViD-19 were pre-treated with a 7-day moving average filter to reduce noise. A time-varying susceptible-infected-recovered-deceased (SIRD) model distributed by age and sex groups was then proposed. Recovered and infected individuals distributed by groups were reconstructed through the SIRD model, which was also used to simulate and identify optimal scenarios of pandemic containment by vaccination. The simulation started from realistic initial conditions based on the SIRD model parameters, estimated from filtered and reconstructed Italian data, at different pandemic times and phases. The following three objective functions, accounting for total infections, total deaths, and total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, were minimized by optimizing the percentages of vaccinated individuals in five different age groups.
Results
The developed SIRD model clearly highlighted those pandemic phases in which younger people, who had more contacts and lower mortality, infected older people, characterized by a significantly higher mortality, especially in males. Optimizing vaccination strategies yielded different results depending on the cost function used. As expected, to reduce total deaths, the suggested strategy was to vaccinate the older age groups, whatever the baseline scenario. In contrast, for QALYs lost and total infections, the optimal vaccine solutions strongly depended on the initial pandemic conditions: during phases of high virus diffusion, the model suggested to vaccinate mainly younger groups with a higher contact rate.
Conclusion
Because of the poor quality and insufficient availability of stratified public pandemic data, ad hoc information filtering and reconstruction procedures proved essential. The time-varying SIRD model, stratified by age and sex groups, provided insights and additional information on the dynamics of CoViD-19 infection in Italy, also supporting decision making for containment strategies such as vaccination.

AB  - Summary
Background
People with learning disabilities are at substantially increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, but evidence on risks of COVID-19 mortality for disabled people more generally is limited. We aimed to use population-level data to estimate the association between self-reported disability and death involving COVID-19 during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in England.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study of adults aged 30–100 years living in private households or communal establishments in England, using data from the Office for National Statistics Public Health Data Asset. Participants were present at the 2011 Census and alive on Jan 24, 2020. Participants reported being limited a lot in their daily activities, limited a little, or not limited at all, in response to a question from the 2011 Census. The outcome was death involving COVID-19, occurring between Jan 24, 2020, and Feb 28, 2021. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between disability and death involving COVID-19, sequentially adjusting for age, residence type (private household, care home, or other communal establishment), geographical characteristics (local authority district and population density), sociodemographic characteristics (ethnicity, highest qualification, Index of Multiple Deprivation decile, household characteristics [National Statistics Socio-economic Classification of the household reference person, tenure of household, household size, family status, household composition, and key worker in household], key worker type, individual and household exposure to disease, and individual and household proximity to others), and health status (pre-existing health conditions, body-mass index, and number of admissions to hospital and days spent in hospital over the previous 3 years).
Findings
29 293 845 adults were included in the study (13 806 623 [47%] men, 15 487 222 [53%] women), of whom 3 038 772 (10%) reported being limited a little and 2 011 576 (7%) reported being limited a lot. During follow-up, 105 213 people died from causes involving COVID-19 in England, 61 416 (58%) of whom were disabled. Age-adjusted analyses showed higher mortality involving COVID-19 among disabled people who were limited a lot (HR 3·05 [95% CI 2·98–3·11] for men; 3·48 [3·41–3·56] for women) and disabled people who were limited a little (HR 1·88 [1·84–1·92] for men; 2·03 [1·98–2·08] for women) than among non-disabled people. Adjustment for residence type, geography, sociodemographics, and health conditions reduced but did not eliminate the associations between disability and death involving COVID-19 (HR 1·35 [1·32–1·38] for men who were limited a lot; 1·21 [1·18–1·23] for men who were limited a little; 1·55 [1·51–1·59] for women who were limited a lot; and 1·28 [1·25–1·31] for women who were limited a little).
Interpretation
Given the association between disability and mortality involving COVID-19, verification of these findings and consideration of recommendations for protective measures are now required.
Funding
None.

AB  - The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shocked world health authorities generating a global health crisis. The present study aimed to analyze the different factors associated with physical activity that could have an impact in the COVID-19, providing a practical recommendation based on actual scientific knowledge. We conducted a consensus critical review using primary sources, scientific articles, and secondary bibliographic indexes, databases, and web pages. The method was a narrative literature review of the available literature regarding physical activity and physical activity related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main online database used in the present research were PubMed, SciELO, and Google Scholar. COVID-19 has negatively influenced motor behavior, levels of regular exercise practice, eating and nutritional patterns, and the psychological status of citizens. These factors feed into each other, worsening COVID-19 symptoms, the risk of death from SARS-CoV-2, and the symptoms and effectiveness of the vaccine. The characteristics and symptoms related with the actual COVID-19 pandemic made the physical activity interventions a valuable prevention and treatment factor. Physical activity improves body composition, the cardiorespiratory, metabolic, and mental health of patients and enhancing antibody responses in vaccination.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus was identified in China in 2019 as the causative agent of COVID-19, and quickly spread throughout the world, causing over 7 million deaths, of which 2 million occurred prior to the introduction of the first vaccine. In the following discussion, while recognising that complement is just one of many players in COVID-19, we focus on the relationship between complement and COVID-19 disease, with limited digression into directly-related areas such as the relationship between complement, kinin release, and coagulation. Prior to the 2019 COVID-19 outbreak, an important role for complement in coronavirus diseases had been established. Subsequently, multiple investigations of patients with COVID-19 confirmed that complement dysregulation is likely to be a major driver of disease pathology, in some, if not all, patients. These data fuelled evaluation of many complement-directed therapeutic agents in small patient cohorts, with claims of significant beneficial effect. As yet, these early results have not been reflected in larger clinical trials, posing questions such as who to treat, appropriate time to treat, duration of treatment, and optimal target for treatment. While significant control of the pandemic has been achieved through a global scientific and medical effort to comprehend the etiology of the disease, through extensive SARS-CoV-2 testing and quarantine measures, through vaccine development, and through improved therapy, possibly aided by attenuation of the dominant strains, it is not yet over. In this review, we summarise complement-relevant literature, emphasise its main conclusions, and formulate a hypothesis for complement involvement in COVID-19. Based on this we make suggestions as to how any future outbreak might be better managed in order to minimise impact on patients.

AB  - Background
The viability and virulence of COVID-19 are complex in nature. Although the relationship between environmental parameters and COVID-19 is well studied across the globe, in India, such studies are limited. This research aims to explore long-term exposure to weather conditions and the role of air pollution on the infection spread and mortality due to COVID-19 in India.
Method
District-level COVID-19 data from April 26, 2020 to July 10, 2021 was used for the study. Environmental determinants such as land surface temperature, relative humidity (RH), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) were considered for analysis. The bivariate spatial association was used to explore the spatial relationship between Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and these environmental factors. Further, the Bayesian multivariate linear regression model was applied to observe the association between environmental factors and the CFR of COVID-19.
Results
Spatial shifting of COVID-19 cases from Western to Southern and then Eastern parts of India were well observed. The infection rate was highly concentrated in most of the Western and Southern regions of India, while the CFR shows more concentration in Northern India along with Maharashtra. Four main spatial clusters of infection were recognized during the study period. The time-series analysis indicates significantly more CFR with higher AOD, O3, and NO2 in India.
Conclusions
COVID-19 is highly associated with environmental parameters and air pollution in India. The study provides evidence to warrant consideration of environmental parameters in health models to mediate potential solutions. Cleaner air is a must to mitigate COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected certain groups, such as older people (ie, >65 years), minority ethnic populations, and people with specific chronic conditions including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and some respiratory diseases. There is now evidence of not only direct but also indirect adverse effects of COVID-19 in people with diabetes. Recurrent lockdowns and public health measures throughout the pandemic have restricted access to routine diabetes care, limiting new diagnoses, and affecting self-management, routine follow-ups, and access to medications, as well as affecting lifestyle behaviours and emotional wellbeing globally. Pre-pandemic studies have shown that short-term delays in delivery of routine care, even by 12 months, are associated with adverse effects on risk factor control and worse microvascular, macrovascular, and mortality outcomes in people with diabetes. Disruptions within the short-to-medium term due to natural disasters also result in worse diabetes outcomes. However, the true magnitude of the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term outcomes and mortality in people with diabetes is still unclear. Disasters tend to exacerbate existing health disparities; as we recover ambulatory diabetes services in the aftermath of the pandemic, there is an opportunity to prioritise those with the greatest need, and to target resources and interventions aimed at improving outcomes and reducing inequality.

AB  - COVID-19 has had a calamitous effect on the global community. Despite intense study, the immunologic response to the infection is only partially understood. In addition to older age and ethnicity, patients with comorbidities including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, malignancy, renal, and pulmonary disease may experience severe outcomes. Some patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) and secondary immunodeficiency also appear to be at increased risk from COVID-19. In addition to vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2, patients with PIDs often have chronic pulmonary disease and may not respond to vaccines, which exacerbates their long-term risk. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders, the most frequent symptomatic PID in adults and children, have a spectrum of B- and T-cell defects. It may be possible to stratify their risk for severe COVID-19 based on age, ethnicity, the severity of the T-cell defect, and the presence of other comorbidities. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders and other immunodeficiencies are at risk for Chronic COVID-19, a dangerous stalemate between a suboptimal immune response and SARS-CoV-2. Intra-host viral evolution could result in the rapid emergence of vaccine-resistant mutants and variants of high consequence; it is a public health emergency. Vaccination and prevention of Chronic COVID-19 in immunodeficient patients is therefore of the utmost priority. Having a reliable diagnostic assay for T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for evaluating responses to vaccines in these patients. New treatments for SARS-CoV-2 such as NZACE2-Pātari are likely to be particularly beneficial for immunodeficient patients, especially those who fail to mount a robust T-cell response to COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - Background
Studies have reported evidence about the effectiveness of a third dose with BNT162b2 for preventing hospitalization and death by COVID-19. However, there is little evidence regarding other primary vaccine schedules such as BBIBP-CorV and ChAdOx1-S. We estimated the relative vaccine effectiveness (RVE) of the booster dose versus the primary regimens of COVID-19 vaccines based on BBIBP-CorV, ChAdOx1-S, or BNT162b2 for preventing death during the Omicron wave in Peruvian adult people.
Methods
We carried out a nested case-control study with a risk set sampling of controls using data from Peru between December 20, 2021, and February 20, 2022 (during the Omicron wave). Data on vaccination, COVID-19 tests and deaths were collected from national surveillance databases. We performed conditional logistic regression models to estimate the RVE on the adult population. In addition, we executed sub-group analysis per age group (18 to 59 years, and 60 years or more) and per primary regime (based on BNT162b2, BBIBP-CorV, or ChAdOx1-S).
Results
Of the 11,188,332 people eligible to enter the study 1,974 met the case definition (death from COVID-19) and were matched to 9,183 controls. The overall RVE of a third dose to prevent death was 87.2% (84.2%-89.7%), which varied according to the primary regime (87.3% for BNT162b2, 82.0% for BBIPB-CorV-2, and 79.5% for ChAdOx-S). In older adults, the RVE was 87.1%, without significant variations according to the primary regime (86.1% for BNT162b2, 86.1 for BBIBP-CorV, and 82% for ChAdOx-S).
Conclusions
The booster) dose of vaccine against COVID-19 had a high RVE for preventing death by COVID-19 in the Peruvian population in all primary regimes of vaccines during the Omicron wave. This effect was consistent in people over 60 years of age, the group most vulnerable to die from this infection.

AB  - Objectives
SARS-CoV-2 transmission in sub-Saharan Africa has probably been underestimated. Population-based seroprevalence studies are needed to determine the extent of transmission in the continent.
Methods
Blood samples from a cohort of Gambian pregnant women were tested for SARS-CoV-2 total receptor binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin (Ig) M/IgG before (Pre-pandemic: October-December 2019) and during the pandemic (Pre-wave 1: February-June 2020; Post-wave 1: October-December 2020, Post-wave 2: May-June 2021; and Post-wave 3: October-December 2021). Samples reactive for SARS-CoV-2 total RBD IgM/IgG were tested in specific S1- and nucleocapsid (NCP) IgG assays.
Results
SARS-CoV-2 total RBD IgM/IgG seroprevalence was 0.9% 95% confidence interval (0.2, 4.9) in Pre-pandemic; 4.1% (1.4, 11.4) in Pre-wave 1; 31.1% (25.2, 37.7) in Post-wave 1; 62.5% (55.8, 68.8) in Post-wave 2 and 90.0% (85.1, 93.5) in Post-wave 3. S-protein IgG and NCP-protein IgG seroprevalence also increased at each Post-wave period. Although S-protein IgG and NCP-protein IgG seroprevalence was similar at Post-wave 1, S-protein IgG seroprevalence was higher at Post-wave 2 and Post-wave 3, (prevalence difference 13.5 [0.1, 26.8] and prevalence ratio 1.5 [1.0, 2.3] in Post-wave 2; and 22.9 [9.2, 36.6] and 1.4 [1.1, 1.8] in Post-wave 3 respectively, P <0.001).
Conclusion
SARS-CoV-2 transmission in The Gambia during the first 3 COVID-19 waves was high, differing significantly from official numbers of COVID-19 cases reported. Our findings are important for policy makers in managing the near-endemic COVID-19.

AB  - Background
Pulmonary embolism is a known complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Epidemiological population data focusing on pulmonary embolism-related mortality is limited.
Methods
Veneto is a region in Northern Italy counting 4,879,133 inhabitants in 2020. All ICD-10 codes from death certificates (1st January 2018 to 31st December 2020) were examined. Comparisons were made between 2020 (COVID-19 outbreak) and the average of the two-year period 2018–2019. All-cause, COVID-19-related and the following cardiovascular deaths have been studied: pulmonary embolism, hypertensive disease, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and cerebrovascular diseases.
Results
In 2020, a total of 56,412 deaths were recorded, corresponding to a 16% (n = 7806) increase compared to the period 2018–2019. The relative percentage increase during the so-called first and second waves was 19% and 44%, respectively. Of 7806 excess deaths, COVID-19 codes were reported in 90% of death certificates. The percentage increase in pulmonary embolism-related deaths was 27% (95%CI 19–35%), 1018 deaths during the year 2020, compared to 804 mean annual deaths in the period 2018–2019. This was more evident among men, who experience an absolute increase of 147 deaths (+45%), than in women (+67 deaths; +14%). The increase was primarily driven by deaths recorded during the second wave (+91% in October–December). An excess of deaths, particularly among men and during the second wave, was also observed for other cardiovascular diseases, notably hypertensive disease, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, and ischemic heart disease.
Conclusions
We observed a considerable increase of all-cause mortality during the year 2020. This was mainly driven by COVID-19 and its complications. The relative increase in the number of pulmonary embolism-related deaths was more prominent during the second wave, suggesting a possible underdiagnosis during the first wave.

AB  - Summary
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted health systems globally. We estimated the effect of the pandemic on the coverage and timeliness of routine childhood immunization in India through April 2021.
Methods
We used data from India's National Family Health Survey 2019–2021 (NFHS-5), a cross-sectional survey which collected immunization information of under-five children from a nationally representative sample of households between June 2019 and April 2021. We used a mother fixed-effects regression model – accounting for secular trends and confounding factors – to compare COVID-affected children with their COVID-unaffected siblings (n = 59,144). Children who were eligible for a vaccine after January 30, 2020 (date of the first COVID case in India) were considered as the COVID-affected group and those eligible for a vaccine before this date were included in the COVID-unaffected group. Coverage of the following vaccine doses was considered—Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), hepatitis B birth dose (hepB0), DPT1 (diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, first dose), DPT2, DPT3, polio1, polio2, polio3, and measles first dose (MCV1). Indicators of vaccine coverage and vaccine timeliness (defined as receiving a dose within 45 days of minimum eligibility age) were separately examined.
Findings
Immunization coverage was lower in COVID-affected children as compared with unaffected children, ranging from 2% lower for BCG and hepB0 to 9% for DPT3 and 10% for polio3. There was no significant difference in MCV1 coverage. Coverage reduction was greater for vaccines doses given in later age groups. The rate of timely receipt of polio and DPT vaccine doses was 3%–5% lower among COVID-affected children relative to unaffected children. Among population subgroups, COVID-affected male children and those from rural areas experienced the highest reduction in vaccine coverage.
Interpretation
Children in India experienced lower routine immunization coverage and greater delays in immunization during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly emerged as one of the biggest public health concerns of the 21st century. Although it was initially reported as a cluster of pneumonia cases, it quickly became apparent that COVID-19 is not merely a respiratory tract infection. Its clinical course is often complicated by cardiovascular manifestations including venous and arterial thrombosis, electrical disturbances, and myocardial damage. In addition, the cardiovascular system is involved not only during infection but also preceding the contraction of the virus; having cardiovascular comorbidities indicates significant vulnerability to the pathogen. As longer-term data continue to accumulate, we now have concerns over its lasting cardiovascular effects after recovery. Moreover, there have been substantial collateral effects on the epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases. Reports of adverse cardiovascular events from vaccination have emerged as new hurdles to our efforts to bring an end to the pandemic. As such, the association between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system and cardiovascular practice in general is expansive. In this review, we provide an overview of the knowledge and considerations in this field, based on the evidence available at the time of this writing.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that began spreading globally in late 2019. While most cases of COVID-19 present with mild to moderate symptoms, COVID-19 was the third leading cause of mortality in the United States in 2020 and 2021. Though COVID-19 affects individuals of all races and ethnicities, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations are facing an inequitable burden of COVID-19 characterized by an increased risk for hospitalization and mortality. Importantly, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx adults have also faced a greater risk of non-COVID-19-related mortality (e.g., from cardiovascular disease/CVD) during the pandemic. Contributors to the racial disparities in morbidity and mortality during the pandemic are multi-factorial as we discuss in our companion article on social determinants of health. However, profound racial variation in the prevalence of CVD and metabolic diseases may serve as a key driver of worse COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related health outcomes among racial and ethnic minority groups. Within this review, we provide data emphasizing the inequitable burden of CVD and metabolic diseases among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations. We also discuss the pathophysiology of these conditions, with a focus on how aberrant physiological alterations in the context of CVD and metabolic diseases manifest to increase susceptibility to severe COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
Background
The first wave of COVID-19 in South Africa peaked in July, 2020, and a larger second wave peaked in January, 2021, in which the SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 (Beta) lineage predominated. We aimed to compare in-hospital mortality and other patient characteristics between the first and second waves.
Methods
In this prospective cohort study, we analysed data from the DATCOV national active surveillance system for COVID-19 admissions to hospital from March 5, 2020, to March 27, 2021. The system contained data from all hospitals in South Africa that have admitted a patient with COVID-19. We used incidence risk for admission to hospital and determined cutoff dates to define five wave periods: pre-wave 1, wave 1, post-wave 1, wave 2, and post-wave 2. We compared the characteristics of patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital in wave 1 and wave 2, and risk factors for in-hospital mortality accounting for wave period using random-effect multivariable logistic regression.
Findings
Peak rates of COVID-19 cases, admissions, and in-hospital deaths in the second wave exceeded rates in the first wave: COVID-19 cases, 240·4 cases per 100 000 people vs 136·0 cases per 100 000 people; admissions, 27·9 admissions per 100 000 people vs 16·1 admissions per 100 000 people; deaths, 8·3 deaths per 100 000 people vs 3·6 deaths per 100 000 people. The weekly average growth rate in hospital admissions was 20% in wave 1 and 43% in wave 2 (ratio of growth rate in wave 2 compared with wave 1 was 1·19, 95% CI 1·18–1·20). Compared with the first wave, individuals admitted to hospital in the second wave were more likely to be age 40–64 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·22, 95% CI 1·14–1·31), and older than 65 years (aOR 1·38, 1·25–1·52), compared with younger than 40 years; of Mixed race (aOR 1·21, 1·06–1·38) compared with White race; and admitted in the public sector (aOR 1·65, 1·41–1·92); and less likely to be Black (aOR 0·53, 0·47–0·60) and Indian (aOR 0·77, 0·66–0·91), compared with White; and have a comorbid condition (aOR 0·60, 0·55–0·67). For multivariable analysis, after adjusting for weekly COVID-19 hospital admissions, there was a 31% increased risk of in-hospital mortality in the second wave (aOR 1·31, 95% CI 1·28–1·35). In-hospital case-fatality risk increased from 17·7% in weeks of low admission (<3500 admissions) to 26·9% in weeks of very high admission (>8000 admissions; aOR 1·24, 1·17–1·32).
Interpretation
In South Africa, the second wave was associated with higher incidence of COVID-19, more rapid increase in admissions to hospital, and increased in-hospital mortality. Although some of the increased mortality can be explained by admissions in the second wave being more likely in older individuals, in the public sector, and by the increased health system pressure, a residual increase in mortality of patients admitted to hospital could be related to the new Beta lineage.
Funding
DATCOV as a national surveillance system is funded by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and the South African National Government.

AB  - Purpose
Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) are considered particularly susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV2 on the basis of the immunodeficiency associated with advanced age, comorbidity burden, medication use, and need for frequent visits to dialysis clinics. In prior studies, thymalfasin (thymosin alpha 1, Ta1) has been shown to enhance antibody response to influenza vaccine and reduce influenza infection in geriatric populations, including hemodialysis patients, when used as an adjunct to influenza vaccine. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic we speculated that administration of Ta1 to HD patients would result in reduced rate and severity of COVID-19 infection. We also hypothesized that HD patients treated with Ta1 who did become infected with COVID-19 would have a milder course of infection in terms of hospitalization rates, requirement for and length of ICU stays, requirement for mechanical ventilation, and survival. Further, we proposed that patients who avoided COVID-19 infection during the study would have decreased non-COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations compared to controls.
Procedures
The study launched in January 2021 and, as of July 1, 2022, 254 ESRD/ HD patients from five dialysis centers in Kansas City, MO have been screened. Of these, 194 patients have been randomized 1:1 to either Group A (1.6 mg Ta1 given subcutaneously twice weekly for 8 weeks), or Group B (control group not receiving Ta1). After the 8-week treatment period, subjects were followed for an additional 4 months and monitored for safety and efficacy. A data safely monitoring board reviewed all reported adverse effects and commented on study progress.
Results
To date, only 3 deaths have occurred in subjects treated with Ta1 (Group A), compared to 7 in the control (Group B). There have been 12 COVID-19 related serious adverse effects (SAEs; 5 in Group A, and 7 in Group B). The majority of patients have received a COVID-19 vaccine (91 patients in group A, and 76 patients in Group B) at various times throughout the study. Nearing completion of the study, blood samples have been collected and antibody responses to COVID-19 will be analyzed along with safety and efficacy endpoints when all subjects have completed the study.

AB  - This article describes the excess deaths observed when hospitals are strained by COVID-19 admissions, as defined by intensive care unit bed occupancy. Specifically, when intensive care unit bed occupancy reaches 75% of capacity, there are an estimated 12,000 additional excess deaths; when hospitals exceed 100% of their intensive care unit bed capacity, approximately 80,000 excess deaths are expected in the following 2 weeks nationally. This report suggests that all patient populations, including transplant candidates and recipients, will experience additional excess deaths when there is increased strain on hospitals due to COVID-19 surges.

AB  - The aim of this study is to provide basic information that contributes to vaccine inoculation policy after COVID-19. We used the secondary data of the influenza vaccine inoculation behavior survey for community-dwelling adults conducted in 2011, before the COVID-19 pandemic, but after the 2009 novel influenza A (H1N1) pdm 09 pandemic. All factors such as socio-demographic characteristics, health-related behaviors, family environment, physical and social environment, and area of residence were adjusted, and factors related to vaccine inoculation behavior were analyzed. Those living with pregnant women had a significantly higher odds ratio of inoculation; this was self-evident in that those people considered infection to their family. Regarding the social environment, those aged 20–64 years with a significantly higher adjusted odds ratio of inoculation were those with “at least five people with which they interacted in the neighborhood”. This result can be interpreted in two ways relating to altruism in Japan. Finally, we indicated the importance of learning from the past, including the case of 2009.

AB  - Background
Multiple prediction models were developed for critical outcomes of COVID-19. However, prediction models using predictors which can be easily obtained in clinical practice and on dental status are scarce.
Aim
The study aimed to develop and externally validate prediction models for critical outcomes of COVID-19 for unvaccinated adult patients in hospital settings based on demographics, medical conditions, and dental status.
Methods
A total of 285 and 352 patients from two hospitals in the Netherlands were retrospectively included as derivation and validation cohorts. Demographics, medical conditions, and dental status were considered potential predictors. The critical outcomes (death and ICU admission) were considered endpoints. Logistic regression analyses were used to develop two models: for death alone and for critical outcomes. The performance and clinical values of the models were determined in both cohorts.
Results
Age, number of teeth, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases were the significant independent predictors. The models showed good to excellent calibration with observed: expected (O:E) ratios of 0.98 (95%CI: 0.76 to 1.25) and 1.00 (95%CI: 0.80 to 1.24), and discrimination with shrunken area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.85 and 0.79, based on the derivation cohort. In the validation cohort, the models showed good to excellent discrimination with AUC values of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.80 to 0.90) and 0.78 (95%CI: 0.73 to 0.83), but an overestimation in calibration with O:E ratios of 0.65 (95%CI: 0.49 to 0.85) and 0.67 (95%CI: 0.52 to 0.84).
Conclusion
The performance of the models was acceptable in both derivation and validation cohorts. Number of teeth was an additive important predictor of critical outcomes of COVID-19. It is an easy-to-apply tool in hospitals for risk stratification of COVID-19 prognosis.

AB  - Introduction
: The impact of vaccination and casirivimab-imdevimab monoclonal antibody treatment on the clinical outcome of COVID-19 during a period of SARS-CoV-2 Delta surge is not known.
Aim and Methods
: All patients with COVID-19 at our facilities in the US Midwest were enrolled to assess breakthrough cases among vaccinated individuals and to compare the rates of hospitalization between casirivimab-imdevimab treated versus untreated patients. The study period occurred in July 2021 during a period dominated by the Delta variant.
Results
: The majority (68.1%) of 630 COVID-19 cases occurred in unvaccinated individuals. Among 403 patients eligible for monoclonal antibody treatment, the 28-day hospitalization rate was 2.6% of 112 patients who received treatment with casirivimab-imdevimab, compared to 16.6% of 291 eligible high-risk patients who did not receive casirivimab-imdevimab (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.138, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.0426–0.4477, p = 0.001). Casirivimab-imdevimab treatment was associated with lower rates of hospitalization among the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts.
Conclusions
: During a SARS-CoV-2 Delta surge, breakthrough COVID-19 occurred among vaccinated persons, especially among those with multiple medical comorbidities. Casirivimab-imdevimab treatment was associated with significantly lower rates of hospitalization in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons.

AB  - COVID-19 has caused unprecedented disruptions to American society, yet the ramifications have exhibited a pronounced impact for racial/ethnic minority adolescents and their families. Alongside upheavals to social and learning environments, minoritized youth have navigated disproportionate health and socioeconomic challenges within their families in addition to amplified racial tensions. As a result, the pandemic has disparately impacted racial/ethnic minorities. In this review, we synthesize studies of the pandemic to describe the hardships faced by racial/ethnic minority families and adolescents, their reverberation on dimensions of well-being, and the assets which buttress their welfare in the midst of COVID-19. It is imperative that future pandemic response efforts aid the most vulnerable, particularly communities of color, to ensure equitable welfare and post-pandemic recovery.

AB  - Background
Vaccines are critical cost-effective tools to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the emergence of variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may threaten the global impact of mass vaccination campaigns.
Aims
The objective of this study was to provide an up-to-date comparative analysis of the characteristics, adverse events, efficacy, effectiveness and impact of the variants of concern for 19 COVID-19 vaccines.
Sources
References for this review were identified through searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, regulatory drug agencies and pharmaceutical companies' websites up to 22nd September 2021.
Content
Overall, all COVID-19 vaccines had a high efficacy against the original strain and the variants of concern, and were well tolerated. BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 and Sputnik V after two doses had the highest efficacy (>90%) in preventing symptomatic cases in phase III trials. mRNA vaccines, AZD1222, and CoronaVac were effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and severe infections against Alpha, Beta, Gamma or Delta variants. Regarding observational real-life data, full immunization with mRNA vaccines and AZD1222 seems to effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection against the original strain and Alpha and Beta variants but with reduced effectiveness against the Delta strain. A decline in infection protection was observed at 6 months for BNT162b2 and AZD1222. Serious adverse event rates were rare for mRNA vaccines—anaphylaxis 2.5–4.7 cases per million doses, myocarditis 3.5 cases per million doses—and were similarly rare for all other vaccines. Prices for the different vaccines varied from $2.15 to $29.75 per dose.
Implications
All vaccines appear to be safe and effective tools to prevent severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and death against all variants of concern, but the quality of evidence greatly varies depending on the vaccines considered. Questions remain regarding a booster dose and waning immunity, the duration of immunity, and heterologous vaccination. The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risks, despite rare serious adverse effects.

AB  - We study how reliable are available data on COVID-19 cases and deaths in different countries. Our analysis is based on a modification of the law of anomalous numbers, the Newcomb–Benford law, applied to the daily number of deaths and new cases in each country. We first revisit the Newcomb–Benford law and show how to avoid false negative compliance with the data. We then compare the χ2 statistics deviation from this law to a number of social and economic indices for each country by computing the Spearman rank-order correlation between them and the χ2 deviation. We considered the proportion of excess deaths for those countries with sufficient available data for a good estimate and obtained similar results: less democratic, less transparent, and more corrupt countries tend to have data of lesser quality. We also discussed the limitations of the present approach and which countries the results were significant for.

AB  - As of May 2022, there have been more than 527 million infections with severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and over 6.2 million deaths from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. COVID-19 is a multisystem illness with important neurologic consequences that impact long-term morbidity and mortality. In the acutely ill, the neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 can include distressing but relatively benign symptoms such as headache, myalgias, and anosmia; however, entities such as encephalopathy, stroke, seizures, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barre Syndrome can cause neurologic injury and resulting disability that persists long after the acute pulmonary illness. Furthermore, as many as one-third of patients may experience persistent neurologic symptoms as part of a Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Neuro-PASC) syndrome. This Neuro-PASC syndrome can affect patients who required hospitalization for COVID-19 or patients who did not require hospitalization and who may have had minor or no pulmonary symptoms. Given the large number of individuals affected and the ability of neurologic complications to impair quality of life and productivity, the neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 are likely to have major and long-lasting personal, public health, and economic consequences. While knowledge of disease mechanisms and therapies acquired prior to the pandemic can inform us on how to manage patients with the neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, there is a critical need for improved understanding of specific COVID-19 disease mechanisms and development of therapies that target the neurologic morbidities of COVID-19. This current perspective reviews evidence for proposed disease mechanisms as they inform the neurologic management of COVID-19 in adult patients while also identifying areas in need of further research.

AB  - Throughout the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, understanding the effects of COVID-19 on persons with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and Sickle Cell Trait (SCT) has garnered interest. Patients with SCD diagnosed with COVID-19 utilize the emergency department and are hospitalized at significantly higher rates compared to the general population, with vaso-occlusive crisis and acute chest syndrome as the leading presentations. Whether SCD alone increases the likelihood of severe COVID-19 illness remains uncertain; however, potential risk factors for severe disease among patients with SCD include older age, frequent acute care visits for pain, haemoglobin SC disease, and pre-existing end-organ disease. SCT status may also influence COVID-19 outcomes, particularly among those with pre-existing co-morbidities. Corticosteroids in patients with SCD and COVID-19 should be used with extreme caution given strong associations between corticosteroid exposure and severe vaso-occlusive crisis, with prophylactic transfusion administered if corticosteroids are deemed necessary. Hydroxyurea may be protective in COVID-19.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has negatively impacted on patients of the whole CKD spectrum, causing high rates of morbi-mortality. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines opened a new era, but patients with CKD (including kidney transplant, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) were systematically excluded from pivotal clinical trials. The Spanish Society of Nephrology promoted the multicentric national SENCOVAC study aimed at assessing immunological responses after vaccination in patients with CKD. During the first year after vaccination, patients with non-dialysis CKD and those on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis presented good anti-Spike antibody responses to vaccination, especially after receiving the third and fourth doses. However, kidney transplant recipients presented suboptimal responses after any vaccination schedule (initial, third and fourth dose). Especially worrisome is the situation of a patients with a persistently negative humoral response that do not seroconvert after boosters. In this regard, monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 have been approved for high-risk patients, although they may become obsolete as the viral genome evolves. The present report reviews the current status of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the CKD spectrum with emphasis on lessons learned from the SENCOVAC study. Predictors of humoral response, including vaccination schedules and types of vaccines, as well as the integration of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antiviral agents are discussed.
Resumen
Síndrome agudo respiratorio severo coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ha impactado negativamente en todos los pacientes con enfermedad renal crónica (ERC), causando elevadas tasas de morbimortalidad. La vacunación frente a SARS-CoV-2 han abierto una nueva era, aunque precisamente los pacientes con ERC (incluyendo los portadores de un injerto renal y aquellos en programas de hemodiálisis y diálisis peritoneal) han sido sistemáticamente excluidos de los ensayos clínicos. La Sociedad Española de Nefrología (S.E.N.) promovió el estudio multicéntrico SENCOVAC para evaluar la respuesta inmunológica tras la vacunación en todo el espectro de la ERC. Un año después de haber recibido la pauta inicial de vacunación, los pacientes con ERC sin necesidad de diálisis, y aquellos en hemodiálisis y diálisis peritoneal, han presenado una adecuada respuesta humoral (monitorizada con el desarrollo de anticuerpos frente a la proteína Spike), especialmente después de recibir la tercera y la cuarta dosis. Sin embargo, los portadores de un injerto renal han presentado una constante respuesta subóptima en cualquier momento de la vacunación (dosis inicial, tercera y cuarta dosis). Especialmente preocupante es la situación de los pacientes con respuesta humoral persistentemente negativa que no seroconvierten incluso ni tras recibir las dosis de recuerdo o boosters. En ese contexto, el manejo probablemente pasa por el uso de anticuerpos monoclonales dirigidos frente a SARS-CoV-2 que han sido recientemente aprobados, asumiendo que pueden perder efectividad con el cambio del genoma viral. La presente revision tiene por objeto resumir y analizar la situación actual de la vacunación frente a SARS-CoV-2 en el espectro de la ERC enfatizando en los resultados del estudio SENCOVAC. Asimismo, a lo largo de la revisión se discuten los predictores de la respuesta a las diferentes dosis y tipos de vacunas y la integración de estas con los anticuerpos monoclonales y los agentes antivirales.

AB  - Background & aims
Greater COVID-19 related mortality has been reported among persons with various non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We performed an ecological study to determine the association of state-level cases and deaths with NCD risk factors and healthcare and social indices.
Methods
We obtained cumulative national and state-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths from publicly available database www.covid19india.org from February to end November 2020. To identify association with major NCD risk factors, NCDs, healthcare related and social variables we obtained data from public sources. Association was determined using univariate and multivariate statistics.
Results
More than 9.5 million COVID-19 cases and 135,000 deaths have been reported in India towards end of November 2020. There is significant positive correlation (Pearson r) of state-level COVID-19 cases and deaths per million, respectively, with NCD risk factors- obesity (0.64, 0.52), hypertension (0.28, 0.16), diabetes (0.66, 0.46), NCD epidemiological transition index (0.58, 0.54) and ischemic heart disease mortality (0.22, 0.33). Correlation is also observed with indices of healthcare access and quality (0.71, 0.61), urbanization (0.75, 0.73) and human (0.61, 0.56) and sociodemographic (0.70, 0.69) development. Multivariate adjusted analyses shows strong correlation of COVID-19 burden and deaths with NCD risk factors (r2 = 0.51, 0.43), NCDs (r2 = 0.32, 0.16) and healthcare (r2 = 0.52, 0.38).
Conclusions
COVID-19 disease burden and mortality in India is ecologically associated with greater state-level burden of NCDs and risk factors, especially obesity and diabetes.

AB  - Objective
Obesity is a major risk factor for adverse outcomes after COVID-19 infection. However, it is unknown if the worse outcomes are due to the confounding effect of demographic and obesity-related comorbidities. The study objective is to analyze associations between body mass index, patient characteristics, obesity-related comorbidity, and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
Methods
In this prospective cohort study, we chose patient records between March 1st, 2020, and December 1st, 2022, in a large tertiary care center in southeast Wisconsin in the United States. Patients over the age of 18 who tested positive were included in the study. Clinical outcomes included hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality rates. We examined the characteristics of patients who had positive clinical outcomes. We created unadjusted logistic regression models, sequentially adjusting for demographic and comorbidity variables, to assess the independent associations between BMI, patient characteristics, obesity-related comorbidities, and clinical outcomes.
Results
From a record of 1.67 million inpatients and outpatients at Froedtert Health Center, 55,299 (BMI: 30.5 ± 7.4 kg/m2, 62.5 % female) tested COVID-19 positive during the study period. 17,580 (31.8 %) patients were admitted to hospitals, and of hospitalized patients required ICU admission. 1038 (36.3 %) required mechanical ventilation, and 462 (44.5 %) died after a positive test for COVID-19. We found female patients show a higher hospitalization rate, while male patients have a higher rate of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Obesity-related comorbidities are associated with worse outcomes compared to simple obesity without comorbidities. In logistic regression models, we found four similar V-shaped associations between BMI and four clinical outcomes. Patients with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 are at the lowest risk for clinical outcomes. Patients with a BMI lower than 18 kg/m2 or higher than 30 kg/m2 are associated with a higher risk of hospitalization, ICU, mechanical ventilation, and death. After adjusting the model for demographic factors and hypertension and diabetes as two common comorbidities, we found that demographic factors do not significantly increase the risk. Obesity alone does not significantly increase the risk of severe clinical outcomes. Obesity-related comorbidities, on the other hand, resulted in a significantly higher risk of outcomes.
Conclusion
Obesity alone does not increase the risk of worse clinical outcomes after COVID-19 infection. It may suggest that the worse clinical outcomes of patients with obesity are mediated via hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Patients with obesity and comorbidities have a higher risk of poor outcomes. Obesity-related comorbidities, including hypertension and diabetes, are independently associated with poorer clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients. At a BMI of more than 30 kg/m2 or less than 18 kg/m2, we found an increase in the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes leading to hospitalization, ICU, mechanical ventilation, and death. The increased risk of severe outcomes is not attributed to patient characteristics but can be attributed to hypertension and diabetes.

AB  - Developing messaging to encourage minorities to adhere to health recommendations has been a complex task for governments worldwide during the COVID-19 crisis. Here, we propose and tests a new typology of messages among minorities that can be used to mobilize compliance and engagement. This typology comprises three messaging treatments emphasizing personal, ingroup, and intergroup benefits. We examine, via an experimental field study, whether there is a difference in the effect of these messages on two policy outcomes, social distancing and vaccine hesitancy, among the Arab minority living in Israel. The findings suggest that social messages, i.e., ingroup and intergroup messages, positively affect social distancing, while self-messaging harms social distancing compliance. Regarding vaccine intake, within the social messages tested, intergroup-focused messages were more effective than ingroup-focused messages for vaccination intentions only among citizens with low trust in the government. We discuss the findings in detail and propose new avenues in theory and practice to foster health policy compliance among minorities.

AB  - To contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries around the globe have adopted social distancing measures. Yet, establishing the causal effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is difficult because they do not occur arbitrarily. We exploit a quasi-random source of variation for identification purposes –namely, regional differences in the placement on the pandemic curve following an unexpected and nationwide lockdown. Our results reveal that regions where the outbreak had just started when the lockdown was implemented had 1.62 fewer daily deaths per 100,000 inhabitants when compared to regions for which the lockdown arrived 10+ days after the pandemic’s outbreak. As a result, a total of 4,642 total deaths (232 deaths/daily) could have been avoided by the end of our period of study –a figure representing 23% of registered deaths in Spain at the time. We rule out differential pre−COVID mortality trends and self-distancing behaviors across the compared regions prior to the swift lockdown, which was also uniformly observed nationwide. In addition, we provide supporting evidence for contagion deceleration as the main mechanism behind the effectiveness of the early adoption of NPIs in lowering the death rate, rather than an increased healthcare capacity.

AB  - The number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases continues to surge, overwhelming healthcare systems and causing excess mortality in many countries. Testing of infectious populations remains a key strategy to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, delay the exponential spread of the disease, and flatten the epidemic curve. Using the Omicron variant outbreak as a background, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of testing strategies with different test combinations and frequencies, analyze the factors associated with testing effectiveness, and optimize testing strategies based on these influencing factors. We developed a stochastic, agent-based, discrete-time susceptible–latent–infectious–recovered model simulating a community to estimate the association between three levels of testing strategies and COVID-19 transmission. Antigen testing and its combination strategies were more efficient than polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-related strategies. Antigen testing also showed better performance in reducing the demand for hospital beds and intensive care unit beds. The delay in the turnaround time of test results had a more significant impact on the efficiency of the testing strategy compared to the detection limit of viral load and detection-related contacts. The main advantage of antigen testing strategies is the short turnaround time, which is also a critical factor to be optimized to improve PCR strategies. After modifying the turnaround time, the strategies with less frequent testing were comparable to daily testing. The choice of testing strategy requires consideration of containment goals, test efficacy, community prevalence, and economic factors. This study provides evidence for the selection and optimization of testing strategies in the post-pandemic era and provides guidance for optimizing healthcare resources.

AB  - Summary
Background
The burden of COVID-19 in children and adolescents has increased during the delta and omicron waves, necessitating studies of long-term symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnoea and cognitive problems. Furthermore, immune responses in relation to persisting symptoms in younger people have not been well characterised. In this cohort study, we investigated the role of antibodies, vaccination and omicron reinfection upon persisting and long-term symptoms up to 8 months post-delta infection.
Methods
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive participants (n = 276, aged 10–20 years) were prospectively recruited in August 2021. We recorded the major symptoms of post COVID-19 condition and collected serum samples 3- and 8-months post delta infection. Binding antibodies were measured by spike IgG ELISA, and surrogate neutralising antibodies against Wuhan and delta variants by the hemagglutination test (HAT).
Findings
After delta infection, persisting symptoms at 3 months were significantly associated with higher delta antibody titres (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.57–6.04, p = 0.001). Asymptomatic acute infection compared to symptomatic infection lowered the risk of persisting (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02–0.55, p = 0.013) and long-term (OR 0.28 95% CI 0.11–0.66, p = 0.005) symptoms at 3 and 8 months, respectively. Adolescents (16–20 years) were more likely to have long-term symptoms compared to children (10–15 years) (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.37–4.41, p = 0.003).
Interpretation
This clinical and serological study compares long-term symptoms after delta infection between children and adolescents. The association between high antibody titres and persisting symptoms suggest the involvement of an immune mechanism. Similarly to adults, the dominant long-term symptoms in children are fatigue, dyspnoea and cognitive problems.

AB  - Crisis-induced vaccine supply chain management has recently drawn attention to the importance of immediate responses to a crisis (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic). This study develops a queuing model for a crisis-induced vaccine supply chain to ensure efficient coordination and distribution of different COVID-19 vaccine types to people with various levels of vulnerability. We define a utility function for queues to study the changes in arrival rates related to the inventory level of vaccines, the efficiency of vaccines, and a risk aversion coefficient for vaccinees. A multi-period queuing model considering congestion in the vaccination process is proposed to minimise two contradictory objectives: (i) the expected average wait time of vaccinees and (ii) the total investment in the holding and ordering of vaccines. To develop the bi-objective non-linear programming model, the goal attainment algorithm and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) are employed for small- to large-scale problems. Several solution repairs are also implemented in the classic NSGA-II algorithm to improve its efficiency. Four standard performance metrics are used to investigate the algorithm. The non-parametric Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests are applied on several numerical examples to ensure the privilege of the improved algorithm. The NSGA-II algorithm surveys an authentic case study in Australia, and several scenarios are created to provide insights for an efficient vaccination program.

AB  - Coronaviruses are pathogens thought to primarily affect the respiratory tracts of humans. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 was also marked mainly by its symptoms of respiratory illness, which were named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its initial discovery, many other symptoms have been linked to acute SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as to the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Among these symptoms are different categories of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which continue to be the main cause of death worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that 17.9 million people die from CVDs each year, accounting for ∼32% of all deaths globally. Physical inactivity is one of the most important behavioral risk factors for CVDs. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected CVDs as well as the physical activity in different ways. Here, we provide an overview of the current status as well as future challenges and possible solutions.

AB  - Several studies over the last decade demonstrate the recruitment of immune cells, increased inflammatory cytokines, and chemokine in patients with metabolic diseases, including heart failure, parenchymal inflammation, obesity, tuberculosis, and diabetes mellitus. Metabolic rewiring of immune cells is associated with the severity and prevalence of these diseases. The risk of developing COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection increases in patients with metabolic dysfunction (heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and obesity). Several etiologies, including fatigue, dyspnea, and dizziness, persist even months after COVID-19 infection, commonly known as Post-Acute Sequelae of CoV-2 (PASC) or long COVID. A chronic inflammatory state and metabolic dysfunction are the factors that contribute to long COVID. Here, this study explores the potential link between pathogenic metabolic and immune alterations across different organ systems that could underlie COVID-19 and PASC. These interactions could be utilized for targeted future therapeutic approaches.

AB  - The pandemic COVID-19 has spread widely throughout the globe and has been responsible for millions of deaths worldwide. Recently, it has been identified that there is no specific and 100% effective treatment available to manage the infection especially for the severe cases. A significant amount of research efforts and clinical trials have been undertaken globally and many more are underway to find the potential treatment option. Earlier, convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin was effectively used in the treatment of many endemic or epidemic viral infections as a part of passive immunization. In this article, we have touched upon the immunopathology of COVID-19 infection, a basic understanding of convalescent plasma, it's manufacturing as well as evaluation, and have reviewed the scientific developments focussing on the potential of convalescent plasma vis-à-vis other modalities for the management of COVID-19. The article also covers various research approaches, clinical trials conducted globally, and the clinical trials which are at various stages for exploring the efficacy and safety of the convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) to predict its future perspective to manage COVID-19.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has negatively impacted on patients of the whole CKD spectrum, causing high rates of morbi-mortality. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines opened a new era, but patients with CKD (including kidney transplant, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) were systematically excluded from pivotal clinical trials. The Spanish Society of Nephrology promoted the multicentric national SENCOVAC study aimed at assessing immunological responses after vaccination in patients with CKD. During the first year after vaccination, patients with non-dialysis CKD and those on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis presented good anti-Spike antibody responses to vaccination, especially after receiving the third and fourth doses. However, kidney transplant recipients presented suboptimal responses after any vaccination schedule (initial, third and fourth dose). Especially worrisome is the situation of a patients with a persistently negative humoral response that do not seroconvert after boosters. In this regard, monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 have been approved for high-risk patients, although they may become obsolete as the viral genome evolves. The present report reviews the current status of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the CKD spectrum with emphasis on lessons learned from the SENCOVAC study. Predictors of humoral response, including vaccination schedules and types of vaccines, as well as the integration of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antiviral agents are discussed.
Resumen
Síndrome agudo respiratorio severo coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ha impactado negativamente en todos los pacientes con enfermedad renal crónica (ERC), causando elevadas tasas de morbimortalidad. La vacunación frente a SARS-CoV-2 han abierto una nueva era, aunque precisamente los pacientes con ERC (incluyendo los portadores de un injerto renal y aquellos en programas de hemodiálisis y diálisis peritoneal) han sido sistemáticamente excluidos de los ensayos clínicos. La Sociedad Española de Nefrología (S.E.N.) promovió el estudio multicéntrico SENCOVAC para evaluar la respuesta inmunológica tras la vacunación en todo el espectro de la ERC. Un año después de haber recibido la pauta inicial de vacunación, los pacientes con ERC sin necesidad de diálisis, y aquellos en hemodiálisis y diálisis peritoneal, han presenado una adecuada respuesta humoral (monitorizada con el desarrollo de anticuerpos frente a la proteína Spike), especialmente después de recibir la tercera y la cuarta dosis. Sin embargo, los portadores de un injerto renal han presentado una constante respuesta subóptima en cualquier momento de la vacunación (dosis inicial, tercera y cuarta dosis). Especialmente preocupante es la situación de los pacientes con respuesta humoral persistentemente negativa que no seroconvierten incluso ni tras recibir las dosis de recuerdo o boosters. En ese contexto, el manejo probablemente pasa por el uso de anticuerpos monoclonales dirigidos frente a SARS-CoV-2 que han sido recientemente aprobados, asumiendo que pueden perder efectividad con el cambio del genoma viral. La presente revision tiene por objeto resumir y analizar la situación actual de la vacunación frente a SARS-CoV-2 en el espectro de la ERC enfatizando en los resultados del estudio SENCOVAC. Asimismo, a lo largo de la revisión se discuten los predictores de la respuesta a las diferentes dosis y tipos de vacunas y la integración de estas con los anticuerpos monoclonales y los agentes antivirales.

AB  - Since its first outbreak in 2020, the pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the death of almost 7 million people worldwide. Vaccines have been fundamental in disease prevention and to reduce disease severity especially in patients with comorbidities. Nevertheless, treatment of COVID-19 has been proven difficult and several approaches have failed to prevent disease onset or disease progression, particularly in patients with comorbidities. Interrogation of drug data bases has been widely used since the beginning of pandemic to repurpose existing drugs/natural substances for the prevention/treatment of COVID-19. Steroids, including bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) have shown to be promising for their potential in modulating SARS-CoV-2/host interaction. Bile acids have proven to be effective in preventing binding of spike protein with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme II (ACE2), thus preventing virus uptake by the host cells and inhibiting its replication, as well as in indirectly modulating immune response. Additionally, the two main bile acid activated receptors, GPBAR1 and FXR, have proven effective in modulating the expression of ACE2, suggesting an indirect role for these receptors in regulating SARS-CoV-2 infectiveness and immune response. In this review we have examined how the potential of bile acids and their receptors as anti-COVID-19 therapies and how these biochemical mechanisms translate into clinical efficacy.

AB  - Influenza affects millions of people worldwide each year and can lead to severe complications, hospitalizations, and even death, especially among vulnerable populations such as older adults and those with chronic medical conditions. Annual vaccination is considered the most effective measure for preventing influenza and its complications. Despite the widespread availability of influenza vaccines, however, vaccination coverage rates remain suboptimal in several countries. Based on the latest scientific evidence and expert opinions on influenza vaccination in older people and patients with chronic disease, the Portuguese Society of Pulmonology (SPP), the Portuguese Society of Diabetology (SPD), the Portuguese Society of Cardiology (SPC), the Portuguese Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology (SPGG), the Study Group of Geriatrics of the Portuguese Society of Internal Medicine (NEGERMI-SPMI), and the Portuguese Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SPDIMC) discussed best practices for promoting vaccination uptake and coverage and drew up several recommendations to mitigate the impact of influenza. These recommendations focus on the efficacy and safety of available vaccines; the impact of influenza vaccination on older adults; patients with chronic medical conditions, namely cardiac and respiratory conditions, diabetes, and immunosuppressive diseases; and health care professionals, optimal vaccination timing, and strategies to increase vaccination uptake and coverage. The resulting position paper highlights the critical role that vaccinations play in promoting public health, raising awareness, and encouraging more people to get vaccinated.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with various liver injury cases worldwide. To date, the prevalence, mechanism, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and outcomes of COVID-19-induced liver injury in various at-risk groups are not well defined. Liver injury may arise in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 from direct causes such as viral infection and indirect causes such as systemic inflammation, hypoxic changes, and drugs that exacerbate any pre-existing liver disease. Studies have found that patients with underlying liver disease are at higher risk of COVID-19-induced liver injury. Certain condition of cardiopulmonary and metabolic diseases and vulnerable stages in lifespan may also involve in the development of COVID-19-induced liver injury. This review summarized studies of COVID-19-induced liver injury in different at-risk groups regarding their clinical characteristics, parameters, and correlations of the severity with these indicators and signs as well as potential treatment suggestions, to increase attention to physiological and pathological conditions and continue liver function monitoring as they can help in strengthening early supportive treatment and reducing the incidence of adverse outcomes.

AB  - Novavax, a global vaccine company, began evaluating NVX-CoV2373 in human studies in May 2020 and the pivotal placebo-controlled phase 3 studies started in November 2020; five clinical studies provided adult and adolescent clinical data for over 31,000 participants who were administered NVX-CoV2373. This extensive data has demonstrated a well-tolerated response to NVX-CoV2373 and high vaccine efficacy against mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 using a two-dose series (Dunkle et al., 2022) [1], (Heath et al., 2021) [2], (Keech et al., 2020) [3], (Mallory et al., 2022) [4]. The most common adverse events seen after administration with NVX-CoV2373 were injection site tenderness, injection site pain, fatigue, myalgia, headache, malaise, arthralgia, nausea, or vomiting. In addition, immunogenicity against variants of interest (VOI) and variants of concern (VOC) was established with high titers of ACE2 receptor-inhibiting and neutralizing antibodies in these studies (EMA, 2022) [5], (FDA, 2023) [6]. Further studies on correlates of protection determined that titers of anti-Spike IgG and neutralizing antibodies correlated with efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 established in clinical trials (p < 0.001 for recombinant protein vaccine and p = 0.005 for mRNA vaccines for IgG levels) (Fong et al., 2022) [7]. Administration of a booster dose of the recombinant protein vaccine approximately 6 months following the primary two-dose series resulted in substantial increases in humoral antibodies against both the prototype strain and all evaluated variants, similar to or higher than the antibody levels observed in phase 3 studies that were associated with high vaccine efficacy (Dunkle et al., 2022) [1], (Mallory et al., 2022) [4]. These findings, together with the well tolerated safety profile, support use of the recombinant protein vaccine as primary series and booster regimens.

AB  - The first wave of Covid-19 pandemic had a geographically heterogeneous impact even within the most severely hit regions. Exploiting a triple-differences methodology, we find that in Italy Covid-19 hit relatively harder in peripheral areas: the excess mortality in peripheral areas was almost double that of central ones in March 2020 (1.2 additional deaths every 1000 inhabitants). We leverage a rich dataset on Italian municipalities to explore mechanisms behind this gradient. We first show that socio-demographic and economic features at municipal level are highly collinear, making it hard to identify single-variable causal relationships. Using Principal Components Analysis we model excess mortality and show that areas with higher excess mortality have lower income, lower education, larger households, lower trade and higher industrial employments, and older population. Our findings highlight a strong centre-periphery gradient in the harshness of Covid-19, which we believe is also highly relevant from a policy-making standpoint.

AB  - The novel coronavirus pandemic has radically changed the landscape of normal surgical practice. Lifesaving cancer surgery, however, remains a clinical priority, and there is an increasing need to fully define the optimal oncologic management of patients with varying stages of lung cancer, allowing prioritization of which thoracic procedures should be performed in the current era. Healthcare providers and managers should not ignore the risk of a bimodal peak of mortality in patients with lung cancer; an imminent spike due to mortality from acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, and a secondary peak reflecting an excess of cancer-related mortality among patients whose treatments were deemed less urgent, delayed, or cancelled. The European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Thoracic Anesthesia Subspecialty group has considered these challenges and developed an updated set of expert recommendations concerning the infectious period, timing of surgery, vaccination, preoperative screening and evaluation, airway management, and ventilation of thoracic surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background
Women who received a COVID-19 vaccination may display subclinical unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy on screening mammography, which can appear suspicious for malignancy, leading to additional diagnostic evaluation.
Purpose
To evaluate the prevalence of subclinical unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy (sLAD) on screening mammogram in women who received either the first or second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech (Pfizer) or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines compared to women who have not.
Materials and Methods
In this IRB-approved, HIPAA complaint study from 12/14/2020 to 4/14/2021, 1027 patients presented for screening mammography and met study inclusion criteria. Patients with history of baseline lymphadenopathy or prior cancer diagnosis were excluded.
Results
: Of the 1027 women, 43 were recalled for unilateral sLAD. 34 women received a COVID-19 vaccination ipsilateral to the sLAD (Pfizer n=19, 44.2%; Moderna n=15, 34.9%), 9 did not (20.9%). Incidence of unilateral axillary sLAD was significantly higher (p-value<0.01) in those who received a COVID-19 vaccination within approximately 7 weeks preceding screening mammogram. 13.2% of patients who received the Pfizer vaccine and 9.5% of patients who received the Moderna vaccine developed sLAD. Moderna's vaccine elicited a more robust reaction in the elderly (Moderna 63.7 years vs. Pfizer 59.7 years). For both vaccines, sLAD resolved on average 46.5 days after the last COVID-19 vaccine (p=0.44).
Conclusion
Women who have received either mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may benefit from scheduling their screening mammogram before vaccination or consider delaying screening mammography 8 weeks. While Pfizer may have an overall more robust immune response, Moderna may elicit a stronger immune response in elderly women.
Summary
Women who received a COVID-19 vaccination before screening mammography were significantly more likely to present with subclinical axillary lymphadenopathy than women who did not receive the vaccine.
Key Results
13.2% of women who received a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine exhibited subclinical axillary lymphadenopathy compared to 9.5% of those who received the Moderna vaccine. Only 1.2 % of those who did not receive a vaccine presented with subclinical unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. The average time of resolution of the lymphadenopathy on diagnostic mammogram was 46.5 days overall, with Pfizer-BioNTech taking 50.7 days and Moderna 41.5 days.

AB  - Background
Influenza causes excessive morbidity and mortality among older adults. While influenza vaccine provides protection against its infection, the vaccination coverage in China among older adults has been very low. Previous evidence on the cost-effectiveness of government-sponsored free influenza vaccination programs in China was primarily based on literature data, which might not always reflect real-world patient populations. The Yinzhou Health Information System (YHIS) is a regional database that captures electronic health records, insurance claims data, etc. for all residents in Yinzhou district, Zhejiang province, China. We will use YHIS to study the effectiveness, influenza-related direct medical cost and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of the free influenza vaccination program for older adults. In this paper, we describe the study design and innovations in detail.
Methods
We will establish a retrospective cohort of permanent older residents aged 65 and over, using YHIS between 2016 and 2021. We will estimate the vaccine coverage rate, influenza incidence rate and influenza-related direct medical cost from 2016 to 2021. Regression discontinuity will be used to estimate vaccine effectiveness for the 2020/2021 season. We will build a decision tree model to compare the cost-effectiveness of three influenza vaccination options (free trivalent influenza vaccine, free quadrivalent influenza vaccine, and no policy) from both societal and health system perspectives. Parameter inputs will be gathered from both YHIS and published literature. We will calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) discounted at 5 % annually.
Discussion
Our CEA solidifies multiple sources including regional real-world data and literature for a rigorous evaluation of the government-sponsored free influenza vaccination program. The results will provide real-world evidence from real-world data on the cost-effectiveness of a real-world policy. Our findings are expected to support evidence-based policy making and to promote health for older adults.

AB  - Pre-existing heart failure (HF) in diagnosed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a close to two-fold increased mortality rate compared to COVID-19 patients without prior HF history. Moreover, based both on biomarker as well as imaging findings, widespread endothelial and cardiac injury seems to be present in many patients presenting with COVID-19, associated with adverse outcomes including new onset HF. Systematic echocardiographic studies in patients with COVID-19 indicate that the most common cardiac pathology is right ventricular (RV) dilatation (39%) over and above both left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (16%) and LV systolic dysfunction (10%). In addition, myocardial injury, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is observed in some 55% to 70% of patients recently recovered from COVID-19 even in those who didn’t get very sick during the acute illness. These observations seem to indicate a potentially rather high risk of clinical HF emerging in patients post-COVID-19, warranting close long-term monitoring of patients during recovery. On the other hand, given the established adverse prognostic role that pre-existing HF plays as a comorbidity in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, it not only seems important in the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that all patients with known HF should proactively be well controlled and treated according to current guidelines, but also additionally be considered for priority vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 infection if not yet vaccinated.

AB  - Background
People with disabilities might experience worse clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but evidence is limited.
Objective
To investigate if people with disabilities requiring assistance are more likely to experience severe COVID-19 or death.
Methods
Data from the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Precision Medicine Analytics Platform Registry (JH-CROWN) included 6494 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted between March 4, 2020–October 29, 2021. Severe COVID-19 and death were defined using the occurrence and timing of clinical events. Assistive needs due to disabilities were reported by patients or their proxies upon admission. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations between disability status and severe COVID-19 or death. Primary models adjusted for demographics and secondary models additionally adjusted for clinical covariates.
Results
In this clinical cohort (47–73 years, 49% female, 39% Black), patients with disabilities requiring assistance had 1.35 times (95% confidence interval [CI]:1.01, 1.81) the hazard of severe COVID-19 among patients <65 years, but not among those ≥65 years, equating to an additional 17.5 severe COVID-19 cases (95% CI:7.7, 28.2) per 100 patients. A lower risk of mortality was found among patients <65 years, but this finding was not robust due to the small number of deaths.
Conclusions
People with disabilities requiring assistance aged <65 years are more likely to develop severe COVID-19. Although our study is limited by using a medical model of disability, these analyses intend to further our understanding of COVID-19 outcomes among people with disabilities. Also, standardized disability data collection within electronic health records is needed.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had an unprecedented effect on global health, mortality and healthcare provision. Diabetes has emerged as a key disease entity over the pandemic period, influencing outcomes from COVID-19 but also a tantalising hypothesis that the virus itself may be inducing diabetes. An uptick in diabetes cases over the pandemic has been noted for both type 1 diabetes (in children) and type 2 diabetes but understanding how this increase in incidence relates to the pandemic is challenging. It remains unclear whether indirect effects of the pandemic on behaviour, lifestyle and health have contributed to the increase; whether the virus itself has somehow mediated new-onset diabetes or whether other factors such as stress hyperglycaemic of steroid treatment during COVID-19 infection have played a roll. Within the myriad possibilities are some real challenges in interpreting epidemiological data, assigning diabetes type and understanding what in vitro data are telling us. In this review article we address the issue of newly-diagnosed diabetes during the pandemic, reviewing both epidemiological and basic science data and bringing together both strands of this emerging story.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), which began as a small outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, became a global pandemic within months due to its high transmissibility. In the absence of pharmaceutical treatment, various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain the spread of COVID-19 brought the entire world to a halt. After almost a year of seemingly returning to normalcy with the world's quickest vaccine development, the emergence of more infectious and vaccine resistant coronavirus variants is bringing the situation back to where it was a year ago. In the light of this new situation, we conducted a study to portray the possible scenarios based on the three key factors: impact of interventions (pharmaceutical and NPIs), vaccination rate, and vaccine efficacy. In our study, we assessed two of the most crucial factors, transmissibility and vaccination rate, in order to reduce the spreading of COVID-19 in a simple but effective manner. In order to incorporate the time-varying mutational landscape of COVID-19 variants, we estimated a weighted transmissibility composed of the proportion of existing strains that naturally vary over time. Additionally, we consider time varying vaccination rates based on the number of daily new cases. Our method for calculating the vaccination rate from past active cases is an effective approach in forecasting probable future scenarios as it actively tracks people's attitudes toward immunization as active case changes. Our simulations show that if a large number of individuals cannot be vaccinated by ensuring high efficacy in a short period of time, adopting NPIs is the best approach to manage disease transmission with the emergence of new vaccine breakthrough and more infectious variants.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global crisis, and medical systems in many countries are overwhelmed with supply shortages and increasing demands to treat patients due to the surge in cases and severe illnesses. This study aimed to assess COVID-19-related essential clinical resource demands in China, based on different scenarios involving COVID-19 spreads and interventions. We used a susceptible–exposed–infectious–hospitalized/isolated–removed (SEIHR) transmission dynamics model to estimate the number of COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations with corresponding essential healthcare resources needed. We found that, under strict non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) or mass vaccination of the population, China would be able to contain community transmission and local outbreaks rapidly. However, under scenarios involving a low intensity of implemented NPIs and a small proportion of the population vaccinated, the use of a peacetime–wartime transition model would be needed for medical source stockpiles and preparations to ensure a normal functioning healthcare system. The implementation of COVID-19 vaccines and NPIs in different periods can influence the transmission of COVID-19 and subsequently affect the demand for clinical diagnosis and treatment. An increased proportion of asymptomatic infections in simulations will not reduce the demand for medical resources; however, attention must be paid to the increasing difficulty in containing COVID-19 transmission due to asymptomatic cases. This study provides evidence for emergency preparations and the adjustment of prevention and control strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also provides guidance for essential healthcare investment and resource allocation.

AB  - As of 6 June 2022, a sum 25,782 of active cases and 524,701 deaths due to Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) have been recorded in India. Stewing in the flares of the pandemic, Kerala is entwined in the wrath of multiple emerging infectious diseases. India, a home to 1.3 billion people, recently faced a devastating second wave of COVID-19 during May of 2021, with a ruckus of chronic shortage of medicine, oxygen supplies, ventilators, besides, being challenged by secondary infections and chronic health ailments. The state of Kerala, alone contributes to 50% COVID-19 caseload, besides, recent simultaneous outbreaks of Zika Virus Disease (ZVD), Nipah Virus Disease (NiVD) and Kala-azar (black fever) on July 8, September 5 and 8, 2021 respectively. Syndemicity and a high case fatality rates of these highly contagious diseases coupled with post infection sequelae, overwhelm the already fragile healthcare system. Thus, these lethal infectious diseases along with an anticipated third wave of COVID-19 pose a serious public health threat in and around South India. With this narrative review, we aim to discuss the challenges that the emergence of intersecting outbreaks of Zika, Nipah, Kala-azar presents with, in the nation, amidst the global pandemic of COVID-19 and provide recommendations so as to help alleviate the situation. The syndemicity of COVID-19 with other infectious diseases, calls for adequate surveillance and monitoring of diseases’ outbreaks. To avoid the worst situations like pandemic, the health ministry, public and private health stakeholders in India should strengthen the public healthcare delivery system and providence of quick medical facilities to control the rate of mortality and morbidity during outbreaks.

AB  - We develop a simple model of vaccine prioritization for a potential pandemic. We illustrate how the model applies to the case of Covid-19, using an early 2020 primitive estimate of occupation-based exposure risks and age-based infection fatality rates. Even based on primitive estimates the vaccine distribution strongly emphasizes age-based mortality risk rather than occupation-based exposure risk. Among others, our result suggests that 50-year-old food-processing workers and 60-year-old financial advisors should have been equally prioritized. We also find that the priorities minimally change when certain populations’ exposure risks are altered by targeted stay-at-home orders or call-up of essential workers.

AB  - Previous research on commercial determinants of health has primarily focused on their impact on non-communicable diseases. However, they also impact on infectious diseases and on the broader preconditions for health. We describe, through case studies in 16 countries, how commercial determinants of health were visible during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how they may have influenced national responses and health outcomes. We use a comparative qualitative case study design in selected low- middle- and high-income countries that performed differently in COVID-19 health outcomes, and for which we had country experts to lead local analysis. We created a data collection framework and developed detailed case studies, including extensive grey and peer-reviewed literature. Themes were identified and explored using iterative rapid literature reviews. We found evidence of the influence of commercial determinants of health in the spread of COVID-19. This occurred through working conditions that exacerbated spread, including precarious, low-paid employment, use of migrant workers, procurement practices that limited the availability of protective goods and services such as personal protective equipment, and commercial actors lobbying against public health measures. Commercial determinants also influenced health outcomes by influencing vaccine availability and the health system response to COVID-19. Our findings contribute to determining the appropriate role of governments in governing for health, wellbeing, and equity, and regulating and addressing negative commercial determinants of health.

AB  - Pandemic dynamics and health care responses are markedly different during the COVID-19 pandemic than in earlier outbreaks. Compared with established infectious disease such as influenza, we currently know relatively little about the origin, reservoir, cross-species transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Health care services, drug availability, laboratory testing, research capacity and global governance are more advanced than during 20th century pandemics, although COVID-19 has highlighted significant gaps. The risk of zoonotic transmission and an associated new pandemic is rising substantially. COVID-19 vaccine development has been done at unprecedented speed, with the usual sequential steps done in parallel. The pandemic has illustrated the feasibility of this approach and the benefits of a globally coordinated response and infrastructure. Some of the COVID-19 vaccines recently developed or currently in development might offer flexibility or sufficiently broad protection to swiftly respond to antigenic drift or emergence of new coronaviruses. Yet many challenges remain, including the large-scale production of sufficient quantity of vaccines, delivery of vaccines to all countries and ensuring vaccination of relevant age groups. This wide vaccine technology approach will be best employed in tandem with active surveillance for emerging variants or new pathogens using antigen mapping, metagenomics and next generation sequencing.

AB  - Few multi-wave longitudinal studies have examined changes in drinking across extended periods of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Using multiple indicators over three years, the current study examined: a) overall drinking changes; b) sex, income, age, and pre-COVID drinking level as moderators of changes; and c) the clinical significance of the observed changes. Using a longitudinal observational cohort design with nonclinical adults from the general community (N = 1395), assessments were collected over nine waves, two pre-COVID (April 2019 and October 2019) and seven intra-COVID (April 2020–April 2022). Drinking was measured as percent drinking days, percent heavy drinking days, and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score. Clinically significant changes were defined based on the World Health Organization risk levels. All indicators exhibited significant changes from pre-pandemic to intra-pandemic periods, with drinking changes comprising early pandemic increases followed by subsequent decreases and AUDIT scores consistently declining. Pre-pandemic drinking level substantially moderated all changes. Heavier drinkers exhibited larger decreases compared to other drinking groups. In terms of clinically important changes, ∼10% of pre-pandemic abstinent or low-risk drinkers transitioned to medium- or high-risk status during the pandemic. In contrast, 37.1% of medium-risk drinkers and 44.6% of high-risk drinkers exhibited clinically significant decreases during the intra-pandemic period. Collectively, these findings highlight the multifarious impacts of the pandemic on drinking over time, comprising both increases and decreases in drinking behaviour.

AB  - Summary
With COVID-19 becoming endemic, there is a continuing need to find biomarkers characterizing the disease and aiding in patient stratification. We studied the relation between COVID-19 and cholesterol biosynthesis by comparing 10 intermediates of cholesterol biosynthesis during the hospitalization of 164 patients (admission, disease deterioration, discharge) admitted to the University Medical Center of Ljubljana. The concentrations of zymosterol, 24-dehydrolathosterol, desmosterol, and zymostenol were significantly altered in COVID-19 patients. We further developed a predictive model for disease severity based on clinical parameters alone and their combination with a subset of sterols. Our machine learning models applying 8 clinical parameters predicted disease severity with excellent accuracy (AUC = 0.96), showing substantial improvement over current clinical risk scores. After including sterols, model performance remained better than COVID-GRAM. This is the first study to examine cholesterol biosynthesis during COVID-19 and shows that a subset of cholesterol-related sterols is associated with the severity of COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
The Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) have experienced the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in different ways and with different timelines, with some experiencing large outbreaks leading to high levels of morbidity and mortality with significant strain on health systems, while others have had no local transmission or delayed transmission until after vaccine rollouts started. Regardless of COVID-19 trends, the pandemic has had a large impact on the social, political, and economic landscape in the Pacific, the effects of which are still being understood. However, the pandemic has also put renewed focus and investment into public health systems and provided an opportunity for the PICTs to build on existing systems and recent capacity strengthening to improve public health in the Region.

AB  - There has been substantial excess morbidity and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic, not all of which was directly attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and many non-COVID-19 deaths were cardiovascular. The indirect effects of the pandemic have been profound, resulting in a substantial increase in the burden of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors, both in individuals who survived SARS-CoV-2 infection and in people never infected. In this report, we review the direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiovascular and cardiometabolic disease burden in COVID-19 survivors as well as the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cardiovascular health of people who were never infected with SARS-CoV-2. We also examine the pandemic effects on health care systems and particularly the care deficits caused (or exacerbated) by health care delayed or foregone during the COVID-19 pandemic. We review the consequences of: (1) deferred/delayed acute care for urgent conditions; (2) the shift to virtual provision of outpatient care; (3) shortages of drugs and devices, and reduced access to: (4) diagnostic testing, (5) cardiac rehabilitation, and (6) homecare services. We discuss the broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for cardiovascular health and cardiovascular practitioners as we move forward into the next phase of the pandemic.
Résumé
Durant la pandémie de COVID-19, les taux de surmorbidité et de surmortalité étaient considérables, mais pas toujours directement attribuables à l’infection par le SRAS-CoV-2, et de nombreux décès non liés à la COVID-19 étaient d’origine cardiovasculaire. La pandémie a eu de graves effets indirects qui ont augmenté sensiblement le fardeau des maladies vasculaires et les facteurs de risque cardiovasculaire, aussi bien chez les personnes qui ont survécu à une infection par le SRAS-CoV-2 que chez celles qui n’ont jamais contracté le virus. Nous examinons ici l’effet direct de l’infection par le SRAS-CoV-2 sur le fardeau des maladies cardiovasculaires et cardiométaboliques chez les survivants de la COVID-19, ainsi que les effets indirects de la pandémie sur la santé cardiovasculaire des personnes n’ayant jamais été infectées par le SRAS-CoV-2. Nous traitons aussi des effets de la pandémie sur les systèmes de soins de santé, en particulier des problèmes causés (ou exacerbés) par le report des soins ou le renoncement aux soins durant la pandémie. Nous passons en revue les conséquences : 1) du report ou du retard des soins dans les cas urgents; 2) de la transition vers la virtualisation des soins externes; 3) des pénuries de médicaments et d’appareils médicaux; ainsi que des difficultés d’accès : 4) aux tests diagnostiques, 5) aux services de réadaptation cardiaque et 6) aux soins à domicile. Nous présentons par ailleurs les conséquences globales de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur la santé cardiovasculaire et sur les praticiens en santé cardiovasculaire au moment où commence une nouvelle phase de la pandémie.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 is known to be associated with a myriad of cardiovascular (CV) complications during acute illness, but the rates of readmissions for CV complications after COVID-19 infection are less well established.
Methods
The US Nationwide Readmission Database was utilized to identify COVID-19 admissions that occurred in the period from April 1st to November 30th, 2020, using International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, Clinical Modification administrative claims.
Results
A total of 521,351 admissions for COVID-19 were identified. The all-cause 30-day readmission rate was 11.6% (n = 60,262). The incidence of CV-related readmissions was 5.1% (n = 26,725), accounting for 44.3% of all-cause 30-day readmissions. Both CV-related and non-CV-related readmissions occurred at a median of 7 days. Patients readmitted with CV causes had a higher comorbidity burden, with a median Charlson comorbidity score of 6. The most common CV cause of readmission was acute heart failure (8.5%), followed by acute myocardial infarction (5.2%). Venous thromboembolism and stroke during 30-day readmission occurred at rates of 4.6% and 3.6%, respectively. Stress cardiomyopathy and acute myocarditis were less frequent, with incidences of 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. CV-related readmissions were associated with higher mortality, compared with non-CV-related readmissions (16.5% vs 7.5%, P < 0.01). Each 30-day CV-related readmission was associated with greater cost of care than each non-CV-related readmission ($13,803 vs $10,310, P < 0.01).
Conclusions
Among survivors of index COVID-19 admission, 44.7% of all 30-day readmissions were attributed to CV causes. Acute heart failure remains the most common cause of readmission after COVID-19, followed closely by acute myocardial infarction. CV causes of readmissions remain a significant source of mortality, morbidity, and resource utilization.
Résumé
Contexte
La COVID-19 est connue pour être associée à une myriade de complications cardiovasculaires (CV) durant la maladie en phase aiguë, mais les taux de nouvelles hospitalisations pour des complications CV après une infection par le virus causant la COVID-19 sont moins bien établis.
Méthodologie
La Nationwide Readmission Database des États-Unis a servi à recenser les hospitalisations pour la COVID-19 dans la période allant du 1er avril au 30 novembre 2020, à l’aide de la Classification internationale des maladies, 10e révision, modifications cliniques, selon les données administratives sur les demandes de remboursement.
Résultats
Au total, 521 351 hospitalisations pour la COVID-19 ont été recensées. Le taux de nouvelle hospitalisation à 30 jours, toutes causes confondues, a été de 11,6 % (n = 60 262). La fréquence de nouvelles hospitalisations liées à des causes CV a été de 5,1 % (n = 26 725), ce qui représente 44,3 % des nouvelles hospitalisations à 30 jours, toutes causes confondues. Les nouvelles hospitalisations, liées ou non liées à des causes CV, se sont produites à une médiane de sept jours. Les patients réadmis à l’hôpital pour des causes CV avaient un plus lourd fardeau de comorbidité, la valeur médiane du score de comorbidité de Charlson étant de 6. La cause CV la plus fréquente de nouvelle hospitalisation a été une insuffisance cardiaque aiguë (8,5 %), suivie d’un infarctus aigu du myocarde (5,2 %). Une thromboembolie veineuse et un accident vasculaire cérébral sont survenus durant une nouvelle hospitalisation dans les 30 jours à des taux de 4,6 % et de 3,6 %, respectivement. Une cardiomyopathie de stress et une myocardite aiguë ont été signalées à des fréquences moindres de 0,1 % et de 0,2 %, respectivement. Les nouvelles hospitalisations pour des causes CV ont été associées à une mortalité accrue comparativement aux nouvelles hospitalisations pour des causes autres que CV (16,5 % contre 7,5 %; p < 0,01). Les coûts des soins de santé associés à chaque nouvelle hospitalisation liée à une cause CV à 30 jours ont été plus élevés que pour chaque nouvelle hospitalisation non liée à une cause CV (13 803 $ contre 10 310 $; p < 0,01).
Conclusions
Chez les survivants de la première hospitalisation pour la COVID-19, 44,7 % des nouvelles hospitalisations à 30 jours ont été attribuées à des causes CV. Une insuffisance cardiaque aiguë demeure la principale cause de nouvelle hospitalisation après la COVID-19, suivie de près par un infarctus aigu du myocarde. Les causes CV des nouvelles hospitalisations sont encore une importante source de mortalité, de morbidité et d’utilisation des ressources.

AB  - This review shows that relatively simple changes to diet and lifestyle can significantly, and rapidly, reduce the risks associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in terms of infection risk, severity of disease, and even disease-related mortality. A wide range of interventions including regular exercise, adequate sleep, plant-based diets, maintenance of healthy weight, dietary supplementation, and time in nature have each been shown to have beneficial effects for supporting more positive health outcomes with COVID-19, in addition to promoting better overall health. This paper brings together literature from these areas and presents the argument that non-pharmaceutical approaches should not be overlooked in our response to COVID-19. It is noted that, in several cases, interventions discussed result in risk reductions equivalent to, or even greater than, those associated with currently available vaccines. Where the balance of evidence suggests benefits, and the risk is minimal to none, it is suggested that communicating the power of individual actions to the public becomes morally imperative. Further, many lives could be saved, and many harms from the vaccine mandates avoided, if we were willing to embrace this lifestyle-centred approach in our efforts to deal with COVID-19.

AB  - COVID-19 has exposed major weaknesses in the healthcare settings. The surge in COVID-19 cases increases the demands of health care, endangers vulnerable patients, and threats occupational safety. In contrast to a hospital outbreak of SARS leading to a whole hospital quarantined, at least 54 hospital outbreaks following a COVID-19 surge in the community were controlled by strengthened infection prevention and control measures for preventing transmission from community to hospitals as well as within hospitals. Access control measures include establishing triage, epidemic clinics, and outdoor quarantine stations. Visitor access restriction is applied to inpatients to limit the number of visitors. Health monitoring and surveillance is applied to healthcare personnel, including self-reporting travel declaration, temperature, predefined symptoms, and test results. Isolation of the confirmed cases during the contagious period and quarantine of the close contacts during the incubation period are critical for containment. The target populations and frequency of SARS-CoV-2 PCR and rapid antigen testing depend on the level of transmission. Case investigation and contact tracing should be comprehensive to identify the close contacts to prevent further transmission. These facility-based infection prevention and control strategies help reduce hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to a minimum in Taiwan.

AB  - Several waves of COVID-19 caused by different SARS-CoV-2 variants have been recorded worldwide. During this period, many publications were released describing the influence of various factors, such as environmental, social and economic factors, on the spread of COVID-19. This paper presents the results of a detailed spatiotemporal analysis of the course of COVID-19 cases and deaths in five waves in Poland in relation to green‒blue spaces. The results, based on 380 counties, reveal that the negative correlation between the indicator of green‒blue space per inhabitant and the average daily number of COVID-19 cases and deaths was clearly visible during all waves. These relationships were described by a power equation (coefficient of determination ranging from 0.83 to 0.88) with a high level of significance. The second important discovery was the fact that the rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths were significantly higher in urban counties (low values of the green–blue space indicator in m2/people) than in rural areas. The developed models can be used in decision-making by local government authorities to organize anti-COVID-19 prevention measures, including local lockdowns, especially in urban areas.

AB  - Background
The risks of hospital admission for COVID-19-related conditions and all-cause death of SARS-CoV-2 infected cancer patients were investigated according to vaccination status.
Methods
A population-based cohort study was carried out on 9754 infected cancer patients enrolled from January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022. Subdistribution hazard ratio (SHRs) or hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for sex, age, comorbidity index, and time since cancer incidence, were computed to assess the risk of COVID-19 hospital admission or death of unvaccinated vs. patients with at least one dose of vaccine (i.e., vaccinated).
Results
2485 unvaccinated patients (25.5 %) were at a 2.57 elevated risk of hospital admission (95 % CI: 2.13–2.87) and at a 3.50 elevated risk of death (95 % CI: 3.19–3.85), as compared to vaccinated patients. Significantly elevated hospitalizations and death risks emerged for both sexes, across all age groups and time elapsed since cancer diagnosis. For unvaccinated patients, SHRs for hospitalization were particularly elevated in those with solid tumors (SHR = 2.69 vs. 1.66 in patients with hematologic tumors) while HRs for the risk of death were homogeneously distributed. As compared to boosted patients, SHRs for hospitalization and HRs for death increased with decreasing number of doses.
Conclusions
Study findings stress the importance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to reduce hospital admission and death risk in cancer patients.

There are several retrospective studies that establish a relationship between some risk factors (cardiovascular risks mainly) and the development of COVID-19 and a severe outcome. Thus, our aim with this study is to find out the former relationship among the population within our basic health area
Method
Cohort study. The study sample consisted of 372 patients aged 14 or older who had tested positive for COVID-19 in our health centre by consecutive sampling. Data collected from medical records will be analysed using Frequencies, X2 with a Confidence interval of 95% and those carrying out the study will have prior experience/training in research and will be specifically trained for the aim of this research.
Results
A worse outcome in patients aged 76 years old on average was found versus patients aged 48.7. Regarding high blood pressure patients, X2 was <0.001 and OR between 3.975 and 21.425 with confidence interval of 95%, finding a worse outcome in these patients. With regard to Diabetes Mellitus (DM), X2 was <0.001 and OR rated between 2.766 and 12.690 with a confidence interval of 95%, also resulting in a worse outcome in these patients. No significant differences regarding a worse outcome were found in Body Mass Index, gender, or toxic habits.
Conclusions
Older patients had a worse outcome from COVID-19, as well as patients with high blood pressure or DM. We found no differences regarding gender and neither could we find any differences regarding BMI.
Resumen
Objetivos
La bibliografía consultada, en su mayoría estudios descriptivos, establece asociación entre factores de riesgo para la salud, en su mayoría cardiovasculares, y la mala evolución de la COVID-19. Este estudio pretende mostrar dicha asociación entre la población perteneciente al área de salud zona vi de Albacete (España)
Método
Estudio de cohortes de carácter retrospectivo. Mediante muestreo consecutivo se ha obtenido una muestra de 372 pacientes, mayores de 14 años, con diagnóstico confirmado de COVID-19. Los grupos se han dividido entre buena y mala evolución, entendiendo esta última como ingreso en UCI y/o muerte. Los datos obtenidos mediante la explotación de historias clínicas han sido analizados obteniendo frecuencias, Chi cuadrado con intervalo de confianza al 95% y ajustando por factores de confusión.
Resultados
Por edad los pacientes con mala evolución tenían una media de 76 años, frente a los 48,7 años de los pacientes que evolucionaron favorablemente. Los pacientes con HTA presentaron peor evolución; siendo la Chi cuadrado <0,001 y la OR, para un intervalo de confianza del 95%, estuvo entre 3,97 y 21,42. En los paciente con DM también se relacionó la mala evolución de la enfermedad, siendo la Chi cuadrado <0,001 y la OR, para un intervalo de confianza del 95%, entre 2.766 y 12.690. Los pacientes que presentaban DM + HTA tenían un riesgo 5 veces superior de mala evolución respecto a los que solo presentaban una de las enfermedades. Nuestro estudio no pudo encontrar diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre el IMC, el sexo y los hábitos tóxicos (consumo de alcohol, tabaco y drogas) y la mala evolución de la COVID-19.
Conclusiones
Los pacientes de mayor edad tuvieron un peor desenlace de la enfermedad, así como los hipertensos y diabéticos. No se encontró relación entre la evolución y la distribución por sexos. No se pudo establecer relación entre el IMC y hábitos tóxicos y la mala evolución.

AB  - The first case of COVID-19 in Yemen was confirmed on 10 April 2020. Having faced with a six-year long conflict that has destroyed half of its healthcare facilities and displaced millions, predictions of infections and mortality in Yemen suggested a looming healthcare catastrophe. Difficulty in implementing coordinated lockdowns and preventive measures due to the daily labor working nature of the majority of the population, provided the perfect breeding ground for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, official figures of infections and mortality are very low and there have not been confirmed reports of excess mortality. This could indicate that Yemen is silently marching towards forced herd immunity. Seroprevalence studies will provide useful insight into the COVID-19 transmission trajectory in Yemen, which can serve as a guide in planning vaccine distribution strategies and allocating the limited funds wisely.

AB  - Summary
The assessment of the efficacy and safety of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in actual practice is extremely important, and monitoring efforts are being implemented worldwide. In Japan, a joint council in the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is held every two to three weeks to summarise information on the adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination, with careful assessment of individual case safety reports and comparison with background incidence rates. In 2021, the joint council mainly reviewed anaphylaxis, death, myocarditis/pericarditis, and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. These activities resulted in several safety-related regulatory actions, including the revision of vaccine package inserts with warnings about myocarditis/pericarditis. International sharing of vaccine safety information, as well as details of the evaluation systems, is important for international discussion and decision-making on better safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to millions of deaths worldwide after its emergence in 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily affects respiratory function, but immune dysregulation leading to systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulopathy can predispose to systemic complications including hematologic and vascular complications. Treatment strategies for patients with COVID-19 have rapidly evolved and the effectiveness and safety of antithrombotic agents have been evaluated in multiple clinical trials. The findings have spurred interest in the prevention and treatment of the hematologic and vascular complications of non-COVID-19 respiratory infections. This review is focused on hematological and vascular complications of COVID-19, including their pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management. Because of the perpetually changing nature of the disease, the review places previous data in temporal contexts and outlines potential next steps for future research in COVID-19 and other severe respiratory infections.
Résumé
La pandémie de COVID-19 a entraîné des millions de décès dans le monde après son apparition en 2020. Le virus SRAS-CoV-2 qui en est responsable affecte principalement la fonction respiratoire, mais des dérèglements immunitaires menant à une inflammation généralisée, à une dysfonction endothéliale et à une coagulopathie peuvent prédisposer certaines personnes à des complications systémiques, notamment des complications hématologiques et vasculaires. Les stratégies de traitement pour les patients atteints de la COVID-19 ont évolué rapidement, et de nombreux essais cliniques ont porté sur l’efficacité et l’innocuité des agents antithrombotiques. Les conclusions ont suscité un intérêt envers la prévention et le traitement des complications hématologiques et vasculaires attribuables aux infections respiratoires autres que la COVID-19. Cette synthèse relève les complications hématologiques et vasculaires de la COVID-19, de même que leur physiopathologie, leurs manifestations cliniques et leur prise en charge. En raison de l’évolution continue de la maladie, les données précédentes sont placées dans leur contexte temporel, et des axes de recherche sur la COVID-19 et d’autres infections respiratoires graves sont proposés.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation are particularly at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Risk factors and the prognostic impact of developing VAP during critical COVID-19 have not been fully documented.
Methods
Patients invasively ventilated for at least 48 h from the prospective multicentre COVID-ICU database were included in the analyses. Cause-specific Cox regression models were used to determine factors associated with the occurrence of VAP. Cox-regression multivariable models were used to determine VAP prognosis. Risk factors and the prognostic impact of early vs. late VAP, and Pseudomonas-related vs. non-Pseudomonas-related VAP were also determined.
Main findings
3388 patients were analysed (63 [55–70] years, 75.8% males). VAP occurred in 1523/3388 (45.5%) patients after 7 [5–9] days of ventilation. Identified bacteria were mainly Enterobacteriaceae followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. VAP risk factors were male gender (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.26, 95% Confidence Interval [1.09–1.46]), concomitant bacterial pneumonia at ICU admission (HR 1.36 [1.10–1.67]), PaO2/FiO2 ratio at intubation (HR 0.99 [0.98–0.99] per 10 mmHg increase), neuromuscular-blocking agents (HR 0.89 [0.76–0.998]), and corticosteroids (HR 1.27 [1.09–1.47]). VAP was associated with 90-mortality (HR 1.34 [1.16–1.55]), predominantly due to late VAP (HR 1.51 [1.26–1.81]). The impact of Pseudomonas-related and non-Pseudomonas-related VAP on mortality was similar.
Conclusion
VAP affected almost half of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. Several risk factors have been identified, among which modifiable risk factors deserve further investigation. VAP had a specific negative impact on 90-day mortality, particularly when it occurred between the end of the first week and the third week of ventilation.

AB  - Summary
Background
Because evidence on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in older adults is scarce, we aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk of adverse events after CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech) vaccination in adults aged 60 years or older.
Methods
In this modified self-controlled case series, we enrolled adults aged 60 years or older who had received at least one dose of CoronaVac in Hong Kong between Feb 23, 2021, and Jan 31, 2022. We extracted population-based, electronic health record data from the clinical management system of the Hospital Authority on adverse events of special interest (from Jan 1, 2005, to Feb 23, 2022) and patients' demographic information (from Jan 1, 2018, to Jan 31, 2022), previous diagnoses (from Jan 1, 2018, to Jan 31, 2022), medication history (from Jan 1, 2018, to Jan 31, 2022), and laboratory tests, including those for SARS-CoV-2 infection (from Jan 1, 2018, to Jan 31, 2022). Details of vaccination status were provided by the Department of Health of the Hong Kong Government and were linked to data from the Hospital Authority with identity card numbers or passport numbers. Our outcomes were the overall incidence of any adverse event of special interest and the incidence rates of 30 adverse events of special interest, as suggested by the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, in the inpatient setting within 21 days (2 days for anaphylaxis) of either the first, second, or third CoronaVac dose compared with a baseline period. Individuals who had a history of a particular event between Jan 1, 2005, and Feb 23, 2021, were excluded from the corresponding analysis. We evaluated the risk of an adverse event of special interest using conditional Poisson regression, adjusting for seasonal effects.
Findings
Of 1 253 497 individuals who received at least one dose of CoronaVac during the study period, 622 317 (49·6%) were aged at least 60 years and were included in the analysis. Our analysis sample received 1 229 423 doses of CoronaVac and had a mean age of 70·40 years (SD 8·10). 293 086 (47·1%) of 622 317 participants were men and 329 231 (52·9%) were women. The incidence of individual adverse events of interest ranged from 0·00 per 100 000 people to 57·49 per 100 000 people (thromboembolism). The first and third doses of CoronaVac were not associated with a significant excess risk of an adverse event of special interest within 21 days (or 2 days for anaphylaxis) of vaccination. After the second dose, the only significantly increased risk was for anaphylaxis (adjusted incidence rate ratio 2·61, 95% CI 1·08–6·31; risk difference per 100 000 people 0·61, 95% CI 0·03–1·81).
Interpretation
Because older age is associated with poor outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the benefits of CoronaVac vaccination in older adults outweigh the risks in regions where COVID-19 is prevalent. Ongoing monitoring of vaccine safety is warranted.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 infection prevention measures can negatively impact nursing home residents’ well-being. Society has been concerned about the imbalance between infection prevention and residents’ well-being, and about nursing home residents’ autonomy in COVID-19 policymaking.
Objective
This study explores consensus among nursing home staff about which measures they found to be most important in contributing to preventing infections and to maintaining well-being of residents during COVID-19 outbreaks. In addition, this study explores the decision-making processes regarding COVID-19 measures and the involvement of residents or their representatives.
Design
Mixed methods based on an online nominal group technique.
Setting(s)
Dutch nursing homes, June–November 2020.
Participants
Managers, policy advisors, elderly care physicians, psychologists, a spiritual counselor, nurses, care assistants, and resident representatives (N = 35).
Methods
Four panels from the viewpoint of infection prevention, and four panels from the viewpoint of well-being were performed with 3 to 7 participants per panel. Participants individually selected the measure they found most important, discussed these measures together in an online conversation, and rated the importance and urgency of these measures during COVID-19 outbreaks on a 5-point Likert scale. The measures that were rated as (very) important and (very) urgent by all members of that panel were defined as ‘prioritized in consensus’. Panels also discussed the decision-making process regarding COVID-19 measures and the involvement of residents or their representatives. These conversations were transcribed verbatim and thematically coded using an inductive approach.
Results
The infection prevention panels prioritized isolation measures; testing measures; testing and isolation combinations; use of personal protective equipment around (suspected) infected residents; and preparation for outbreaks by COVID-19 outbreak teams. The well-being panels prioritized cohort isolation, testing combined with cohort isolation and with isolation in residents’ rooms, exceptions to visitor bans, maximum numbers of visitors, and registration and accompanying visitors to the residents’ rooms. Resident representatives and staff were dissatisfied with their reduced involvement in policy making during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, although they understood that decisions had to be made quickly.
Conclusions
Staff and resident representatives should be involved in COVID-19 policy making. According to them, priority COVID-19 measures should include: cohort isolation, testing and isolation combinations, use of personal protective equipment, crisis management by COVID-19 outbreak teams, and nursing home visit regulations and instruction of visitors. Combining these measures may be a first step towards packages of COVID-19 measures that better balance infection prevention and maintaining residents’ well-being.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a devastating and disproportionate impact on the elderly population. As the virus has swept through the world, already vulnerable elderly populations worldwide have faced a far greater burden of deaths and severe disease, crippling isolation, widespread societal stigma, and wide-ranging practical difficulties in maintaining access to basic health care and social services – all of which have had significant detrimental effects on their mental and physical wellbeing. In this paper, we present an overview of aging and COVID-19 from the interrelated perspectives of underlying biological mechanisms, physical manifestations, societal aspects, and health services related to the excess risk observed among the elderly population. We conclude that to tackle future pandemics in an efficient manner, it is essential to reform national health systems and response strategies from an age perspective. As the global population continues to age, elderly-focused health services should be integrated into the global health systems and global strategies, especially in low- and middle-income countries with historically underfunded public health infrastructure and insufficient gerontological care.

AB  - Contrary to the long-held belief that the effects of vaccines are specific for the disease they were created; compelling evidence has demonstrated that vaccines can exert positive or deleterious non-specific effects (NSEs). In this review, we compiled research reports from the last 40 years, which were found based on the PubMed search for the epidemiological and immunological studies on the non-specific effects (NSEs) of the most common human vaccines. Analysis of information showed that live vaccines induce positive NSEs, whereas non-live vaccines induce several negative NSEs, including increased female mortality associated with enhanced susceptibility to other infectious diseases, especially in developing countries. These negative NSEs are determined by the vaccination sequence, the antigen concentration in vaccines, the type of vaccine used (live vs. non-live), and also by repeated vaccination. We do not recommend stopping using non-live vaccines, as they have demonstrated to protect against their target disease, so the suggestion is that their detrimental NSEs can be minimized simply by changing the current vaccination sequence. High IgG4 antibody levels generated in response to repeated inoculation with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could be associated with a higher mortality rate from unrelated diseases and infections by suppressing the immune system. Since most COVID-19 vaccinated countries are reporting high percentages of excess mortality not directly attributable to deaths from such disease, the NSEs of mRNA vaccines on overall mortality should be studied in depth.

AB  - Background
The number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases was expected to increase during the Tokyo Olympic Games because of the increased physical contact within and between the domestic population and international participants of the Games. The rapid rise of the Delta variant (B.1.617) in Japan meant that hosting the Olympic Games without any restrictions was likely to lead to an increase in cases. We aimed to quantitatively assess possible COVID-19 response strategies for the Olympic Games, comparing the prevalence of severe cases and the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths via scenario analysis.
Methods
We used a discrete-time deterministic compartmental model structured by age group. Parameters were calibrated using the age-stratified COVID-19 incidence data in Osaka. Numerical simulations incorporated the planned Olympics Games and nationwide COVID-19 vaccination into the proposed model, alongside various subjects and types of countermeasures.
Results
Our model-informed approach suggested that having spectators at the Tokyo Olympic Games could lead to a surge in both cases and hospitalization. Projections for the scenario that explicitly incorporated the spread of the Delta variant (i.e., time-dependent increase in the relative transmissibility) showed that imposing stringent social distancing measures (Rt=0.7) for more than 8 weeks from the end of the Olympic Games might be required to suppress the prevalence of severe cases of COVID-19 to avoid overwhelming the intensive care unit capacity in Tokyo.
Conclusions
Our modeling analyses guided an optimal choice of COVID-19 response during and after the Tokyo Olympic Games, allowing the epidemic to be brought under control despite such a large mass gathering.

AB  - According to United Nations, World Tourism Organization COVID-19 has had the most devastating impact on the entire global tourism value chain, which resulted in a 74% decline in international passenger arrival, a US$1.3 trillion loss in international tourism receipts, over the US $ 2trillion loss of global domestic product and placing between 100 and 120 million jobs at risk globally. While the initial impact of the pandemic was uniform across the world, the recovery was expected to be varied across the region due to inequitable access to the COVID-19 vaccine. This study seeks to examine the implications of vaccination inequity on tourism recovery in the global tourism market. The study uses secondary, archival data and harnesses the advantages of big data generated from online activities from tourists and tourism companies obtained from authoritative sources. The study found that inequitable access to vaccinations produced a skewed recovery favouring vaccinated regions concentrated in the developed world, leaving poor regions such as Africa behind. The robot system characterising the vaccine-induced recovery had also created a vaccine diplomatic nightmare that scuttled global tourism recovery efforts. To ensure sustainable recovery, there is a need to ensure global vaccination access by rechannelling some of the excess vaccines in developed countries to countries that needs them to ensure the opening up of the entire tourism global market and reduce vulnerabilities that are coming from COVID-19 variants, which poses a threat to the gains made from the current vaccination program. The study concludes that there will not be any meaningful economic recovery without a wholesale approach covering the entire global population.

AB  - We look at some of the important topics of relevance by late 2021, for the mitigation and control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Overall, mathematical models have been a very useful tool for the efficient management of the epidemic. We review some of the main conclusions derived from their use in some of the important factors related to the evolution of the epidemic such as nonpharmaceutical interventions, vaccination rates and coverage, evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants, and their impact on the control of the epidemic. We also provide some recent results on the analysis of the epidemic in Mexico, as an example of its evolution in a country with high mortality, low testing, low contact tracing, and weak enforcing of NPI.

AB  - Global debates about vaccines as a key element of pandemic response and future preparedness in the era of Covid-19 currently focus on questions of supply, with attention to global injustice in vaccine distribution and African countries as rightful beneficiaries of international de-regulation and financing initiatives such as COVAX. At the same time, vaccine demand and uptake are seen to be threatened by hesitancy, often attributed to an increasingly globalised anti-vaxx movement and its propagation of misinformation and conspiracy, now reaching African populations through a social media ‘infodemic’. Underplayed in these debates are the socio-political contexts through which vaccine technologies enter and are interpreted within African settings, and the crucial intersections between supply and demand. We explore these through a ‘vaccine anxieties’ framework attending to both desires for and worries about vaccines, as shaped by bodily, societal and wider political understandings and experiences. This provides an analytical lens to organise and interpret ethnographic and narrative accounts in local and national settings in Uganda and Sierra Leone, and their (dis)connections with global debates and geopolitics. In considering the socially-embedded reasons why people want or do not want Covid-19 vaccines, and how this intersects with the dynamics of vaccine supply, access and distribution in rapidly-unfolding epidemic situations, we bring new, expanded insights into debates about vaccine confidence and vaccine preparedness.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has devastated mankind. To date, no approved treatment is available to completely combat this disease. Although many studies reported the potential of silver nanoparticles’ (AgNPs) action mechanism and effect against SARS-CoV-2, this is the first clinical trial that aimed to prove this effect. This open-label, randomized, parallel-group, investigator-initiated study (IIS) was conducted in India from 2021 to 2022 and included 40 patients diagnosed with moderately-severe to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This study proved a significantly higher survival rates (p < 0.05) and significantly lower number of days until supplemental oxygenation was required (p < 0.0001) for patients receiving intravenous AgNPs in form of AgSept® in addition to the standard COVID-19 treatment. This study highlights the importance of intravenous AgNPs administration in the treatment of virus-induced pneumonia.
