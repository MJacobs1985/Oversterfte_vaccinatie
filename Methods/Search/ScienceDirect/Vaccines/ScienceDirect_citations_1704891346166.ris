AB  - A large number of studies have examined individual-level factors that increase COVID-19 fatalities. However, no research has focused on the geodemographic classification of the most susceptible communities to COVID-19. In this cross-sectional ecological study, we used local fuzzy geographically-weighted clustering to create the socioeconomic profile of the US counties in relation to COVID-19 death rates. We demonstrate that living in a county which has households with lower income, people with a lack of health insurance, a high African-American percentage, and lower education level, lead to 27.12% higher COVID-19 death rates than the national median, and 72.56% higher compared to the least vulnerable counties. Compared to counties with a high COVID-19 death rate, counties with a low COVID-19 death rate have 44.90% higher annual median household income and nearly double house worth (89.51% more). Results show that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not universal and that the minoritised and impoverished populations suffer more. Our analysis can effectively pinpoint the most vulnerable counties and importantly allows for understanding the socioeconomic context in which tailored interventions can be applied to mitigate COVID-19 deaths.

AB  - The recently prevalent variants of concerns (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2 belong to Omicron variants which display increased transmissibility and evade from immune protection generated by vaccines and/or natural infections. Better immunization strategies should be explored to induce broader immune responses against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we used inactivated vaccines derived from ancestral (Wu), Delta (Del) and Omicron (Omi) strains to immunize mice with homologous booster (3 × Wu, 3 × Del and 3 × Omi) or heterologous sequential booster (Wu/Del/Omi and Omi/Wu/Del) to evaluate their responses against two pre-Omicron (Wu and Del) and four Omicron variants. Even though neutralization responses against Wu and Del variants were similar in heterologous and homologous immunization groups, heterologous immunization groups induced significantly stronger neutralizing antibody against BA.1 (4.1–11 folds higher) and BA.2 (4.7–14.2 folds higher) than those of homologous immunization groups. While homologous immunization only induced strong neutralizing responses to either pre-Omicron variants (Wu and Del) in 3 × Wu and 3 × Del groups or to Omicron variants (BA.1 and BA.2) in 3 × Omi group, heterologous immunization groups induced strong and broader neutralizing responses to both pre-Omicron (Wu, Del) and Omicron variants (BA.1 and BA.2). Homologous and heterologous immunization groups elicited similar antigen-specific T cell (IFN-γ+) and B cell responses. Compared with homologous immunization, heterologous immunization could induce stronger plasma cell responses, which have the potential to generate broader and stronger neutralizing antibodies. However, neither heterologous nor homologous immunization groups induced strong neutralizing antibody against variants with bigger genetic deviation, such as BA.4/5 or BF.7, only weak neutralizing responses were induced. Surveillance on SARS-CoV2 variants evolution and immunization strategy are needed to explore better vaccines with broader and stronger neutralizing antibodies against post pandemic COVID-19.

AB  - We estimate the economic impacts of COVID-19 in the U.S. using a disaster economic consequence analysis framework implemented by a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. This facilitates identification of relative influences of several causal factors as “shocks” to the model, including mandatory business closures, disease spread trajectories, behavioral responses, resilience, pent-up demand, and government stimulus packages. The analysis is grounded in primary data on avoidance behavior and healthcare parameters. The decomposition of the influence of various causal factors will help policymakers offset the negative influences and reinforce the positive ones during the remainder of this pandemic and future ones.

AB  - Recently, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has attracted the attention of scientists where it has a high mortality rate among older adults and individuals suffering from chronic diseases, such as chronic kidney diseases (CKD). It is important to elucidate molecular mechanisms by which COVID-19 affects the kidneys and accordingly develop proper nutritional and pharmacological strategies. Although numerous studies have recently recommended several approaches for the management of COVID-19 in CKD, its impact on patients with renal diseases remains the biggest challenge worldwide. In this paper, we review the most recent evidence regarding causality, potential nutritional supplements, therapeutic options, and management of COVID-19 infection in vulnerable individuals and patients with CKD. To date, there is no effective treatment for COVID-19-induced kidney dysfunction, and current treatments are yet limited to anti-inflammatory (e.g. ibuprofen) and anti-viral medications (e.g. Remdesivir, and Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine) that may increase the chance of treatment. In conclusion, the knowledge about kidney damage in COVID-19 is very limited, and this review improves our ability to introduce novel approaches for future clinical trials for this contiguous disease.

AB  - Summary
Background
Low-dose corticosteroids have been shown to reduce mortality for patients with COVID-19 requiring oxygen or ventilatory support (non-invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). We evaluated the use of a higher dose of corticosteroids in this patient group.
Methods
This randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]) is assessing multiple possible treatments in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Eligible and consenting adult patients with clinical evidence of hypoxia (ie, receiving oxygen or with oxygen saturation <92% on room air) were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual care with higher dose corticosteroids (dexamethasone 20 mg once daily for 5 days followed by 10 mg dexamethasone once daily for 5 days or until discharge if sooner) or usual standard of care alone (which included dexamethasone 6 mg once daily for 10 days or until discharge if sooner). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality among all randomised participants. On May 11, 2022, the independent data monitoring committee recommended stopping recruitment of patients receiving no oxygen or simple oxygen only due to safety concerns. We report the results for these participants only. Recruitment of patients receiving ventilatory support is ongoing. The RECOVERY trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04381936).
Findings
Between May 25, 2021, and May 13, 2022, 1272 patients with COVID-19 and hypoxia receiving no oxygen (eight [1%]) or simple oxygen only (1264 [99%]) were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus higher dose corticosteroids (659 patients) versus usual care alone (613 patients, of whom 87% received low-dose corticosteroids during the follow-up period). Of those randomly assigned, 745 (59%) were in Asia, 512 (40%) in the UK, and 15 (1%) in Africa. 248 (19%) had diabetes and 769 (60%) were male. Overall, 123 (19%) of 659 patients allocated to higher dose corticosteroids versus 75 (12%) of 613 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 1·59 [95% CI 1·20–2·10]; p=0·0012). There was also an excess of pneumonia reported to be due to non-COVID infection (64 cases [10%] vs 37 cases [6%]; absolute difference 3·7% [95% CI 0·7–6·6]) and an increase in hyperglycaemia requiring increased insulin dose (142 [22%] vs 87 [14%]; absolute difference 7·4% [95% CI 3·2–11·5]).
Interpretation
In patients hospitalised for COVID-19 with clinical hypoxia who required either no oxygen or simple oxygen only, higher dose corticosteroids significantly increased the risk of death compared with usual care, which included low-dose corticosteroids. The RECOVERY trial continues to assess the effects of higher dose corticosteroids in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 who require non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

AB  - Background
The availability of a COVID-19 vaccine has been heralded as key to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 vaccination programme success will rely on public willingness to be vaccinated.
Methods
We used a multi-methods approach - involving an online cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews - to investigate parents’ and guardians’ views on the acceptability of a future COVID-19 vaccine. 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16 + years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey participants were interviewed.
Findings
Most survey participants reported they would likely accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (Definitely 55.8%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 34.3%) and their child/children (Definitely 48.2%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 40.9%). Less than 4% of survey participants reported that they would definitely not accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Survey participants were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves than their child/children. Participants that self-reported as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity were almost 3 times more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children than White British, White Irish and White Other participants. Survey participants from lower-income households were also more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine. In open-text survey responses and interviews, self-protection from COVID-19 was reported as the main reason for vaccine acceptance. Common concerns identified in open-text responses and interviews were around COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, mostly prompted by the newness and rapid development of the vaccine.
Conclusion
Information on how COVID-19 vaccines are developed and tested, including their safety and efficacy, must be communicated clearly to the public. To prevent inequalities in uptake, it is crucial to understand and address factors that may affect COVID-19 vaccine acceptability in ethnic minority and lower-income groups who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 pandemic has affected routine immunization globally. Impact will likely be higher in low and middle-income countries with limited healthcare resources and fragile health systems. We quantified the impact, spatial heterogeneity, and determinants for childhood immunizations of 48 million population affected in the Sindh province of Pakistan.
Methods
We extracted individual immunization records from real-time provincial Electronic Immunization Registry from September 23, 2019, to July 11, 2020. Comparing baseline (6 months preceding the lockdown) and the COVID-19 lockdown period, we analyzed the impact on daily immunization coverage rate for each antigen by geographical area. We used multivariable logistic regression to explore the predictors associated with immunizations during the lockdown.
Results
There was a 52.5% decline in the daily average total number of vaccinations administered during lockdown compared to baseline. The highest decline was seen for Bacille Cal­mette Guérin (BCG) (40.6% (958/2360) immunization at fixed sites. Around 8438 children/day were missing immunization during the lockdown. Enrollments declined furthest in rural districts, urban sub-districts with large slums, and polio-endemic super high-risk sub-districts. Pentavalent-3 (penta-3) immunization rates were higher in infants born in hospitals (RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.04–1.15) and those with mothers having higher education (RR: 1.19–1.50; 95% CI: 1.13–1.65). Likelihood of penta-3 immunization was reduced by 5% for each week of delayed enrollment into the immunization program.
Conclusion
One out of every two children in Sindh province has missed their routine vaccinations during the provincial COVID-19 lockdown. The pool of un-immunized children is expanding during lockdown, leaving them susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases. There is a need for tailored interventions to promote immunization visits and safe service delivery. Higher maternal education, facility-based births, and early enrollment into the immunization program continue to show a positive association with immunization uptake, even during a challenging lockdown.

AB  - Physical distancing and contact tracing are two key components in controlling the COVID-19 epidemics. Understanding their interaction at local level is important for policymakers. We propose a flexible modeling framework to assess the effect of combining contact tracing with different physical distancing strategies. Using scenario tree analyses, we compute the probability of COVID-19 detection using passive surveillance, with and without contact tracing, in metropolitan Barcelona. The estimates of detection probability and the frequency of daily social contacts are fitted into an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered compartmental model to simulate the epidemics considering different physical distancing scenarios over a period of 26 weeks. With the original Wuhan strain, the probability of detecting an infected individual without implementing physical distancing would have been 0.465, 0.515, 0.617, and 0.665 in designated age groups (0–14, 15–49, 50–64, and >65), respectively. As the physical distancing measures were reinforced and the disease circulation decreased, the interaction between the two interventions resulted in a reduction of the detection probabilities; however, despite this reduction, active contact tracing and isolation remained an effective supplement to physical distancing. If we relied solely on passive surveillance for diagnosing COVID-19, the model required a minimal 50% (95% credible interval, 39–69%) reduction of daily social contacts to keep the infected population under 5%, as compared to the 36% (95% credible interval, 22–56%) reduction with contact tracing systems. The simulation with the B.1.1.7 and B.1.167.2 strains shows similar results. Our simulations showed that a functioning contact tracing program would reduce the need for physical distancing and mitigate the COVID-19 epidemics.

AB  - Summary
Background
Venous thromboembolism is a major complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We hypothesized that a weight-adjusted intermediate dose of anticoagulation may decrease the risk of venous thromboembolism COVID-19 patients.
Methods
In this multicenter, randomised, open-label, phase 4, superiority trial with blinded adjudication of outcomes, we randomly assigned adult patients hospitalised in 20 French centers and presenting with acute respiratory SARS-CoV-2. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive an intermediate weight-adjusted prophylactic dose or a fixed-dose of subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin during the hospital stay. The primary outcome corresponded to symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis (fatal) pulmonary embolism during hospitalization (COVI-DOSE ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04373707).
Findings
Between May 2020, and April 2021, 1000 patients underwent randomisation in medical wards (noncritically ill) (80.1%) and intensive care units (critically ill) (19.9%); 502 patients were assigned to receive a weight-adjusted intermediate dose, and 498 received fixed-dose thromboprophylaxis. Symptomatic venous thromboembolism occurred in 6 of 502 patients (1.2%) in the weight-adjusted dose group and in 10 of 498 patients (2.1%) in the fixed-dose group (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.22–1.63; P = 0.31). There was a twofold increased risk of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding: 5.9% in the weight-adjusted dose group and 3.1% in the fixed-dose group (P = 0.034).
Interpretation
In the COVI-DOSE trial, the observed rate of thromboembolic events was lower than expected in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, and the study was unable to show a significant difference in the risk of venous thromboembolism between the two low-molecular-weight-heparin regimens.

AB  - Initial measures to control the outbreak of COVID-19 seemed to be insufficient due to the lack of preparedness for this unexpected pandemic of the 21st century. A key aspect of pandemic preparedness is understanding the population-level differences. In this chapter, we discussed the role of population-level differences in the prevalence, severity, and clinical outcome of COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was found that the disease has affected different populations disproportionately. For instance, usually, the prevalence was found to be more in Southern Asia and African regions as compared to the Western pacific. Furthermore, the infected proportion of the male population was higher than that of females. On the basis of race, the prevalence in the black population was higher than in the white. Population-based severity and clinical outcomes based on age, sex, genetic and socioeconomic status in COVID-19 also demand effective and focused measures to control the pandemic situations.

AB  - Inflammation is an established driver of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and a mechanism linked to the increased susceptibility to fatal COVID-19 demonstrated by patients with cancer. As patients with cancer exhibit a higher level of inflammation compared with the general patient population, patients with cancer and COVID-19 may uniquely benefit from strategies targeted at overcoming the unrestrained pro-inflammatory response. Targeted and non-targeted anti-inflammatory therapies may prevent end-organ damage in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer and decrease mortality. Here, we review the clinical role of selective inhibition of pro-inflammatory interleukins, tyrosine kinase modulation, anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, and other non-targeted approaches including corticosteroids in their roles as disease-modulating agents in patients with COVID-19 and cancer. Investigation of these therapeutics in this highly vulnerable patient group is posited to facilitate the development of tailored therapeutics for this patient population, aiding the transition of systemic inflammation from a prognostic domain to a source of therapeutic targets.

AB  - Objective
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted mental health worldwide, and suicide can be a serious outcome of this. Thus, suicide characteristics were examined before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico City.
Methods
This is a retrospective study including all Mexico City residents who had a coroner's record with a cause of death of intentional self-harm (ICD-10) from January 2016 to December 2021.
Results
From 2016 to 2021, 3636 people committed suicide, of which 2869 were males (78.9%) and 767 females (21.1%). From 2016 to 2019 the suicide rate remained constant (∼6 per 100000) and dramatically increased in 2020 (10.45 per 100,000), to return to the levels of the previous year in 2021 (6.95 per 100000). The suicide rate in 2020 specifically increased from January to June (COVID-19 outbreak) in all age groups. Moreover, every year young people (15–24 years) have the maximum suicide rate and depression was the main suicide etiology.
Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak increased the suicide rate, regardless of age, but suicide prevalence was higher in males and young people, regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings confirm that suicide is a complex and multifactorial problem and will allow the establishment of new guidelines for prevention and care strategies.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide, and while the mortality rate remains the primary concern, it is becoming increasingly apparent that many COVID-19 survivors experience long-term sequelae, representing a major concern for both themselves and healthcare providers. Comparing long-term sequelae following COVID-19 to those of other respiratory viruses such as influenza, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1 is an essential step toward understanding the extent and impact of these sequelae. A literature search was carried out using the PubMed. database. Search-terms included “persistent”, “long-term”, “chronic”, and MeSH-terms for SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and Influenza. Only English-language articles were selected. Articles were screened by title/abstract and full-text readings. Key points for comparison were persistent symptoms > 4 weeks, virus type, study design, population size, admission status, methods, and findings. Thirty-one articles were included: 19 on SARS-CoV-1, 10 on influenza, and 2 on MERS-CoV-survivors. Damage to the respiratory system was the main long-term manifestation after the acute phase of infection. Quality of life-related and psychological sequelae were the second and third most widely reported symptoms, respectively. Consistent with long-term sequelae from COVID-19, persisting cardiovascular, neurological, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal impairments were also reported. In summary, the long-term sequelae following COVID-19 are a significant concern, and while long-term sequelae following influenza, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1 have also been reported, their prevalence and severity are less clear. It is essential to continue to study and monitor the long-term effects of all respiratory viruses so as to improve our understanding and develop strategies for prevention and treatment.

AB  - Shelter-in-place mandates and closure of nonessential businesses have been central to COVID19 response strategies including in Toronto, Canada. Approximately half of the working population in Canada are employed in occupations that do not allow for remote work suggesting potentially limited impact of some of the strategies proposed to mitigate COVID-19 acquisition and onward transmission risks and associated morbidity and mortality. We compared per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 23, 2020 to January 24, 2021, across neighborhoods in Toronto by proportion of the population working in essential services. We used person-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 community cases and deaths, and census data for neighborhood-level attributes. Cumulative per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths were 3.3-fold and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, in neighborhoods with the highest versus lowest concentration of essential workers. Findings suggest that the population who continued to serve the essential needs of society throughout COVID-19 shouldered a disproportionate burden of transmission and deaths. Taken together, results signal the need for active intervention strategies to complement restrictive measures to optimize both the equity and effectiveness of COVID-19 responses.

AB  - Summary
Background and aims
Body mass index (BMI) has previously been shown to increase mortality and disease severity in patients with COVID-19, but the pooled effect estimate was heterogeneous. Although BMI is widely used as an indicator, it cannot distinguish visceral from subcutaneous fat. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between visceral adiposity, subcutaneous fat, and severe COVID-19.
Methods
We performed a systematic literature search using the databases: PubMed, Embase, and EuropePMC. Data on visceral fat area (VTA), subcutaneous fat area (SFA), and total fat area (TFA) were collected. The outcome of interest was severe COVID-19. We used a REML random-effects model to pool the mean differences and odds ratio (OR).
Results
There were 5 studies comprising of 539 patients. Patients with severe COVID-19 have a higher VTA (mean difference 41.7 cm2 [27.0, 56.4], p < 0.001; I2: 0%) and TFA (mean difference 64.6 cm2 [26.2, 103.1], p = 0.001; I2: 0%). There was no significant difference in terms of SFA between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 (mean difference 9.3 cm2 [-4.9, 23.4], p = 0.199; I2: 1.2%). Pooled ORs showed that VTA was associated with severe COVID-19 (OR 1.9 [1.1, 2.2], p = 0.002; I2: 49.3%).
Conclusion
Visceral adiposity was associated with increased COVID-19 severity, while subcutaneous adiposity was not.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly pathogenic and transmissible virus. Infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 known as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be severe, especially among high risk populations affected of underlying medical conditions. COVID-19 is characterized by the severe acute respiratory syndrome, a hyper inflammatory syndrome, vascular injury, microangiopathy and thrombosis. Antiviral drugs and immune modulating methods has been evaluated. So far, a particular therapeutic option has not been approved for COVID-19 and a variety of treatments have been studied for COVID-19 including, current treatment such as oxygen therapy, corticosteroids, antiviral agents until targeted therapy and vaccines which are diverse in each patient and have various outcomes. According to the findings of different in vitro and in vivo studies, some novel approach such as gene editing, cell based therapy, and immunotherapy may have significant potential in the treatment of COVID-19. Based on these findings, this paper aims to review the different strategies of treatment against COVID-19 and provide a summary from traditional and newer methods in curing COVID-19.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated the importance of implementing strategic management that prioritizes the safety of frontline nurse professionals. In this sense, this research was aimed at identifying factors associated with the illness of nursing professionals caused by COVID-19 according to socio-demographic, clinical, and labor variables.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in three Brazilian university hospitals with 859 nursing professionals, which include nurses, technicians, and nursing assistants, between November 2020 and February 2021. We present data using absolute and relative frequency. We used Chi-square test for hypothesis testing and multiple logistic regression for predictive analysis and chances of occurrence.
Results
The rate of nursing professionals affected by COVID-19 was 41.8%, and the factors associated with contamination were the number of people in the same household with COVID-19 and obesity. Being a nurse was a protective factor when the entire nursing team was considered. The model is significant, and its variables represent 56.61% of the occurrence of COVID-19 in nursing professionals.
Conclusion
Obesity and living in the same household as other people affected by COVID-19 increases the risk of contamination by this new coronavirus.

AB  - A key issue for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is whether non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions (NPIs) retard death rates. Good information about causal effects from NPIs comes from flu-related excess deaths in large U.S. cities during the second wave of the Great Influenza Pandemic, September 1918-February 1919. The measured NPIs are in three categories: school closings, prohibitions of public gatherings, and quarantine/isolation. Although an increase in NPIs flattened the curve in the sense of reducing the ratio of peak to overall flu-related excess death rates, the estimated effect on overall deaths is small and statistically insignificant. These findings differ from those associated with COVID-19 in the sense that facemask mandates and usage seem to reduce COVID-related cases.

AB  - Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented changes in care delivery across the pregnancy care continuum. Our primary objective with this research was to characterize the range of ways that the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic affected pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care experiences.
Methods
Pregnant and recently pregnant patients (n = 20) from obstetrics and gynecology clinical sites associated with Massachusetts General Hospital were interviewed about their experiences with prenatal care, childbirth, and postpartum care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interview transcripts were analyzed for emergent themes.
Results
This sample included 20 pregnant and postpartum people, including 11 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy or postpartum and nine with suspected infection. The ways in which COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19 affected experiences of prenatal care, childbirth, and postpartum care were complex and varied. Three themes were identified across narratives of pregnancy, birth, and postpartum care: patient perceptions of diminished access to care, stigma due to COVID-19 infection, and limited capacity of providers to honor patient preferences.
Conclusions
A better understanding of pregnant and recently pregnant people's experiences during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic can inform infection control policies and clinical care delivery practices that are more congruent with the needs and values of pregnant, birthing, and postpartum people as institutions craft responses to future pandemics. Approaches that maximize meaningful access across the pregnancy care continuum, center patients' priorities within adapted care models, and honor patient preferences as much as possible are important aspects of an appropriate response to future waves of COVID-19 and other pandemics.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections present with increased disease severity and poor clinical outcomes in diabetic patients compared with their nondiabetic counterparts. Diabetes/hyperglycemia-triggered endothelial dysfunction and hyperactive inflammatory and immune responses are correlated to twofold to threefold higher intensive care hospitalizations and more than twice the mortality among diabetic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. While comorbidities such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension worsen the prognosis of diabetic COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 infections are also associated with new-onset diabetes, severe metabolic complications, and increased thrombotic events in the backdrop of aberrant endothelial function. While several antidiabetic medications are used to manage blood glucose levels, we discuss the multifaceted ability of metformin to control blood glucose levels and possibly attenuate endothelial dysfunction, inhibit viral entry and infection, and modify inflammatory and immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infections. These actions make metformin a viable candidate drug to be considered for repurposing and gaining ground against the SARS-CoV-2-induced tsunami in diabetic COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Summary
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic arrived at a time of faltering global poverty reduction and increasing levels of diet-related diseases, both of which have a strong link to poor outcomes for those with COVID-19. Governments responded to the pandemic by placing unprecedented restrictions on internal and external movements, which have resulted in an economic contraction. In response to the economic shock, G20 governments have committed to providing US$14 trillion stimuli to support economic recovery. We aimed to assess the impact of different COVID-19 recovery paths on human health, environmental sustainability, and food sustainability.
Methods
We used LandSyMM, a global gridded land use change model, to analyse the impact of recovery paths from COVID-19. The paths were illustrated by four scenarios that represent different pandemic severities (including a single or recurrent pandemic) and alternate modes of recovery, including a transition of food demand towards healthier diets that result in changes to the food system: (1) solidarity and celery, (2) nothing new, (3) fries and fragmentation, and (4) best laid plans. For each scenario, we modelled the economic shocks of the pandemic and the impact of policy measures to promote healthier diets in the years after the COVID-19 pandemic, including the supply of and demand for food, environmental outcomes, and human health outcomes. The four scenarios use established future population growth and economic development projections derived from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 2. We quantified the outcomes from more societally cooperative pandemic responses that result in reduced trade barriers and improved technological development against less cooperative responses.
Findings
Repeated pandemic shocks (the fries and fragmentation and best laid plans scenarios) reduce the ability of the lowest income countries to ensure food security. A post-pandemic recovery that includes dietary transition towards the consumption of less meat and more fruits and vegetables (the solidarity and celery scenario) could prevent 2583 premature deaths per million in 2060, whereas recovery paths that are focused on economic recovery (the fries and fragmentation scenario) could trigger an additional 778 deaths per million in 2060. The transition of dietary preferences towards healthier diets (the solidarity and celery scenario) also reduces nitrogen fertiliser use by 40 million tonnes and irrigation water by 400 km3 compared with no dietary change in 2060 (the nothing new scenario). Finally, the scenario with dietary transition increases the affordability of the average diet.
Interpretation
The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is most visible in low-income countries, where a reduction in growth projections makes a greater difference to the affordability of a basic diet. A change in dietary preferences is most impactful in reducing mortality and the burden of disease when income levels are high. At lower income, a transition towards lower meat consumption reduces undernourishment and diet-related mortality.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic 2nd wave catastrophic effect in the state of Chhattisgarh, India, from where no exclusive genomic data yet published, has prompted us to undertake this study to unearth the causative variant. Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from COVID-19 infected nine vaccinated healthcare workers (HCW), thirty mild/moderate, seventeen severe, and twenty-seven deceased patients, was performed. The significant predominance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC), Delta (lineage B.1.617.2) identified in sixty-four (77.1%) cases in contrast to B.1 and its sublineage in eleven (13.2%), variant under monitoring (VUM), Kappa (lineage B.1.617.1) in five (6.0%) and another VOC Alpha (lineage B.1.1.7) in three (3.6%) cases respectively (p < 0.05, χ2 = 162.49). 88.8% vaccine breakthrough, 60% mild/moderate, 94.4% severe and 81.5% dead patients were infected by Delta. Kappa presents exclusively in mild/moderate, Alpha in vaccine breakthrough, mild/moderate, and dead patient and B.1 and its sublineages in mild, severe, and dead patient categories. Delta variant spike mutation of T19R, G142D, E156G, L452R, and deletion (F157 and R158) helps in escaping antibody response, T478K and D614G enhance viral affinity with ACE2 receptor while P681R and D950N result in higher replication and transmissibility by cleaving S1/S2 at furin site. We conclude that Delta variant predominant role along with co-occurrence of Kappa, Alpha, and B.1 variant during COVID-19 2nd wave pandemic in Chhattisgarh may pose a potential threat of future outbreak through hybrid variant evolution. Thus, intensive genomic surveillance for monitoring variant evolution and a more efficacious vaccine against the Delta and Alpha variants are required.

AB  - Background
In March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, and Tunisia implemented a containment and targeted screening strategy. The country's public health policy has since focused on managing hospital beds.
Methods
The study analyzed the bed occupancy rates in public hospitals in Tunisia during the pandemic. The evolution of daily cases and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) actions undertaken by the Tunisian Government were also analyzed. The study used 3 indices to assess bed flexibility: Ramp duration until the peak, ramp growth until the peak, and ramp rate until the peak. The study also calculated the time shift at the start and peak of each wave to evaluate the government's response efficacy.
Results
The study found that the evolution of the epidemic in Tunisia had 2 phases. The first phase saw the pandemic being controlled due to strong NPI actions, while the second phase saw a relaxation of measures and an increase in wave intensity. ICU bed availability followed the demand for beds, but ICU bed occupancy remained high, with a maximum of 97%. The government's response in terms of bed distribution and reallocation was slow. The study found that the most deadly wave by ICU occupied bed was the third wave due to a historical variant, while the fifth wave due to the delta variant was the most deadly in terms of cumulative death.
Conclusions
The study concluded that decision-makers could use its findings to assess their response capabilities in the current pandemic and future ones. The study highlighted the importance of flexible and responsive healthcare systems in managing pandemics.

AB  - This paper identifies robust determinants of US stock price movements in the economic shadow of the COVID-19 crisis and in the presence of model uncertainty, using several influential factors highlighted in relevant research. Our investigation performs an extreme bounds analysis (EBA), a global sensitivity framework capable of handling the problem of model uncertainty. We document that excess market returns, term spread, implied volatility, oil, Twitter-based economic uncertainty, and European and Chinese stock returns are the only variables that are robust to all possible variations in the condition set of information. The results also reveal the irrelevance of newly reported COVID-19 cases and deaths as novel drivers that contribute to the formation stock prices, thus lending support to the “psychophysical numbing” phenomenon.

AB  - Despite its universal nature, the impact of COVID-19 has not been geographically homogeneous. While certain countries and regions have been severely affected, registering record infection rates and excess deaths, others experienced only milder outbreaks. We investigate to what extent human factors, in particular cultural origins reflected in different attitudes and behavioural norms, can explain different degrees of exposure to the virus. Motivated by the linguistic relativity hypothesis, we take language as a proxy for cultural origins and exploit the exogenous variation in the language spoken around the border that divides the French- and German-speaking parts of Switzerland to estimate the impact of culture on exposure to COVID-19. The results obtained using a spatial regression discontinuity design reveal, that within 50- and 25- kilometres bandwidth from the language border, the average COVID-19 exposure levels for individuals in French speaking municipalities was higher. In particular, we find that German speaking municipalities were associated with a reduction of around 40% - 50% in the odds of COVID-19 exposure compared to the French speaking municipalities.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on mental health symptoms and quality of life (QoL) in the general population due to necessary public health restrictions such as social distancing. The psychosocial effect of the pandemic on vulnerable groups such as people living with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) has been scarcely explored in countries with additional socioeconomical burdens such as access to healthcare disparities
Methods
A questionnaire exploring sociodemographic variables, quality of life, mental health determinants and sleep quality was applied to 92 PwMS to explore changes prior and during the pandemic regarding these domains
Results
58.8% of the subjects were female, median age was 37.1 (± 8.5) years and relapsing-remitting MS was the predominant clinical subtype (83.5%). Unemployment rate significantly increased during the pandemic (12.3% vs 27.8%; p= 0.001). Only 46.4% received medical follow-up care during the pandemic. QoL was affected predominantly due to limitations in instrumented activities of daily life (IADL). Neuropsychiatric symptoms, requiring healthcare during the pandemic, anxiety prior to the pandemic and restricted IADL were predictors of MS-related physical impact worsening, while decreased physical/emotional wellbeing selfcare, neuropsychiatric symptoms, bad sleep quality, anxiety prior to the pandemic and restricted non-instrumental ADL predicted aggravation of MS-related psychological impact measured by the MSIS-29. Curiously, specific items regarding anxiety were more prevalent prior to the pandemic (anxious mood; p=0.02, helplessness; p=0.01), sleep problems; p=0.001 and cardiovascular symptoms; p=0.001, nevertheless, stability was observed for most items. Importantly, 77.3% of PwMS reported at least one neuropsychiatric symptom
Conclusion
The deleterious effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychosocial wellbeing in PwMS, QoL and mental health outcomes are frequently overseen in vulnerable populations such as PwMS. Albeit the limitations of this study, our results may help implement policies that prevent negative outcomes on psychosocial wellbeing due to public health measures (e.g., social distancing) in MS and other neurological diseases that inexorably need constant follow-up.

AB  - Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Europe in March 2020 and created major challenges across healthcare provision and for healthcare education programmes as well as having a major impact on society. Within the profession of Radiography changes in medical imaging, radiotherapy, and teaching practices have been reported along with the negative impact on radiographers and students. The aim of this study was to investigate key challenges relating to academic practice during the COIVD-19 pandemic; how radiography academics have coped and to identify recommendations for further support required to facilitate recovery of the academic faculty as the pandemic ebbs.
Methods
A survey was circulated using SurveyMonkey™ via personal, national and international networks, including the European Federation of Radiographer Societies (EFRS), to reach as many academic radiographers as possible. Open questions relating to the challenges of providing radiography education during the COVID-19 pandemic and the and coping strategies used were included. Thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo (QSR International, MA).
Results
533 academic radiographers responded to the whole survey from 43 different countries, with 340 responses relating to challenges and 327 for coping strategies. The main themes for the challenges were clinical practice, communication with colleagues, lack of face to face, managing change, students (support), and staff support. The coping strategy themes were communication with colleagues, physical exercise, self-care and wellbeing.
Conclusion
These data demonstrate a multitude of challenges for academic radiographers and the pressure they worked under during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic was clear. However, the majority employed healthy coping strategies to help them deal with the pressure, uncertainty and trauma of the situation.
Implications for practice
COVID-19 had a significant impact on academic radiographers and while many reported good strategies for coping, the level of pressure is unsustainable. This study highlights the need to support academic radiographers to ensure a sustainable workforce.

AB  - In today's information age, both excess and lack of information can cause a disaster. COVID-19 pandemic not only highlighted the significance of risk communication but also pointed out several unintended and distressing consequences due to information gaps and miscommunications. Despite facing a common threat, the local communities suffered differential impacts during the pandemic. This paper classifies the nature of risk communications experienced across different countries into three categories, namely: inadequate, ideal, and infodemic risk communication that influenced the local perceptions and responses. It further argues that inadequately planned risk communications tend to create new risks and compromise the efforts towards managing a disaster. As global risks are responded locally, there is a need for more inclusive and engaging risk communication that involves communities as responsible stakeholders who understand, plan, and respond to risks to increase their propensity for resilience during disasters and crisis situations.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, causing considerable mortality and morbidity worldwide, has fully engaged the biomedical community in attempts to elucidate the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and develop robust therapeutic strategies. To this end, the predominant research focus has been on the adaptive immune response to COVID-19 infections stimulated by mRNA and protein vaccines and on the duration and persistence of immune protection. In contrast, the role of the innate immune response to the viral challenge has been underrepresented. This overview focuses on the innate immune response to COVID-19 infection, with an emphasis on the roles of extracellular proteases in the tissue microenvironment. Proteinase-mediated signaling caused by enzymes in the extracellular microenvironment occurs upstream of the increased production of inflammatory cytokines that mediate COVID-19 pathology. These enzymes include the coagulation cascade, kinin-generating plasma kallikrein, and the complement system, as well as angiotensin-generating proteinases of the renin–angiotensin system. Furthermore, in the context of several articles in this Supplement elucidating and detailing the trajectory of diverse profibrotic pathways, we extrapolate these insights to explore how fibrosis and profibrotic pathways participate importantly in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. We propose that the lessons garnered from understanding the roles of microenvironment proteinases in triggering the innate immune response to COVID-19 pathology will identify potential therapeutic targets and inform approaches to the clinical management of COVID-19. Furthermore, the information may also provide a template for understanding the determinants of COVID-19–induced tissue fibrosis that may follow resolution of acute infection (so-called “long COVID”), which represents a major new challenge to our healthcare systems.

AB  - Summary
Background
National rates of COVID-19 infection and fatality have varied dramatically since the onset of the pandemic. Understanding the conditions associated with this cross-country variation is essential to guiding investment in more effective preparedness and response for future pandemics.
Methods
Daily SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths for 177 countries and territories and 181 subnational locations were extracted from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's modelling database. Cumulative infection rate and infection-fatality ratio (IFR) were estimated and standardised for environmental, demographic, biological, and economic factors. For infections, we included factors associated with environmental seasonality (measured as the relative risk of pneumonia), population density, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, proportion of the population living below 100 m, and a proxy for previous exposure to other betacoronaviruses. For IFR, factors were age distribution of the population, mean body-mass index (BMI), exposure to air pollution, smoking rates, the proxy for previous exposure to other betacoronaviruses, population density, age-standardised prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer, and GDP per capita. These were standardised using indirect age standardisation and multivariate linear models. Standardised national cumulative infection rates and IFRs were tested for associations with 12 pandemic preparedness indices, seven health-care capacity indicators, and ten other demographic, social, and political conditions using linear regression. To investigate pathways by which important factors might affect infections with SARS-CoV-2, we also assessed the relationship between interpersonal and governmental trust and corruption and changes in mobility patterns and COVID-19 vaccination rates.
Findings
The factors that explained the most variation in cumulative rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection between Jan 1, 2020, and Sept 30, 2021, included the proportion of the population living below 100 m (5·4% [4·0–7·9] of variation), GDP per capita (4·2% [1·8–6·6] of variation), and the proportion of infections attributable to seasonality (2·1% [95% uncertainty interval 1·7–2·7] of variation). Most cross-country variation in cumulative infection rates could not be explained. The factors that explained the most variation in COVID-19 IFR over the same period were the age profile of the country (46·7% [18·4–67·6] of variation), GDP per capita (3·1% [0·3–8·6] of variation), and national mean BMI (1·1% [0·2–2·6] of variation). 44·4% (29·2–61·7) of cross-national variation in IFR could not be explained. Pandemic-preparedness indices, which aim to measure health security capacity, were not meaningfully associated with standardised infection rates or IFRs. Measures of trust in the government and interpersonal trust, as well as less government corruption, had larger, statistically significant associations with lower standardised infection rates. High levels of government and interpersonal trust, as well as less government corruption, were also associated with higher COVID-19 vaccine coverage among middle-income and high-income countries where vaccine availability was more widespread, and lower corruption was associated with greater reductions in mobility. If these modelled associations were to be causal, an increase in trust of governments such that all countries had societies that attained at least the amount of trust in government or interpersonal trust measured in Denmark, which is in the 75th percentile across these spectrums, might have reduced global infections by 12·9% (5·7–17·8) for government trust and 40·3% (24·3–51·4) for interpersonal trust. Similarly, if all countries had a national BMI equal to or less than that of the 25th percentile, our analysis suggests global standardised IFR would be reduced by 11·1%.
Interpretation
Efforts to improve pandemic preparedness and response for the next pandemic might benefit from greater investment in risk communication and community engagement strategies to boost the confidence that individuals have in public health guidance. Our results suggest that increasing health promotion for key modifiable risks is associated with a reduction of fatalities in such a scenario.

AB  - Objectives
The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic declared by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 impacted healthcare services with provider and patient cancellations, delays, and patient avoidance or delay of emergency department or urgent care. Limited data exist on the population proportion affected by delayed healthcare, which is important for future healthcare planning efforts. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare service cancellations or delays and delays/avoidance of emergency/urgent care overall and by population characteristics.
Study design
This was a cross-sectional study.
Methods
Our sample (n = 2314) was assembled through a phone survey from 8/12/2020–10/27/2020 among non-institutionalized St. Louis County, Missouri, USA residents ≥18 years. We asked about provider and patient-initiated cancellations or delays of appointments and pandemic-associated delays/avoidance of emergency/urgent care overall and by participant characteristics. We calculated weighted prevalence estimates by select resident characteristics.
Results
Healthcare services cancellations or delays affected ∼54% (95% CI 50.6%–57.1%) of residents with dental (31.1%, 95% CI 28.1%–34.0%) and primary care (22.1%, 95% CI 19.5%–24.6%) being most common. The highest prevalences were among those who were White, ≥65 years old, female, in fair/poor health, who had health insurance, and who had ≥1 medical condition. Delayed or avoided emergency/urgent care impacted ∼23% (95% CI 19.9%–25.4%) of residents with a higher prevalence in females than males.
Conclusions
Healthcare use disruptions impacted a substantial proportion of residents. Future healthcare planning efforts should consider these data to minimize potential morbidity and mortality from delayed care.

AB  - Summary
Background
Healthcare-acquired COVID-19 has been an additional burden on hospitals managing increasing numbers of patients with SARS-CoV-2. One acute hospital (W) among three in a Scottish healthboard experienced an unexpected surge of COVID-19 clusters.
Aim
To investigate possible causes of COVID-19 clusters at Hospital W.
Methods
Daily surveillance provided total numbers of patients and staff involved in clusters in three acute hospitals (H, M and W) and care homes across the healthboard. All clusters were investigated and documented, along with patient boarding, community infection rates and outdoor temperatures from October 2020 to March 2021. Selected SARS-CoV-2 strains were genotyped.
Findings
There were 19 COVID-19 clusters on 14 wards at Hospital W during the six-month study period, lasting from two to 42 days (average, five days; median, 14 days) and involving an average of nine patients (range 1–24) and seven staff (range 0–17). COVID-19 clusters in Hospitals H and M reflected community infection rates. An outbreak management team implemented a control package including daily surveillance; ward closures; universal masking; screening; restricting staff and patient movement; enhanced cleaning; and improved ventilation. Forty clusters occurred across all three hospitals before a January window-opening policy, after which there were three during the remainder of the study.
Conclusion
The winter surge of COVID-19 clusters was multi-factorial, but clearly exacerbated by moving trauma patients around the hospital. An extended infection prevention and control package including enhanced natural ventilation helped reduce COVID-19 clusters in acute hospitals.

AB  - COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, was first introduced to human populations in December, 2019. There was no pre-existing population immunity and thus the disease spread rapidly throughout the globe. Since its emergence, greater population level immunity has been acquired, notably through the advent of vaccines; however, newer COVID-19 variants have also resulted in increased transmissibility.

AB  - New York City, the most populated urban center in the United States, is exposed to a variety of natural hazards. These range from extratropical storms and coastal flooding to extreme heat and cold temperatures, and have been shown to unevenly impact the various vulnerable groups in the city. As the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020 and the city became an early epicenter, disparities in exposure led to widely uneven infection and mortality rates. This study maps the overlapping heat and COVID-19 risks in New York City with a multi-hazard risk framework during Summer 2020. To do so, we simulate neighborhood scale temperatures using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with a multi-layer urban parameterization. Simulation outputs were combined with zipcode-scale COVID-19 and sociodemographic data to compute a multi-hazard risk index. Our results highlight several regions where high social vulnerability, COVID-19 infection rates, and heat coincide. Moreover, we use the local indicators of spatial association technique to map regions of spatially correlated high multi-hazard risk in the NYC boroughs of The Bronx and parts of Brooklyn and Queens. These high risk locations account for nearly a quarter of the city's population, with households earning less than half than those in the lowest risk zones.

This chapter explores how these questions have been changing since the beginning of the pandemic as well as the models used to answer them. Special emphasis is given to the limitations of the mathematical modeling that appeared with this ongoing disease, and whenever possible, strategies will be proposed to address these limitations. Mexico will be used as a case study.

AB  - The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is yet to be controlled worldwide, especially in India. The second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) led to panic and confusion in India, owing to the overwhelming number of the population that fell prey to this highly infectious virus of recent times. In the second wave of COVID-19, the patients had to fight both the virus and opportunistic infections triggered by fungi and bacteria. Repeated use of steroids, antibiotics, and oxygen masks during the management of severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients nurtured opportunistic infections such as mucormycosis. Despite mucormycosis being a decades-old disease, it has gained notice of its widespread occurrence in COVID-19 patients throughout India. Instances of mucormycosis are usually unearthed in immunocompromised individuals and are caused by the inhalation of filamentous fungi, either from the natural environment or through supportive care units. In the recent outbreak during the second wave of COVID-19 in India, it has been seen to cause secondary infection as it grows along with the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients with comorbidities such as diabetes were more likely to have the mucormycosis co-infection because of their challenged immune systems’ inability to fight it. Despite the hype, mucormycosis still remains neglected and least studied, which is predominantly due to all focus on diagnostics, vaccine, and therapeutic research. In this review, we emphasize mainly on the association of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients. We also present the molecular mechanism of mucormycosis for a better understanding of the fungal infections in patients who have recently been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Better understanding of fungal pathogens, immediate diagnosis, and management of the infections are crucial in COVID-19 patients, as high mortalities have been recorded in co-infected patients despite recovery from COVID-19.

AB  - The pandemic COVID-19 presents a major challenge to identify effective drugs for treatment. Clinicians need evidence based on randomized trials regarding effective medical treatments for this infection. Currently no effective therapies exist for the progression of the mild forms to severe disease. Knowledge however is rapidly expanding. Remdesivir, an anti- retroviral agent has in vitro activity against this virus and has shown to decrease the duration of ICU care in patients with severe disease, while low dose dexamethasone also showed a decrease in the duration of stay in cases of severe disease requiring assisted ventilation. At the time of writing this article, two mRNA-based vaccines have shown an approximate 95 % efficacy in preventing infection in large clinical trials. At least one of these drugs has regulatory permission for vaccination in high-income countries. Low and middle-income countries may have difficulties in initiating vaccine programs on large scales because of availability, costs, refrigeration and dissemination. Adequately powered randomized trials are required for drugs with in vitro activity against the virus. Supportive care should be provided for stable, hypoxia and pneumonia free patients on imaging. Vaccines are of obvious benefit and given the preliminary evidence of the efficacy of over 95 %, Low and middle-income countries must develop links with the WHO COVAX program to ensure global distribution of vaccines.

AB  - Purpose
Breast cancer (BC) patients’ (pts) management was affected by a global reorganization after Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our multicenter study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on access to diagnosis, staging and treatment for BC pts compared to pre-pandemic.
Methods
Medical records of all consecutive newly diagnosed BC pts referred to 6 Italian Institutions between March and December 2020 were assessed. Monthly access rate and temporal intervals between date of symptoms onset, radiological, cytohistological diagnosis and treatment start were analyzed and compared with 2019.
Results
A reduction (25%) in newly diagnosed BC was observed compared to 2019 (666 vs 890). New BC pts in 2020 were less likely to be diagnosed with early stage BC (77% vs 83%, p < 0.01), had a worse performance status according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG PS) (19.8% had PS > 0 in 2020 vs 16.5% in 2019, p < 0.01) and fewer pts were asymptomatic at diagnosis in 2020 (54% vs 71%,p < 0.01). COVID-19 did not negatively impact in terms of access to diagnosis, staging and treatment. Time intervals between symptom onset and radiological diagnosis, symptom onset and cytohistological diagnosis, cytohistological diagnosis and treatment start were maintained or improved. However, less cases were discussed in multidisciplinary tumor meetings during 2020 (60% vs 73%, p < 0.01).
Conclusions
Our data proved an alarming reduction of early stage BC associated with the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. Despite the upheaval generated by the pandemic, our study shed light on the effective performance delivered by Italian Oncology Departments to guarantee diagnostic-therapeutic pathways.

AB  - The world is engulfed by one of the most widespread and significant public health crises in decades as COVID-19 has become among the leading causes of death internationally. The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus which causes COVID-19 has unified the scientific community in search of therapeutic and preventative solutions. The top priorities at the moment are twofold: first, to repurpose already-approved pharmacologic agents or develop novel therapies to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the ever-spreading virus. Secondly, the scientific and larger pharmaceutical community have been tasked with the development, testing, and production of a safe and effective vaccine as a longer-term solution to prevent further spread and recurrence throughout the populace. The purpose of this article is to review the most up-to-date published data regarding both the leading pharmacological therapies undergoing clinical trials and vaccine candidates in development to stem the threat of COVID-19.

AB  - Background
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common arrhythmias encountered in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are racial disparities in the incidence of AF and COVID-19. Several studies have reported an association between AF and mortality. However, it remains to be determined if AF represents an independent risk factor for COVID-19-related mortality.
Methods
A propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis was performed using data from the National Inpatient Sample to assess the risk of mortality among patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection and incident AF from March 2020 through December 2020.
Results
AF was less common among patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 as compared to those who tested negative (6.8% vs 7.4%, p < 0.001). White individuals with the virus had an increased incidence of AF but had lower mortality rates relative to Black and Hispanic patients. After PSM analysis, AF retained a significantly increased odds of mortality among patients with SARS-CoV-2 (OR: 1.35, CI: 1.29–1.41, p < 0.001).
Conclusion
This PSM analysis shows that AF is an independent risk factor for inpatient mortality in those with SARS-CoV-2 infection and that White patients, while having a higher burden of SARS-CoV-2 and AF, demonstrate a significantly lower mortality rate as compared to their Black and Hispanic counterparts.

AB  - In this study, we investigate whether COVID-19 deaths that occurred before vaccination rollouts impact subsequent vaccination take-up. We use data on local vaccination rates and COVID-19-related deaths from England measured at high geographic granularity. We find that vaccination take-up as of November 2021 is positively associated with pre-vaccine COVID-19-related deaths, controlling for demographic, economic, and health-related characteristics of the localities, while including geographic fixed effects. In addition, the share of ethnic minorities in a locality is negatively associated with vaccination rates, and localities with a larger share of ethnic minorities increase their vaccination rates if they are exposed to more COVID-related-deaths. Further evidence on vaccination intention at the individual level from a representative sample corroborates these patterns. Overall, our evidence suggests that social proximity to victims of the disease triggers a desire to take protective measures against it.

AB  - Summary
Hospital-onset COVID-19 infections (HOCIs) are associated with excess morbidity and mortality in patients and healthcare workers. The aim of this review was to explore and describe the current literature in HOCI surveillance. Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and MedRxiv were searched up to 30 November 2020 using broad search criteria. Articles of HOCI surveillance systems were included. Data describing HOCI definitions, HOCI incidence, types of HOCI identification surveillance systems, and level of system implementation were extracted. A total of 292 citations were identified. Nine studies on HOCI surveillance were included. Six studies reported on the proportion of HOCI among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which ranged from 0 to 15.2%. Six studies provided HOCI case definitions. Standardized national definitions provided by the UK and US governments were identified. Four studies included healthcare workers in the surveillance. One study articulated a multimodal strategy of infection prevention and control practices including HOCI surveillance. All identified HOCI surveillance systems were implemented at institutional level, with eight studies focusing on all hospital inpatients and one study focusing on patients in the emergency department. Multiple types of surveillance were identified. Four studies reported automated surveillance, of which one included real-time analysis, and one included genomic data. Overall, the study quality was limited by the observational nature with short follow-up periods. In conclusion, HOCI case definitions and surveillance methods were developed pragmatically. Whilst standardized case definitions and surveillance systems are ideal for integration with existing routine surveillance activities and adoption in different settings, we acknowledged the difficulties in establishing such standards in the short-term.

AB  - Introduction
COVID-19 infection in pregnancy ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe disease. However, the maternal and pregnancy outcomes are primarily favorable. Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI) score is a Visual Triage Checklist for Acute Respiratory symptoms created by the ministry of health of Saudi Arabia 12 to screen the patient for acute respiratory infection with MERS-CoV. It has been used during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify suspected cases and place patients in isolation precautions if the score is≥ 4.
Method
This study is a cross-sectional study of all pregnant women who tested positive for COVID-19 in four medical centers located in four different cities in Saudi Arabia. The study period was from 1/3/2020 until 31/10/2020. Outcomes investigated were the prevalence of COVID infection in pregnant women at the time of delivery. Rate of asymptomatic disease, different maternal and pregnancy outcomes. Women were divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic groups according to the ARI score. The two groups were compared in maternal, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes. Furthermore, the cohort was divided according to maternal age into two groups: women of advanced maternal age ≥ 35 years and younger. The two groups were compared in maternal, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes
Results
During the study period, 9573 women gave birth at KAMCs, and 402 pregnant women were identified as COVID positive. Out of all COVID-positive women, only 394 women gave birth at KAMCs. The screening for COVID infection differed between the centers, but the testing was the same by the Nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab. In Riyadh, screening was based on ARI scoring at the beginning of the pandemic. Then, it became universal. In Jeddah, the screening was based on ARI scoring. Any woman who scored four or more was labeled as suspected, and she was tested. Finally, in Madinah and Dammam, the screening was universal throughout the study. The prevalence of COVID-19 infection among women who gave birth at KAMCs was 4.2% (402/9573). (CI 3.8–4.6%). At the time of diagnosis, most women (62%) were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath. Twenty-two women (5.5%) had Pneumonia, and five women (1.3%) needed admission to Intensive care units (ICU). One woman died due to respiratory failure. When pregnancy outcomes were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic women, pregnancy in symptomatic women was more likely to be complicated by Abortion (6 versus 2% p-value 0.00), fetal death (3 versus 1.3%), and cesarean delivery (30.8 versus 22.4%, p-value 0.001). COVID-positive pregnant women of advanced maternal age (AMA) were more likely to be symptomatic, have Abortion (5 versus 1%, p-value 0.01), and have Preterm delivery (17 versus 11% p-value 0.01) than younger women. In addition, neonatal death was more common in AMA COVID-positive women than younger (4 versus 0%), regardless of COVID-related symptoms.
Conclusion
Most of the COVID-infected pregnant women are asymptomatic. Therefore, the ARI scoring system does not help to triage patients. Symptomatic women, especially those older than 35, tend to have a higher maternal and pregnancy complication rate.

AB  - COVID-19 is a multisystem disease and cause of a global pandemic. Lately, cases of disease progression of HPV-infected CIN under SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported giving rise to the hypothesis of direct virus-infection induced pro-carcinogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2. We herein present a case of rapid progression from HPV-induced CIN 2 to microinvasive carcinoma within three months under COVID-19 without direct virus infection. Histopathologic evaluation, Fluorescence-in-situ hybridization and qRT-PCR against SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as gene expression analysis were performed from the available FFPE-tissue and accompanied by an analysis of white blood cell differential. No signs of direct SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 typical alterations of cervical tissue were found. As expected, p53 decreased in expression with progression of dysplasia, while APOBEC3A and VISTA showed a decrease in expression contrary to observations in dysplasia progression. PD-L1 was expressed consistently or increased slightly but did not show the expected strong induction of expression. DNMT1 showed an increase in expression in CIN III and a slight decrease in carcinoma, while DNMT3a is consistently expressed in CIN II and decreased in carcinoma. Blood tests after COVID-19 showed substantial reduction of lymphocytes, eosinophils, T-cells, and NK-cells. Our results hint at an indirect effect of COVID-19 on the cervical neoplasm. We conclude that the immune system might be preoccupied and exhausted by the concurring COVID-19 disease, leading to less immunological pressure on the HPV-infected cervical dysplasia enabling rapid disease progression. Further, indirect proangiogenic and proinflammatory micromilieu due to the multisystemic effects of COVID-19 might play an additional role

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019, China and later it was found that the causative microorganism is severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). As on 3rd June 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has affected 171049741 people worldwide with 3549710 deaths. Nanomedicine such as nanoparticles, liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, virus-like nanoparticles offer tremendous hopes to treat viral infections including COVID-19. Most importantly target specific ligands can be attached on the surface of them and this makes them more target specific and the loaded drug can be delivered to cellular and molecular level. These properties of nanomedicines can be utilized to deliver drugs or vaccines to treat viral diseases including SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review discusses about SARS-CoV-2 and the potential application of nanomedicines for delivering biological macromolecules like vaccines and drugs for treating COVID-19.

AB  - The potential emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants capable of escaping vaccine-generated immune responses poses a looming threat to vaccination efforts and will likely prolong the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the prevalence of beta coronaviruses circulating in animals and the precedent they have set in jumping into human populations indicates that they pose a continuous threat for future pandemics. Currently, only one therapeutic is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in treating COVID-19, remdesivir, although other therapies are authorized for emergency use due to this pandemic being a public health emergency. In this review, twenty-four different treatments are discussed regarding their use against COVID-19 and any potential future coronavirus-associated illnesses. Their traditional use, mechanism of action against COVID-19, and efficacy in clinical trials are assessed. Six treatments evaluated are shown to significantly decrease mortality in clinical trials, and ten treatments have shown some form of clinical efficacy.

AB  - Cardiovascular wellbeing has been dramatically affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the reason for the coronavirus disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. There is a greater risk of morbidity and death in individuals with preexisting heart diseases. Clinical syndromes of the acute coronary syndrome, acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, heart failure, and venous thromboembolism can, directly and indirectly, affect the heart. There may also be adverse heart effects of specific therapeutics under review for COVID-19. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) mechanism in virus replication makes it essential to understand the consequences of the system-modulating medications. For optimum patient care, detailed knowledge of specific cardiovascular symptoms of COVID-19 and the role of RAAS in the prognosis of COVID-19 disease is necessary.

AB  - Objectives
Studies that measure the prevalence of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (‘seroprevalence’) are essential to understand population exposure to SARS-CoV-2 among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. We aimed to measure seroprevalence in the Scottish population over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic – from before the first recorded case in Scotland through to the second pandemic wave.
Study design
The study design of this study is serial cross sectional.
Methods
We tested 41,477 residual samples retrieved from primary and antenatal care settings across Scotland for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over a 12-month period from December 2019-December 2020 (before rollout of COVID-19 vaccination). Five-weekly rolling seroprevalence estimates were adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the assays and weighted to reference populations. Temporal trends in seroprevalence estimates and weekly SARS-CoV-2 notifications were compared.
Results
Five-weekly rolling seroprevalence rates were 0% until the end of March, when they increased contemporaneously with the first pandemic wave. Seroprevalence rates remained stable through the summer (range: 3%–5%) during a period of social restrictions, after which they increased concurrently with the second wave, reaching 9.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.4%–10.8%) in the week beginning 28th December in 2020. Seroprevalence rates were lower in rural vs. urban areas (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.61–0.79) and among individuals aged 20–39 years and 60 years and older (AOR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.64–0.86; AOR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.69–0.91, respectively) relative to those aged 0–19 years.
Conclusions
After two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, less than one in ten individuals in the Scottish population had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Seroprevalence may underestimate the true population exposure as a result of waning antibodies among individuals who were infected early in the first wave.

Serological surveys were used to infer the infection attack rate in different populations. The sensitivity of the testing assay, Abbott, drops fast over time since infection which makes the serological data difficult to interpret. In this work, we aim to solve this issue.
Methods
We collect longitudinal serological data of Abbott to construct a sensitive decay function. We use the reported COVID-19 deaths to infer the infections, and use the decay function to simulate the seroprevalence and match to the reported seroprevalence in 12 Indian cities.
Results
Our model simulated seroprevalence matchs the reported seroprevalence in most of the 12 Indian cities. We obtain reasonable infection attack rate and infection fatality rate for most of the 12 Indian cities.
Conclusions
Using both reported COVID-19 deaths data and serological survey data, we infer the infection attack rate and infection fatality rate with increased confidence.

AB  - Background
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) accounts for a substantial proportion of sudden cardiac events globally, with hundreds of thousands of cases reported annually in the United States. The mortality rate of patients who suffer OHCA remains high despite extensive utilization of resources.
Objectives
We aim to describe the current landscape of OHCA during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide an overview of the logistical challenges and resuscitation protocols amongst emergency medical service (EMS) personnel.
Discussion
Recent studies in Italy, New York City, and France characterized a significant increase in OHCA incidence in conjunction with the arrival of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The presence of the pandemic challenged existing protocols for field resuscitation of cardiac arrest patients as the pandemic necessitated prioritization of EMS personnel and other healthcare providers' safety through stringent personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements. Studies also characterized difficulties encountered by the first responder system during COVID-19, such as dispatcher overload, increased response times, and adherence to PPE requirements, superimposed on PPE shortages. The lack of guidance by governmental agencies and specialty organizations to provide unified safety protocols for resuscitation led to the development of different resuscitative protocols globally.
Conclusions
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic modified the approach of first responders to OHCA. With the rise in OCHA during the pandemic in several geographic regions and the risks of disease transmission with superimposed equipment shortages, novel noninvasive, adjunct tools, such as point of care ultrasound, warrant consideration. Further prehospital studies should be considered to optimize OHCA and resource management while minimizing risk to personnel.

AB  - Although not a standard-of-care yet, adoptive immunotherapeutic approaches have gradually earned a place within the list of antiviral therapies for some of fatal and hard-to-treat viral diseases. To maintain robust antiviral immunity and to effectively target the viral particles and virally-infected cells, immune cells capable of recognizing the viral antigens are required. While conventional vaccination can induce these cells in vivo; another option is to prime and generate antigen-specific immune cells ex vivo. This approach has been successfully trialed for virulent opportunistic viral infections after bone marrow transplantation. Amid the crisis of SARS-CoV2 pandemic, which has been followed by the success of certain early-authorized vaccines; some institutions and companies have explored the effects of viral-specific adoptive cell transfers (ACTs) in trials, as alternative treatments. Aimed at outlining a perspective on antigen-specific adoptive immunotherapy for viral infections, this review article specifically provides an appraisal of ACT-based studies/trials on SARS-CoV2 infection.

AB  - Background
Hyperhemolysis syndrome (HHS) is an uncommon transfusion reaction described in several hematologic disorders, including sickle cell disease (SCD). HHS is characterized by a decline in hemoglobin (Hb) values below pre-transfusion levels following transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs), coupled with laboratory markers consistent with hemolysis. The proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying HHS include increased phosphatidylserine expression, macrophage activation, and complement dysregulation. Many pathophysiologic mechanisms thought to contribute to HHS have been similarly described in cases of severe COVID-19.
Case report
A 28-year-old male with a history of HbSS presented with shortness of breath, right-sided chest pain, and a two-day history of fever. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected SARS-CoV-2 infection with the omicron variant. The patient required an RBC transfusion (pre-transfusion hemoglobin [Hb]5.8 g/dL) with an immediate post-transfusion Hb of 6.3 g/dL. However, Hb rapidly declined to 1.7 g/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) rose to 8701 u/L. The absolute reticulocyte count of 538 × 109/L correspondingly fell to 29 × 109/L. Despite additional RBC transfusions and initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, he expired on Day 9(D9).
Conclusion
Given the similarities in their proposed pathophysiology, patients with SCD and concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection may be predisposed to developing HHS.

AB  - Objective
COVID-19 may have contributed to an excess of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OOHCAs). This observational study identified changes in OOHCA epidemiology pre– and post–COVID-19 lockdown in a single UK helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS).
Methods
A retrospective, single-center (Essex & Herts Air Ambulance), observational study was undertaken with anonymized OOHCA data (demographics, etiology, and outcomes) from March 23, 2020, to June 23, 2020, and comparative data from March 23, 2019, to June 23, 2019. Supplementary data (total OOHCAs and patient outcomes) were provided by the East of England Ambulance Service National Health Service Trust. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test; P < .05 was statistically significant. Results: Of the HEMS activations during national lockdown, 33.6% were for OOHCAs compared with 25.8% during the reference time frame. The frequency of young and female OOHCAs demonstrated a statistically significant increase. Statistically significant variations in medical etiology and initial cardiac rhythm were identified.
Conclusion
During the initial UK-wide lockdown, the OOHCA characteristics attended by 1 HEMS team were altered. The changes seen may be due to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 or an alteration in dispatch due to the demand placed on the wider ambulance service; this may require further consideration for any future lockdowns or pandemics.

AB  - Interferons are the best antiviral agents in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 so far and genetic defects in their signaling cascade or neutralization of alfa-interferons by autoantibodies come with more severe COVID-19. However, there is more, as the SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates not only innate immune mechanisms but also T and B cell repertoires. Most genetic, hematological and immunological studies in COVID-19 are at present phenomenological. However, these and antecedent studies contain the seed grains to resolve many unanswered questions and a whole range of testable hypotheses. What are the links, if existing, between genetics and the occurrence of interferon-neutralizing antibodies? Are NAGGED (neutralizing and generated by gene defect) antibodies involved or not? Is the autoimmune process cause or consequence of virus infection? What are the roles played by cytokine posttranslational modifications, such as proteolysis, glycosylation, citrullination and others? How is systemic autoimmunity linked with type 1 interferons? These questions place cytokines and growth factors at pole positions as keys to unlock basic mechanisms of infection and (auto)immunity. Related to cytokine research, (1) COVID-19 patients develop neutralizing autoantibodies, mainly against alpha interferons and it is not yet established whether this is the consequence or cause of virus replication. (2) The glycosylation of recombinant interferon-beta protects against breaking tolerance and the development of neutralizing antibodies. (3) SARS-CoV-2 induces severe inflammation and release of extracellular proteases leading to remnant epitopes, e.g. of cytokines. (4) In the rare event of homozygous cytokine gene segment deletions, observed neutralizing antibodies may be named NAGGED antibodies. (5) Severe cytolysis releases intracellular content into the extracellular milieu and leads to regulated degradation of intracellular proteins and selection of antibody repertoires, similar to those observed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. (6) Systematic studies of novel autoimmune diseases on single cytokines will complement the present picture about interferons. (7) Interferon neutralization in COVID-19 constitutes a preamble of more studies about cytokine-regulated proteolysis in the control of autoimmunity. Here we reformulate these seven conjectures into testable questions for future research.

AB  - Background
Migrants in high-income countries may be at increased risk of COVID-19 due to their health and social circumstances, yet the extent to which they are affected and their predisposing risk factors are not clearly understood. We did a systematic review to assess clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in migrant populations, indirect health and social impacts, and to determine key risk factors.
Methods
We did a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42020222135). We searched multiple databases to 18/11/2020 for peer-reviewed and grey literature on migrants (foreign-born) and COVID-19 in 82 high-income countries. We used our international networks to source national datasets and grey literature. Data were extracted on primary outcomes (cases, hospitalisations, deaths) and we evaluated secondary outcomes on indirect health and social impacts and risk factors using narrative synthesis.
Results
3016 data sources were screened with 158 from 15 countries included in the analysis (35 data sources for primary outcomes: cases [21], hospitalisations [4]; deaths [15]; 123 for secondary outcomes). We found that migrants are at increased risk of infection and are disproportionately represented among COVID-19 cases. Available datasets suggest a similarly disproportionate representation of migrants in reported COVID-19 deaths, as well as increased all-cause mortality in migrants in some countries in 2020. Undocumented migrants, migrant health and care workers, and migrants housed in camps have been especially affected. Migrants experience risk factors including high-risk occupations, overcrowded accommodation, and barriers to healthcare including inadequate information, language barriers, and reduced entitlement.
Conclusions
Migrants in high-income countries are at high risk of exposure to, and infection with, COVID-19. These data are of immediate relevance to national public health and policy responses to the pandemic. Robust data on testing uptake and clinical outcomes in migrants, and barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination, are urgently needed, alongside strengthening engagement with diverse migrant groups.

AB  - Utilizing population-based data from the Covid-19 phone survey (N=2,262) of the Malawi Longitudinal Study of Families and Health (MLSFH) collected during June 2nd–August 17th, 2020, we focus on the crucial role that community leadership and trust in institutions played in shaping behavioral, economic and social responses to Covid-19 in this low-income sub-Saharan African context. We argue that the effective response of Malawi to limit the spread of the virus was facilitated by the engagement of local leadership to mobilize communities to adapt and adhere to Covid-19 prevention strategies. Using linear and ordered probit models and controlling for time fixed effects, we show that village heads (VHs) played pivotal role in shaping individuals’ knowledge about the pandemic and the adoption of preventive health behaviors and were crucial for mitigating the negative economic and health consequences of the pandemic. We further show that trust in institutions is of particular importance in shaping individuals’ behavior during the pandemic, and these findings highlight the pivotal role of community leadership in fostering better compliance and adoption of public health measures essential to contain the virus. Overall, our findings point to distinctive patterns of pandemic response in a low-income sub-Saharan African rural population that emphasized local leadership as mediators of public health messages and policies. These lessons from the first pandemic wave remain relevant as in many low-income countries behavioral responses to Covid-19 will remain the primary prevention strategy for a foreseeable future.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with specific coagulopathy that frequently occurs during the different phases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and can result in thrombotic complications and/or death. This COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) exhibits some of the features associated with thrombotic microangiopathy, particularly complement-mediated hemolytic-uremic syndrome. In some cases, due to the anti-phospholipid antibodies, CAC resembles catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome. In other patients, it exhibits features of hemophagocytic syndrome. CAC is mainly identified by: increases in fibrinogen, D-dimers, and von Willebrand factor (released from activated endothelial cells), consumption of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13 (ADAMTS13), over activated and dysregulated complement, and elevated plasma cytokine levels. CAC manifests as both major cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events and dysfunctional microcirculation, which leads to multiple organ damage. It is not clear whether the mainstay of COVID-19 is complement overactivation, cytokine/chemokine activation, or a combination of these activities. Available data have suggested that non-critically ill hospitalized patients should be administered full-dose heparin. In critically ill, full dose heparin treatment is discouraged due to higher mortality rate. In addition to anti-coagulation, four different host-directed therapeutic pathways have recently emerged that influence CAC: (1) Anti-von Willebrand factor monoclonal antibodies; (2) activated complement C5a inhibitors; (3) recombinant ADAMTS13; and (4) Interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 antibodies. Moreover, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the virus surface protein have been tested. However, the role of antiplatelet treatment remains unclear for patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Background
Seasonal influenza continues to present a significant annual burden as the vaccination rate in the United States is 51.8%. Emergency Department (ED) based influenza programs have been successfully implemented and improve vaccine uptake, reduce incidence and costs, and improve outcomes.
Objective
To develop a predictive model to assess preventable influenza cases, hospitalizations, fatalities, and incremental cost avoidance based on the unvaccinated population.
Methods
A retrospective cohort of ED encounters limited to Medicare and Medicaid populations was performed across 14 tertiary care hospital EDs and six freestanding EDs for 2020. The total number of unvaccinated individuals was identified to determine the potential impact of an ED vaccination campaign. The average cost and loss per inpatient stay was identified from prior industry Medicare benchmark data and was utilized to extrapolate Medicaid losses. Results from published cost-effectiveness studies identified the vaccination thresholds to prevent one additional case of influenza, one additional hospitalization, and one additional fatality.
Results
A total of 39,463 unvaccinated individuals were identified, with 14,064 classified as Medicare, and 25,379 classified as Medicaid. Assuming a 95% target outreach, 90% medical eligibility, and 70% acceptance rate, 414 influenza cases would be prevented (266 Medicaid, 148 Medicare), 28 hospitalizations would be prevented (18 Medicaid, 10 Medicare), and eight deaths would be prevented (5 Medicaid, 3 Medicare). Accordingly, a reduction in admissions would prevent $409,360 in total inpatient medical costs and $36,232 in losses to healthcare systems.
Conclusion
An ED-based influenza vaccination program would have a measurable impact on patient influenza disease burden and associated medical expenditures.

AB  - Prior to COVID-19, only two human-tropic coronaviruses resulted in epidemics and cerebrovascular disease was rarely reported. Evidence now suggests that 1–6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients develop stroke. According to some reports, stroke risk is more than sevenfold greater in patients with COVID-19 than influenza. Concerningly, outcomes of COVID-19-related stroke are often worse than in stroke patients without COVID-19 from the same cohorts. In this review, we highlight the emerging association between COVID-19 and stroke and discuss putative pathogenetic mechanisms. Etiology of stroke in COVID-19 patients is likely multifactorial, related to coagulopathy, inflammation, platelet activation, and alterations to the vascular endothelium. Significant work remains to be done to better understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related stroke and for designing optimal primary and secondary prevention strategies.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with a declining volume of patients seen in the emergency department. Despite the need for seeking urgent care for conditions such as myocardial infarction, many people may not seek treatment. This study seeks to measure associations between the COVID-19 pandemic and location of death among individuals who died from ischemic heart disease (IHD). Data obtained from death certificates from the Arkansas Department of Health was used to conduct a difference-in-difference analysis to assess whether decedents of IHD were more likely to die at home during the pandemic (March 2020 through September 2020). The analysis compared location of death for decedents of IHD pre and during the pandemic to location of death for decedents from non-natural causes. Before the pandemic, 50.0% of decedents of IHD died at home compared to 57.9% dying at home during (through September 2020) the pandemic study period (p < .001). There was no difference in the proportion of decedents who died at home from non-natural causes before and during the pandemic study period (55.8% vs. 53.5%; p = .21). After controlling for confounders, there was a 48% increase in the odds of dying at home from IHD during the pandemic study period (p < .001) relative to the change in dying at home due to non-natural causes. During the study period, there was an increase in the proportion of decedents who died at home due to IHD. Despite the ongoing pandemic, practitioners should emphasize the need to seek urgent care during an emergency.

AB  - The future of international passenger transport is largely determined by how the post-COVID border opening will proceed. The restoration of full-fledged work of transport enterprises and other sectors of the economy in the conditions of a new normality, as well as the life and health of people depend on this. On the example of Russia, it was found that post-COVID border opening is characterized by contradictory trends: opening borders is more difficult and longer than closing them; ensuring epidemiological security is imposed on the principles of reciprocity, proximity and poorly diagnosed political preferences. According to epidemiological indicators, the re-closing of borders may be hindered by the limited state budget for providing economic assistance to affected transport enterprises, the unwillingness of the authorities to ‘annoy’ the population with unpopular decisions. At the same time the widespread information coverage in the mass media of news related to the disease in other countries can contribute to border re-closing. In such conditions, transport policy balances between a choice in favor of epidemiological well-being and a decline in the economy, or in favor of economic recovery with a deterioration in the epidemiological situation. The presented results and identified trends can be used in the implementation of transport policy and ensuring epidemiological safety.

AB  - Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic is unlikely to end until there is global roll-out of vaccines that protect against severe disease and preferably drive herd immunity. Regulators in numerous countries have authorised or approved COVID-19 vaccines for human use, with more expected to be licensed in 2021. Yet having licensed vaccines is not enough to achieve global control of COVID-19: they also need to be produced at scale, priced affordably, allocated globally so that they are available where needed, and widely deployed in local communities. In this Health Policy paper, we review potential challenges to success in each of these dimensions and discuss policy implications. To guide our review, we developed a dashboard to highlight key characteristics of 26 leading vaccine candidates, including efficacy levels, dosing regimens, storage requirements, prices, production capacities in 2021, and stocks reserved for low-income and middle-income countries. We use a traffic-light system to signal the potential contributions of each candidate to achieving global vaccine immunity, highlighting important trade-offs that policy makers need to consider when developing and implementing vaccination programmes. Although specific datapoints are subject to change as the pandemic response progresses, the dashboard will continue to provide a useful lens through which to analyse the key issues affecting the use of COVID-19 vaccines. We also present original data from a 32-country survey (n=26 758) on potential acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, conducted from October to December, 2020. Vaccine acceptance was highest in Vietnam (98%), India (91%), China (91%), Denmark (87%), and South Korea (87%), and lowest in Serbia (38%), Croatia (41%), France (44%), Lebanon (44%), and Paraguay (51%).

AB  - The Brighton Collaboration Benefit-Risk Assessment of VAccines by TechnolOgy (BRAVATO) Working Group has prepared standardized templates to describe the key considerations for the benefit-risk assessment of several vaccine platform technologies, including nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) vaccines. This paper uses the BRAVATO template to review the features of a vaccine employing a proprietary mRNA vaccine platform to develop Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273); a highly effective vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In response to the pandemic the first in human studies began in March 2020 and the pivotal, placebo-controlled phase 3 efficacy study in over 30,000 adults began in July 2020. Based on demonstration of efficacy and safety at the time of interim analysis in November 2020 and at the time of trial unblinding in March 2021, the mRNA-1273 received Emergency Use Authorization in December 2020 and full FDA approval in January 2022.

AB  - The pandemic COVID-19 brings with it the need for studies and tools to help those in charge make decisions. Working with classical time series methods such as ARIMA and SARIMA has shown promising results in the first studies of COVID-19. We advance in this branch by proposing a risk factor map induced by the well-known Pearson diagram based on multivariate kurtosis and skewness measures to analyze the dynamics of deaths from COVID-19. In particular, we combine bootstrap for time series with SARIMA modeling in a new paradigm to construct a map on which one can analyze the dynamics of a set of time series. The proposed map allows a risk analysis of multiple countries in the four different periods of the pandemic COVID-19 in 55 countries. Our empirical evidence suggests a direct relationship between the multivariate skewness and kurtosis. We observe that the multivariate kurtosis increase leads to the rise of the multivariate skewness. Our findings reveal that the countries with high risk from the behavior of the number of deaths tend to have pronounced skewness and kurtosis values.

AB  - The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic’s steady condition coupled with predominance of emerging contaminants in the environment and its synergistic implications in recent times has stoked interest in combating medical emergencies in this dynamic environment. In this context, high concentrations of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), microplastics (MPs), antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and soaring coinfecting microbes, tied with potential endocrine disruptive (ED) are critical environmental concerns that requires a detailed documentation and analysis. During the pandemic, the identification, enumeration, and assessment of potential hazards of PPCPs and MPs and (used as anti-COVID-19 agents/applications) in aquatic habitats have been attempted globally. Albeit receding threats in the magnitude of COVID-19 infections, both these pollutants have still posed serious consequences to aquatic ecosystems and the very health and hygiene of the population in the vicinity. The surge in the contaminants post-COVID also renders them to be potent vectors to harbor and amplify AMR. Pertinently, the present work attempts to critically review such instances to understand the underlying mechanism, interactions swaying the current health of our environment during this post-COVID-19 era. During this juncture, although prevention of diseases, patient care, and self-hygiene have taken precedence, nevertheless antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) efforts have been overlooked. Unnecessary usage of PPCPs and plastics during the pandemic has resulted in increased emerging contaminants (i.e., active pharmaceutical ingredients and MPs) in various environmental matrices. It was also noticed that among COVID-19 patients, while the bacterial co-infection prevalence was 0.2–51%, the fungi, viral, protozoan and helminth were 0.3–49, 1–22, 2–15, 0.4–15% respectively, rendering them resistant to residual PPCPs. There are inevitable chances of ED effects from PPCPs and MPs applied previously, that could pose far-reaching health concerns. Furthermore, clinical and other experimental evidence for many newer compounds is very scarce and demands further research. Pro-active measures targeting effective waste management, evolved environmental policies aiding strict regulatory measures, and scientific research would be crucial in minimizing the impact and creating better preparedness towards such events among the masses fostering sustainability.

AB  - Summary
Background
The safety and immunogenicity profile of COVID-19 vaccines when administered concomitantly with seasonal influenza vaccines have not yet been reported. We therefore aimed to report the results of a substudy within a phase 3 UK trial, by evaluating the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 when co-administered with licensed seasonal influenza vaccines.
Methods
We did a planned exploratory substudy as part of the randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) by co-administrating the influenza vaccine at four study hospitals in the UK. Approximately, the first 400 participants meeting the main study entry criteria—with no contraindications to influenza vaccination—were invited to join the substudy. Participants of the main study were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive two intramuscular injections of either NVX-CoV2373 (5 μg) or placebo (normal saline) 21 days apart; participants enrolled into the substudy were co-vaccinated with a single (0·5 mL) intramuscular, age-appropriate (quadrivalent influenza cell-based vaccine [Flucelvax Quadrivalent; Seqirus UK, Maidenhead] for those aged 18–64 years and adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine [Fluad; Seqirus UK, Maidenhead] for those ≥65 years), licensed, influenza vaccine on the opposite deltoid to that of the first study vaccine dose or placebo. The influenza vaccine was administered in an open-label manner and at the same time as the first study injection. Reactogenicity was evaluated via an electronic diary for 7 days after vaccination in addition to monitoring for unsolicited adverse events, medically attended adverse events, and serious adverse events. Immunogenicity was assessed with influenza haemagglutination inhibition and SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike protein IgG assays. Vaccine efficacy against PCR-confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19 was assessed in participants who were seronegative at baseline, received both doses of study vaccine or placebo, had no major protocol deviations affecting the primary endpoint, and had no confirmed cases of symptomatic COVID-19 from the first dose until 6 days after the second dose (per-protocol efficacy population). Immunogenicity was assessed in participants who received scheduled two doses of study vaccine, had a baseline sample and at least one post-vaccination sample, and had no major protocol violations before unmasking (per-protocol immunogenicity population). Reactogenicity was analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo and had data collected for reactogenicity events. Safety was analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo. Comparisons were made between participants of the substudy and the main study (who were not co-vaccinated for influenza). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04583995.
Findings
Between Sept 28, 2020, and Nov 28, 2020, a total of 15 187 participants were randomised into the main phase 3 trial, of whom 15 139 received treatment (7569 received dose one of NVX-CoV2373 and 7570 received dose one of placebo). 431 participants were co-vaccinated with a seasonal influenza vaccine in the substudy (217 received NVX-CoV2373 plus the influenza vaccine and 214 received placebo plus the influenza vaccine). In general, the substudy participants were younger, more racially diverse, and had fewer comorbid conditions than those in the main study. Reactogenicity events were more common in the co-administration group than in the NVX-CoV2373 alone group: tenderness (113 [64·9%] of 174 vs 592 [53·3%] of 1111) or pain (69 [39·7%] vs 325 [29·3%]) at injection site, fatigue (48 [27·7%] vs 215 [19·4%]), and muscle pain (49 [28·3%] vs 237 [21·4%]). Incidences of unsolicited adverse events, treatment-related medically attended adverse events, and serious adverse events were low and balanced between the co-administration group and the NVX-CoV2373 alone group. No episodes of anaphylaxis or deaths were reported within the substudy. Co-administration resulted in no change to influenza vaccine immune response although a reduction in antibody responses to the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was noted. NVX-CoV2373 vaccine efficacy in the substudy (ie, participants aged 18 to <65 years) was 87·5% (95% CI −0·2 to 98·4) and in the main study was 89·8% (95% CI 79·7–95·5).
Interpretation
To our knowledge, this substudy is the first to show the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy profile of a COVID-19 vaccine when co-administered with seasonal influenza vaccines. Our results suggest concomitant vaccination might be a viable immunisation strategy.

AB  - The ongoing coronavirus pandemic responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly increased the rate of global death and infections due to variant mutations (such as Delta and Omicron). While specifically developed and approved vaccines can limit the spread of disease in a population and severity of resulting symptoms, none have been demonstrated to effectively prevent infection altogether. Thus, reliable early diagnosis of COVID-19 is critical to identify positive cases to help contain the outbreak. Herein we report a label-free electrochemical immunosensor for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 by using nitrogen-doped holey graphene (N-HRGO) as a nanocarrier decorated with thionine (TH) molecules as electrochemical indicators. With the spike protein located on the surface of the COVID-19 particles as the model target, the as-prepared electrochemical immunosensor could detect the presence of the COVID-19 spike protein over a wide linear range (1 pg mL−1−10 ng mL−1) with a low detection limit (0.3 pg mL−1). In addition, the developed electrochemical immunosensor exhibited an excellent selectivity (with insignificant current changes towards interfering proteins comparing with COVID-19 spike protein), a good reproducibility and long-term storage stability. Importantly, the electrochemical immunosensor thus developed could successfully and reliably detect the spike protein of COVID-19 in saliva and human serum complex samples. Thus, the as-prepared label-free electrochemical immunosensor can achieve rapid and sensitive detection of the COVID-19 spike protein, as a promising clinical diagnosis tool in monitoring the progression of COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
Background
The infection–fatality ratio (IFR) is a metric that quantifies the likelihood of an individual dying once infected with a pathogen. Understanding the determinants of IFR variation for COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has direct implications for mitigation efforts with respect to clinical practice, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and the prioritisation of risk groups for targeted vaccine delivery. The IFR is also a crucial parameter in COVID-19 dynamic transmission models, providing a way to convert a population's mortality rate into an estimate of infections.
Methods
We estimated age-specific and all-age IFR by matching seroprevalence surveys to total COVID-19 mortality rates in a population. The term total COVID-19 mortality refers to an estimate of the total number of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19. After applying exclusion criteria to 5131 seroprevalence surveys, the IFR analyses were informed by 2073 all-age surveys and 718 age-specific surveys (3012 age-specific observations). When seroprevalence was reported by age group, we split total COVID-19 mortality into corresponding age groups using a Bayesian hierarchical model to characterise the non-linear age pattern of reported deaths for a given location. To remove the impact of vaccines on the estimated IFR age pattern, we excluded age-specific observations of seroprevalence and deaths that occurred after vaccines were introduced in a location. We estimated age-specific IFR with a non-linear meta-regression and used the resulting age pattern to standardise all-age IFR observations to the global age distribution. All IFR observations were adjusted for baseline and waning antibody-test sensitivity. We then modelled age-standardised IFR as a function of time, geography, and an ensemble of 100 of the top-performing covariate sets. The covariates included seven clinical predictors (eg, age-standardised obesity prevalence) and two measures of health system performance. Final estimates for 190 countries and territories, as well as subnational locations in 11 countries and territories, were obtained by predicting age-standardised IFR conditional on covariates and reversing the age standardisation.
Findings
We report IFR estimates for April 15, 2020, to January 1, 2021, the period before the introduction of vaccines and widespread evolution of variants. We found substantial heterogeneity in the IFR by age, location, and time. Age-specific IFR estimates form a J shape, with the lowest IFR occurring at age 7 years (0·0023%, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0·0015–0·0039) and increasing exponentially through ages 30 years (0·0573%, 0·0418–0·0870), 60 years (1·0035%, 0·7002–1·5727), and 90 years (20·3292%, 14·6888–28·9754). The countries with the highest IFR on July 15, 2020, were Portugal (2·085%, 0·946–4·395), Monaco (1·778%, 1·265–2·915), Japan (1·750%, 1·302–2·690), Spain (1·710%, 0·991–2·718), and Greece (1·637%, 1·155–2·678). All-age IFR varied by a factor of more than 30 among 190 countries and territories. After age standardisation, the countries with the highest IFR on July 15, 2020, were Peru (0·911%, 0·636–1·538), Portugal (0·850%, 0·386–1·793), Oman (0·762%, 0·381–1·399), Spain (0·751%, 0·435–1·193), and Mexico (0·717%, 0·426–1·404). Subnational locations with high IFRs also included hotspots in the UK and southern and eastern states of the USA. Sub-Saharan African countries and Asian countries generally had the lowest all-age and age-standardised IFRs. Population age structure accounted for 74% of logit-scale variation in IFRs estimated for 39 in-sample countries on July 15, 2020. A post-hoc analysis showed that high rates of transmission in the care home population might account for higher IFRs in some locations. Among all countries and territories, we found that the median IFR decreased from 0·466% (interquartile range 0·223–0·840) to 0·314% (0·143–0·551) between April 15, 2020, and Jan 1, 2021.
Interpretation
Estimating the IFR for global populations helps to identify relative vulnerabilities to COVID-19. Information about how IFR varies by age, time, and location informs clinical practice and non-pharmaceutical interventions like physical distancing measures, and underpins vaccine risk stratification. IFR and mortality risk form a J shape with respect to age, which previous research, such as that by Glynn and Moss in 2020, has identified to be a common pattern among infectious diseases. Understanding the experience of a population with COVID-19 mortality requires consideration for local factors; IFRs varied by a factor of more than 30 among 190 countries and territories in this analysis. In particular, the presence of elevated age-standardised IFRs in countries with well resourced health-care systems indicates that factors beyond health-care capacity are important. Potential extenuating circumstances include outbreaks among care home residents, variable burdens of severe cases, and the population prevalence of comorbid conditions that increase the severity of COVID-19 disease. During the pre-vaccine period, the estimated 33% decrease in median IFR over 8 months suggests that treatment for COVID-19 has improved over time. Estimating IFR for the pre-vaccine era provides an important baseline for describing the progression of COVID-19 mortality patterns.

AB  - Summary
Background
Communicable disease control has long been a focus of global health policy. There have been substantial reductions in the burden and mortality of communicable diseases among children younger than 5 years, but we know less about this burden in older children and adolescents, and it is unclear whether current programmes and policies remain aligned with targets for intervention. This knowledge is especially important for policy and programmes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to use the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019 to systematically characterise the burden of communicable diseases across childhood and adolescence.
Methods
In this systematic analysis of the GBD study from 1990 to 2019, all communicable diseases and their manifestations as modelled within GBD 2019 were included, categorised as 16 subgroups of common diseases or presentations. Data were reported for absolute count, prevalence, and incidence across measures of cause-specific mortality (deaths and years of life lost), disability (years lived with disability [YLDs]), and disease burden (disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs]) for children and adolescents aged 0–24 years. Data were reported across the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and across time (1990–2019), and for 204 countries and territories. For HIV, we reported the mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) as a measure of health system performance.
Findings
In 2019, there were 3·0 million deaths and 30·0 million years of healthy life lost to disability (as measured by YLDs), corresponding to 288·4 million DALYs from communicable diseases among children and adolescents globally (57·3% of total communicable disease burden across all ages). Over time, there has been a shift in communicable disease burden from young children to older children and adolescents (largely driven by the considerable reductions in children younger than 5 years and slower progress elsewhere), although children younger than 5 years still accounted for most of the communicable disease burden in 2019. Disease burden and mortality were predominantly in low-SDI settings, with high and high-middle SDI settings also having an appreciable burden of communicable disease morbidity (4·0 million YLDs in 2019 alone). Three cause groups (enteric infections, lower-respiratory-tract infections, and malaria) accounted for 59·8% of the global communicable disease burden in children and adolescents, with tuberculosis and HIV both emerging as important causes during adolescence. HIV was the only cause for which disease burden increased over time, particularly in children and adolescents older than 5 years, and especially in females. Excess MIRs for HIV were observed for males aged 15–19 years in low-SDI settings.
Interpretation
Our analysis supports continued policy focus on enteric infections and lower-respiratory-tract infections, with orientation to children younger than 5 years in settings of low socioeconomic development. However, efforts should also be targeted to other conditions, particularly HIV, given its increased burden in older children and adolescents. Older children and adolescents also experience a large burden of communicable disease, further highlighting the need for efforts to extend beyond the first 5 years of life. Our analysis also identified substantial morbidity caused by communicable diseases affecting child and adolescent health across the world.

AB  - France is one of the most vaccine-hesitant countries in the world, including for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). After 10 months of restrictive measures and media coverage of the dangers of COVID-19, French attitudes towards a vaccine continue to deteriorate. The communication strategies of the government have not helped; in fact, they have made the situation worse. Empirical studies on the national strategy for management of the COVID-19 pandemic in France have shed light on the reasons for vaccine hesitancy. These studies have identified four pillars for the vaccination strategy: i) Communication regarding the importance of herd immunity, ii) making healthcare workers the focus of the vaccination campaign, iii) citizen mobilization and guaranteed consultations, and iv) access to free vaccines without delay. This paper discusses the evidence supporting this strategy.

AB  - Background & Aims
The World Health Organization (WHO) HBV and HCV elimination targets, set in 2016 and based on projections to 2030, were unable to consider the impact of intervening factors. To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on viral hepatitis elimination programs, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) conducted a survey in liver centers worldwide in 2021.
Methods
A web-based questionnaire was distributed (May-July 2021) to all EASL members representing clinical units providing HBV and HCV hepatitis care. Results are expressed as absolute numbers and reduction rates for each care activity.
Results
Data were collected from 32 European and 12 non-European clinical centers. Between January 2019 (pre-pandemic) and December 2020 (during the pandemic), chronic HBV consultations decreased by 32% and 26%, new referrals by 38% and 39%, HBV testing rates by 39% and 21% (for HBsAg detection) and 30% and 22% (for HBV DNA detection), and new HBV treatments by 20% and 44% (p = 0.328) in European and non-European centers, respectively. With regard to HCV during the same time frame, the overall reductions were 39% and 50% for consultations, 49% and 49% for new referrals, 11% and 38% for HCV RNA detection, and 51% and 54% for new HCV antiviral treatments for European and non-European Centers, respectively (p = 0.071).
Conclusions
All steps in the viral hepatitis care cascade have been hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a comparable impact across different centers. These data reaffirm the pandemic’s major effect on global viral hepatitis elimination programs and suggest that actions to achieve the WHO 2030 targets should be reconsidered and revised to account for each country's progress relative to pre-pandemic values.
Lay summary
The EASL multinational survey conclusively shows that viral hepatitis elimination programs, expected to provide control of hepatitis B and hepatitis C worldwide by 2030, have been held back by the COVID-19 pandemic in clinical centers from several European and non-European countries, with a comparable impact across centers. Limitations in the cascade of care for both HBV and HCV were linked to limited access to screening, consultations, specific testing, and actual treatment. As restrictions for COVID-19 begin to lift, efforts to diagnose and provide treatment for viral hepatitis should remain high on the list of priorities for public health officials to maintain the WHO elimination efforts. Measures that have been put in place to control the COVID-19 pandemic could be transferred to increasing the diagnosis and linkage to care of people with hepatitis.

AB  - Summary
As COVID-19 evolves from a pandemic to an endemic disease, the already staggering number of people that have been or will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 is only destined to increase, and the majority of humanity will be infected. It is well understood that COVID-19, like many other viral infections, leaves a significant fraction of the infected with prolonged consequences. Continued high number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, viral evolution with escape from post-infection and vaccinal immunity, and reinfections heighten the potential impact of Long COVID. Hence, the impact of COVID-19 on human health will be seen for years to come until more effective vaccines and pharmaceutical treatments become available. To that effect, it is imperative that the mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of Long COVID be elucidated. In this article, we provide an in-depth analysis of the evidence on several potential mechanisms of Long COVID and discuss their relevance to its pathogenesis.

AB  - Summary
A fraction of patients with COVID-19 develops severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the majority, including high-risk individuals, experience mild symptoms. Severe disease has been associated with higher levels of antibodies and inflammatory cytokines but often among patients with diverse demographics and comorbidity status. This study evaluated hospitalized vs. ambulatory patients with COVID-19 with demographic risk factors for severe COVID-19: median age of 63, >80% male, and >85% black and/or Hispanic. Sera were collected four to 243 days after symptom onset and evaluated for binding and functional antibodies as well as 48 cytokines and chemokines. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels and functions were similar in ambulatory and hospitalized patients. However, a strong correlation between anti-S2 antibody levels and the other antibody parameters, along with higher IL-27 levels, was observed in hospitalized but not ambulatory cases. These data indicate that antibodies against the relatively conserved S2 spike subunit and immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL-27 are potential immune determinants of COVID-19.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had disproportionate impacts on racial and ethnic minorities and other vulnerable groups. The direct inequities—higher risks for infection, hospitalization, and death among racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S.—tell only part of the story. Social determinants of health, including access to and quality of housing, employment, education, and healthcare, also contributed to the inequitable impacts of COVID-19. This is particularly pronounced among groups like essential workers, parents of school age children, racial and ethnic minority populations, and rural populations, among others. While studied for many decades, public awareness and social momentum for understanding the ramifications of interpersonal and structural discrimination on health outcomes have further underscored the importance of this work in the context of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a stark example of the consequences of failing to adequately address long-standing social determinants and structural disparities related to the public's health.

AB  - Objectives
We describe the experience of a busy metropolitan medical examiner’s office in the United States and share our navigation of the COVID-19 autopsy decision-making process. We describe key gross and microscopic findings that, with appropriate laboratory testing, should direct a pathologist towards a COVID-19-related cause of death.
Material and methods
We performed a retrospective review of 258 suspected and/or confirmed COVID-19 associated deaths that occurred between March 5, 2020, and March 4, 2021.
Results
A total of 62 cases due to fatal COVID-19 were identified; autopsy findings included diffuse alveolar damage, acute bronchopneumonia and lobar pneumonia, and pulmonary thromboemboli. Nine additional decedents had a nasopharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 and a cause of death unrelated to COVID-19. Forty-seven cases with COVID-19-like symptoms showed no laboratory or histopathologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection; the most common causes of death in this group were hypertensive or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, complications of chronic alcoholism, and pulmonary thromboemboli unrelated to infection.
Conclusions
The clinical findings associated with COVID-19 are not specific; a broad differential diagnosis should be embraced when decedents present with cough or shortness of breath. An autopsy may be indicated to identify a cause of death unrelated to COVID-19.

AB  - Summary
The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) conveys a serious global threat to health and economy. A common predisposing factor for development to serious progressive disease is presence of a low-grade inflammation, e.g., as seen in diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and heart failure. Micronutrient deficiencies may also contribute to the development of this state. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to explore the role of the nutrition to relieve progression of COVID-19. According PRISMA protocol, we conducted an online databases search including Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar and web of science for published literatures in the era of COVID-19 Outbreak regarding to the status of nutrition and COVID-19 until December 2021. There were available studies (80 studies) providing direct evidence regarding the associations between the status of nutrition and COVID-19 infection. Adequate nutritional supply is essential for resistance against other viral infections and also for improvement of immune function and reduction of inflammation. Hence, it is suggested that nutritional intervention which secures an adequate status might protect against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - coronavirus-2) and mitigate its course. We also recommend initiation of adequate nutritional supplementation in high-risk areas and/or soon after the time of suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2. Subjects in high-risk groups should have high priority for applying this nutritive adjuvant therapy that should be started prior to administration of specific and supportive medical measures.

AB  - A Lancet Commission for COVID-19 task force is shaping recommendations to achieve vaccine and therapeutics access, justice, and equity. This includes ensuring safety and effectiveness harmonized through robust systems of global pharmacovigilance and surveillance. Global production requires expanding support for development, manufacture, testing, and distribution of vaccines and therapeutics to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Global intellectual property rules must not stand in the way of research, production, technology transfer, or equitable access to essential health tools, and in context of pandemics to achieve increased manufacturing without discouraging innovation. Global governance around product quality requires channelling widely distributed vaccines through WHO prequalification (PQ)/emergency use listing (EUL) mechanisms and greater use of national regulatory authorities. A World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution would facilitate improvements and consistency in quality control and assurances. Global health systems require implementing steps to strengthen national systems for controlling COVID-19 and for influenza vaccinations for adults including pregnant and lactating women. A collaborative research network should strive to establish open access databases for bioinformatic analyses, together with programs directed at human capacity utilization and strengthening. Combating anti-science recognizes the urgency for countermeasures to address a global-wide disinformation movement dominating the internet and infiltrating parliaments and local governments.

AB  - Purpose
Resuming joint replacement arthroplasty amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown has come with various challenges that had to be dealt with utmost caution. Patients with severe arthritis experiencing a state of intolerable pain, could not be left unaddressed. Guidelines published by surgical associations, collaborative surgical author groups including public health organisations had to be modified to suit the Indian scenario and obtain optimal functional outcomes in these patients.
Methods
A retrospective cohort analysis of 147 patients who underwent arthroplasty during the pandemic (March 2020 to April 2021), for either primary or secondary arthritis, was performed. We assess the efficacy and safety of the newly established Institutional surgical peri-operative protocol at our tertiary care centre in the National Capital Region, India in response to COVID-19 guidelines. The primary outcome measures appraised was 30-day mortality and the secondary outcome measures included length of stay, peri-operative complications and COVID-19 infection.
Result
The most common indication for arthroplasty during the pandemic was neglected trauma. One patient died, due to myocardial infarction during the follow-up period. About 67% of patients were discharged to their usual residence within 7 days of admission. Two patients tested positive for COVID-19 postoperatively, but none required Intensive Care Unit admission.
Conclusion
Joint replacement arthroplasty can be undertaken safely with diligent patient selection, application of a stringent COVID appropriate behaviour and a ‘ring-fenced’ peri-operative pathway.

AB  - Background
During the first wave of COVID-19 it was hypothesized that COVID-19 is subject to multi-wave seasonality, similar to Influenza-Like Illnesses since time immemorial. One year into the pandemic, we aimed to test the seasonality hypothesis for COVID-19.
Methods
We calculated the average annual time-series for Influenza-Like Illnesses based on incidence data from 2016 till 2019 in the Netherlands, and compared these with two COVID-19 time-series during 2020/2021 for the Netherlands. We plotted the time-series on a standardized logarithmic infection scale. Finally, we calculated correlation coefficients and used univariate regression analysis to estimate the strength of the association between the time-series of COVID-19 and Influenza-Like Illnesses.
Results
The time-series for COVID-19 and Influenza-Like Illnesses were strongly and highly significantly correlated. The COVID-19 peaks were all during flu season, and lows were all in the opposing period. Finally, COVID-19 meets the multi-wave characteristics of earlier flu-like pandemics, namely a short first wave at the tail-end of a flu season, and a longer and more intense second wave during the subsequent flu season.
Conclusions
We conclude that seasonal patterns of COVID-19 incidence and Influenza-Like Illnesses incidence are highly similar, in a country in the temperate climate zone, such as the Netherlands. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic satisfies the criteria of earlier respiratory pandemics, namely a first wave that is short-lived at the tail-end of flu season, and a second wave that is longer and more severe. This seems to imply that the same factors that are driving the seasonality of Influenza-Like Illnesses are causing COVID-19 seasonality as well, such as solar radiation (UV), temperature, relative humidity, and subsequently seasonal allergens and allergies.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease that has reached pandemic status by rapidly spreading worldwide. Elderly individuals and patients with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension show a higher risk of hospitalization, severe disease, and mortality by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. These patients frequently show exacerbated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines associated with an overreaction of the immune system, the so-called cytokine storm. Host nutritional status plays a pivotal role in the outcome of a variety of different infectious diseases. It is known that the immune system is highly affected by malnutrition, leading to decreased immune responses with consequent augmented risk of infection and disease severity. Body composition, especially low lean mass and high adiposity, has consistently been linked to worsened prognosis in many different diseases. In this review, evidence concerning the impact of nutritional status on viral infection outcomes is discussed.

AB  - Purpose
To assess the association between BNT162b2 mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine and the risk of active noninfectious uveitis (NIU).
Design
Retrospective, population-based study.
Participants
Two million six hundred two thousand five hundred fifty-seven people who received the first vaccine dose between December 20, 2020, and April 30, 2021, and 2 441 719 people who received the second vaccine dose between January 10, 2021, and April 30, 2021.
Methods
Events of active NIU were included if they occurred within 21 days after either vaccine dose. Active NIU was defined as newly active or worsening ocular inflammation requiring initiation or increase in local or systemic corticosteroids. Observed cases were compared with the expected number, based on the experience of the population in 2019.
Main Outcome Measures
Age- and sex-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and attributable risks after BNT126b2 vaccination.
Results
Overall, 100 and 88 events of active NIU were recorded within 21 days after the first and second vaccine doses, respectively. Using the experience of the population in 2019 as a reference, after the first dose, the estimated age- and sex-adjusted SIR was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15–1.71) along with a 21-day attributable risk of 1.12 cases per 100 000 vaccinees. After the second dose, the SIR was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.05–1.62), with an estimated attributable risk of 0.86 cases per 100 000 vaccinees. Anterior uveitis was the most common site of inflammation, occurring in 90.96% of eyes, and idiopathic uveitis was the most common cause (56.38%).
Conclusions
This study suggests that the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may be associated with an increased risk of active NIU. However, considering the small effect size and study limitations, this study does not provide proof for a cause-and-effect relationship. The small estimated attributable risks suggest that the impact on public health is relatively minor.

AB  - After five waves of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks, it has been recognized that a significant portion of the affected individuals developed long-term debilitating symptoms marked by chronic fatigue, cognitive difficulties (“brain fog”), post-exertional malaise, and autonomic dysfunction. The onset, progression, and clinical presentation of this condition, generically named post-COVID-19 syndrome, overlap significantly with another enigmatic condition, referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Several pathobiological mechanisms have been proposed for ME/CFS, including redox imbalance, systemic and central nervous system inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Chronic inflammation and glial pathological reactivity are common hallmarks of several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders and have been consistently associated with reduced central and peripheral levels of plasmalogens, one of the major phospholipid components of cell membranes with several homeostatic functions. Of great interest, recent evidence revealed a significant reduction of plasmalogen contents, biosynthesis, and metabolism in ME/CFS and acute COVID-19, with a strong association to symptom severity and other relevant clinical outcomes. These bioactive lipids have increasingly attracted attention due to their reduced levels representing a common pathophysiological manifestation between several disorders associated with aging and chronic inflammation. However, alterations in plasmalogen levels or their lipidic metabolism have not yet been examined in individuals suffering from post-COVID-19 symptoms. Here, we proposed a pathobiological model for post-COVID-19 and ME/CFS based on their common inflammation and dysfunctional glial reactivity, and highlighted the emerging implications of plasmalogen deficiency in the underlying mechanisms. Along with the promising outcomes of plasmalogen replacement therapy (PRT) for various neurodegenerative/neuropsychiatric disorders, we sought to propose PRT as a simple, effective, and safe strategy for the potential relief of the debilitating symptoms associated with ME/CFS and post-COVID-19 syndrome.

AB  - There has been an increase in the outbreak of communicable diseases in recent times; the most recent ones are Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) and COVID-19. These diseases have had different impacts on society and the ecosystem. However, underlying these impacts are the levels of preparedness of governments and public health institutions to mitigate and control these diseases. Therefore, this paper aims to explore these impacts, government and institutional interventions and their nexus towards the effective management of such crises. A critical review of empirical literature was adopted for the methodological approach and narrative synthesis used for analysis. Results show that EVD had diverse impacts on West Africa; economically through the loss of income from economic activities due to widespread sickness among workers and movement restrictions. EVD also had significant social impacts, such as reduced community cohesion, school and business closures, job losses, food insecurity, and high morbidity and mortality. Though some good efforts have been made by different countries in collaboration with international organisations like the World Health Organization to control disease outbreaks more effectively, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has however exposed major weaknesses in the capacity of most African countries to cope. Poor capacity for testing and treatment, inadequate health facilities, poor incentives for health care workers, poor governance systems, poor border control, and awareness and research capacities impacted negatively on the capacity to control disease outbreaks. There is, therefore, a need to strengthen health systems across Africa through improved resource mobilisation, staff training, and coordination of investment strategies to sustain health system preparedness to manage future emerging or re-emerging outbreaks.

AB  - It is essential to evaluate patient outcomes at an early stage when dealing with a pandemic to provide optimal clinical care and resource management. Many methods have been proposed to provide a roadmap against different pandemics, including the recent pandemic disease COVID-19. Due to recurrent epidemic waves of COVID-19, which have been observed in many countries, mathematical modeling and forecasting of COVID-19 are still necessary as long as the world continues to battle against the pandemic. Modeling may aid in determining which interventions to try or predict future growth patterns. In this article, we design a combined approach for analyzing any pandemic in two separate parts. In the first part of the paper, we develop a recurrent SEIRS compartmental model to predict recurrent outbreak patterns of diseases. Due to its time-varying parameters, our model is able to reflect the dynamics of infectious diseases, and to measure the effectiveness of the restrictive measures. We discuss the stable solutions of the corresponding autonomous system with frozen parameters. We focus on the regime shifts and tipping points; then we investigate tipping phenomena due to parameter drifts in our time-varying parameters model that exhibits a bifurcation in the frozen-in case. Furthermore, we propose an optimal numerical design for estimating the system’s parameters. In the second part, we introduce machine learning models to strengthen the methodology of our paper in data analysis, particularly for prediction scenarios. We use MLP, RBF, LSTM, ANFIS, and GRNN for training and evaluation of COVID-19. Then, we compare the results with the recurrent dynamical system in the fitting process and prediction scenario. We also confirm results by implementing our methods on the released data on COVID-19 by WHO for Italy, Germany, Iran, and South Africa between 1/22/2020 and 7/24/2021, when people were engaged with different variants including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. The results of this article show that the dynamic model is adequate for long-term analysis and data fitting, as well as obtaining parameters affecting the epidemic. However, it is ineffective in providing a long-term forecast. In contrast machine learning methods effectively provide disease prediction, although they do not provide analysis such as dynamic models. Finally, some metrics, including RMSE, R-Squared, and accuracy, are used to evaluate the machine learning models. These metrics confirm that ANFIS and RBF perform better than other methods in training and testing zones.

KW  - Myth
AB  - Background
Among all of the studied potential causes of autism, vaccines have received some of the most scrutiny and have been the topic of many evidence-based studies. These efforts have led the great majority of scientists, physicians, and public health researchers to refute causation between vaccines and autism.
Rationale
This presumed association and concern has been a major contributor to parents’ refusal to immunize their children and has become a major threat to public health in secluded populations over the last two decades, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the emergence of COVID-19 immunizations, sentiments towards this topic were addressed as a public health concern that may influence the ability to overcome the Corona virus worldwide.
Scientific review of data
Despite the overwhelming data demonstrating that there is no link between vaccines and autism, many parents are hesitant to immunize their children because of the alleged association. Other contributing factors to the myths and conspiracy theories surrounding the association between vaccines and autism include the fact that the diagnosis of autism is typically made after the age of receiving the main childhood immunizations, as well as the occasional occurrence of regression after the age of first year vaccinations. In spite of vast evidence that the main contribution to the increase in incidence is from improvement of the diagnostic process, this rapid and publicized rise in autism diagnoses feeds parental concerns regarding any medical intervention that may be associated with the health of their children.
Recommendations
It is plausible that with more evidence-based studies linking autism to specific etiologies the myth will diminish and disappear eventually. In an era where conspiracy theories are prevalent on social media, it is critical that evidence-based studies relating autism to specific etiologies be made public, and that information concerning autism diagnosis and causes be made more readily available through social media and parental organizations.

KW  - COVID therapy
AB  - Background and purpose
The ability of low dose radiotherapy (LDRT) to control the unprecedented cytokine release associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis has been an area of widespread research since the COVID pandemic. It has not been studied adequately whether the anti-inflammatory effect of LDRT provides additional benefit when used concurrently with steroids amongst other standard pharmacologic therapy.
Material and methods
51 RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients were recruited between November 2020 and July 2021. 34 patients were allotted to receive 0.5 Gy single session LDRT along with standard pharmacologic therapy while 17 patients received standard pharmacologic therapy alone. All had SpO2 <94% on room air, respiratory frequency >24/min and SpO2/FiO2 (SF) ratio between >89 but <357. All patients underwent a baseline CT scan. They were followed up for 28 days during when serial SF ratio, blood biomarkers (CRP, Serum ferritin, IL-6), Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), repeat CT scan were performed at pre-defined time points.
Results
LDRT showed a statistically significant early improvement in oxygenation, an early time to clinical recovery, early hospital discharge and better radiological resolution compared to control group. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to ALC or blood biomarkers at any of the measured time points. The 28-day mortality rate did not show statistically significant difference between the two groups.
Conclusion
LDRT can be considered for selected oxygen-dependent moderate to severe COVID-19 patients for rapid relief of respiratory distress. It can be safely combined with standard pharmacologic treatment in such patients for added clinical benefit.

AB  - Background
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted health care access across Canada with the reduction in in-person evaluations. The aim of the study was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to health care services among the Canadian population with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD).
Methods
All Canadian adult congenital heart affiliated centres were contacted and asked to collect data on outpatient clinic and procedural volumes for the 2019 and 2020 calendar years. A survey was sent detailing questions on clinic and procedural volumes and wait times before and after pandemic restrictions. Descriptive statistics were used with the Student t-test to compare groups.
Results
In 2019, there were 19,326 ACHD clinic visits across Canada and only 296 (1.5%) virtual clinic visits. However, during the first year of the pandemic, there were 20,532 clinic visits and 11,412 (56%) virtual visits (P < 0.0001). There were no differences in procedural volumes (electrophysiology, cardiac surgery, and percutaneous intervention) between 2019 and 2020. The mean estimated wait times (months) before the pandemic vs the pandemic were as follows: nonurgent consult 5.4 ± 2.6 vs 6.6 ± 4.2 (P = 0.65), ACHD surgery 6.0 ± 3.5 vs 7.0 ± 4.6 (P = 0.47), electrophysiology procedures 6.3 ± 3.3 vs 5.7 ± 3.3 (P = 0.72), and percutaneous intervention 4.6 ± 3.9 vs 4.4 ± 2.3 (P = 0.74).
Conclusions
During the pandemic and restrictions of social distancing, the use of virtual clinic visits helped to maintain continuity in ACHD clinical care, with 56% of ACHD visits being virtual. The procedural volumes and wait times for consultation and percutaneous and surgical interventions were not delayed.
Résumé
Contexte
La pandémie de COVID-19 a eu des répercussions sur l’accès aux soins de santé partout au Canada, y compris une diminution des évaluations en personne. La présente étude visait à évaluer l’effet de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur l’accès aux soins de santé chez les adultes atteints de cardiopathie congénitale.
Méthodologie
Nous avons communiqué avec tous les centres canadiens de prise en charge de la cardiopathie congénitale chez l’adulte et nous leur avons demandé de recueillir des données sur les consultations externes et le volume des interventions pour les années 2019 et 2020. Un sondage détaillé leur a été transmis sur les volumes de consultations et d’interventions et sur les temps d’attentes avant et après la mise en place de restrictions liées à la pandémie. Les groupes ont été comparés lors d’une analyse statistique descriptive utilisant le test t de Student.
Résultats
En 2019, 19 326 consultations pour cause de cardiopathie congénitale chez l’vadulte ont été enregistrées au Canada, dont seulement 296 (1,5 %) ont eu lieu en mode virtuel. Au cours de la première année de la pandémie, 20 532 consultations ont été relevées; 11 412 (56 %) ont été menées virtuellement (p < 0,0001). Aucune différence n’a été observée dans le volume d’interventions (interventions en électrophysiologie, interventions chirurgicales et interventions percutanées) entre 2019 et 2020. Les temps d’attente moyens estimés en mois, avant et pendant la pandémie, étaient les suivants : consultations non urgentes, 5,4 ± 2,6 vs 6,6 ± 4,2 (p = 0,65); interventions chirurgicales, 6,0 ± 3,5 vs 7,0 ± 4,6 (p = 0,47); interventions en électrophysiologie, 6,3 ± 3,3 vs 5,7 ± 3,3 (p = 0,72); et interventions percutanées, 4,6 ± 3,9 vs 4,4 ± 2,3 (p = 0,74).
Conclusion
Au cours de la pandémie et de la période où les restrictions de distanciation sociale étaient en vigueur, le recours aux consultations virtuelles dans les cliniques a contribué à la continuité des soins offerts aux adultes atteints de cardiopathie congénitale, puisque 56 % des visites se sont déroulées virtuellement. Le volume d’interventions n’a pas été touché et les temps d’attentes pour les consultations, les interventions percutanées et les interventions chirurgicales ne se sont pas allongés.

AB  - Summary
Background
Workplaces are an important potential source of SARS-CoV-2 exposure; however, investigation into workplace contact patterns is lacking. This study aimed to investigate how workplace attendance and features of contact varied between occupations across the COVID-19 pandemic in England.
Methods
Data were obtained from electronic contact diaries (November 2020-November 2021) submitted by employed/self-employed prospective cohort study participants (n=4,616). We used mixed models to investigate the effects of occupation and time for: workplace attendance, number of people sharing workspace, time spent sharing workspace, number of close contacts, and usage of face coverings.
Findings
Workplace attendance and contact patterns varied across occupations and time. The predicted probability of intense space sharing during the day was highest for healthcare (78% [95% CI: 75–81%]) and education workers (64% [59%–69%]), who also had the highest probabilities for larger numbers of close contacts (36% [32%–40%] and 38% [33%–43%] respectively). Education workers also demonstrated relatively low predicted probability (51% [44%–57%]) of wearing a face covering during close contact. Across all occupational groups, workspace sharing and close contact increased and usage of face coverings decreased during phases of less stringent restrictions.
Interpretation
Major variations in workplace contact patterns and mask use likely contribute to differential COVID-19 risk. Patterns of variation by occupation and restriction phase may inform interventions for future waves of COVID-19 or other respiratory epidemics. Across occupations, increasing workplace contact and reduced face covering usage is concerning given ongoing high levels of community transmission and emergence of variants.

AB  - Summary
The high prevalence of obesity and obesity-related comorbidities has reached pandemic proportions, particularly in Western countries. Obesity increases the risk to develop several chronic noncommunicable disease, ultimately contributing to reduced survival. Recently, obesity has been recognized as major risk factor for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)-related prognosis, contributing to worse outcomes in those with established COVID-19. Particularly, obesity has been associated with higher hospitalization rates in acute or intensive care and greater risk for invasive mechanical ventilation than lean people. Obesity is characterized by metabolic impairments and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation that causes a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, further aggravating the cytokine production and risk of cytokine storm response during Sars-Cov2 sepsis or other secondary infections. Moreover, the metabolic dysregulations are closely related to an impaired immune system and altered response to viral infection that can ultimately lead to a greater susceptibility to infections, longer viral shedding and greater duration of illness and severity of the disease. In individuals with obesity, maintaining a healthy diet, remaining physically active and reducing sedentary behaviors are particularly important during COVID-19-related quarantine to reduce metabolic and immune impairments. Moreover, such stategies are of utmost importance to reduce the risk for sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity, and to prevent a reduction and potentially even increase cardiorespiratory fitness, a well-known independent risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and recently found to be a risk factor also for hospitalizations secondary to COVID-19. Such lifestyle strategies may ultimately reduce morbility and mortality in patients with infectious disease, especially in those with concomitant obesity. The aim of this review is to discuss how obesity might increase the risk of COVID-19 and potentially affect its prognosis once COVID-19 is diagnosed. We therefore advocate for implementation of strategies aimed at preventing obesity in the first place, but also to minimize the metabolic anomalies that may lead to a compromized immune response and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, especially in patients with COVID-19.
