AB  - Black Americans have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 but have comparatively low vaccination rates, creating a need for vaccine messaging strategies that are tailored to this population. We conducted an experimental study to examine the effects of three messaging strategies on Black Americans’ reported willingness to receive the vaccine and vaccine hesitancy. We also recruited White and Hispanic Americans to assess any potential backfire effects of the tailored strategies for non-Black participants. A total of 739 participants completed the study. Results from 4x2 ANCOVAs indicate that, among Black participants, messaging that acknowledged past unethical treatment of Black Americans in medical research and emphasized current safeguards to prevent medical mistreatment was associated with significantly less vaccine hesitancy than the control condition. The same effects were not observed for messaging strategies that provided general safety information about the vaccine or that emphasized the role of the vaccine in reducing racial inequities. There were no significant differences across conditions for participants of other races. Results demonstrate that public health messages tailored to address specific vaccine concerns may aid future vaccination campaigns.

AB  - Recently, the COVID-19 disease spread has emerged as a worldwide pandemic and cause severe threats to humanity. The World Health Organisation (WHO) releases guidelines to help the countries to reduce the spread of this virus to the public, like wearing masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, shutting down all types of public transports, etc. These conditions led to a worldwide economic fall drastically, and on the other hand, indirect environmental benefits like global air quality improvement and decreased water pollution are also pictured. Currently, use of face masks is part of a comprehensive package of the prevention and control measures that can limit the spread of COVID-19 since there is no clinically proven drugs or vaccine available for COVID-19. Mostly, face masks are made of petroleum-based non-renewable polymers that are non-biodegradable, hazardous to the environment and create health issues. This study demonstrates the extensive use of the face mask and how it affects human health and the marine ecosystem. It has become a great challenge for the government sectors to impose strict regulations for the proper disposal of the masks as medical waste by the public. Neglecting the seriousness of this issue may lead to the release of large tonnes of micro-plastics to the landfill as well as to the marine environment where mostly end-up and thereby affecting their fauna and flora population vastly. Besides, this study highlights the COVID-19 spread, its evolutionary importance, taxonomy, genomic structure, transmission to humans, prevention, and treatment.

AB  - Summary
Background
Influenza virus infection is associated with incident ischemic heart disease (IHD) events. Here, we estimate the global, regional, and national IHD mortality burden attributable to influenza.
Methods
We used vital registration data from deaths in adults ≥50 years (13.2 million IHD deaths as underlying cause) to assess the relationship between influenza activity and IHD mortality in a non-linear meta-regression framework from 2010 to 2019. This derived relationship was then used to estimate the global influenza attributable IHD mortality. We estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of influenza for IHD deaths based on the relative risk associated with a given level of weekly influenza test positivity rate and multiplied PAFs by IHD mortality from the Global Burden of Disease study.
Findings
Influenza activity was associated with increased risk of IHD mortality across all countries analyzed. The mean PAF of influenza for IHD mortality was 3.9% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2.5–5.3%), ranging from <1% to 10%, depending on country and year. Globally, 299,858 IHD deaths (95% UI 191,216–406,809) in adults ≥50 years could be attributed to influenza, with the highest rates per 100,000 population in the Central Europe, Eastern Europe and Central Asia Region (32.3; 95% UI 20.6–43.8), and in the North Africa and Middle East Region (26.7; 95% UI 17–36.2).
Interpretation
Influenza may contribute substantially to the burden of IHD. Our results suggest that if there were no influenza, an average of 4% of IHD deaths globally would not occur.

AB  - SARS-Cov2 is currently causing a persistent Covid-19 pandemic, which poses a risk of causing long-term cardiovascular sequels in the population. The viral mechanism of cell infection through the angiotensin 2 converter enzyme receptor and the limited antiviral innate immune response are the suspected causes for a more frequent cardiovascular damage in SARS-Cov2 infection. Knowledge of: the appearance during acute infection of other cardiac conditions beyond the classical myocarditis and pericarditis), the long-term cardiac manifestations (persistent Covid-19), and the increased incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination; it is of special interest in order to offer our patients best practices based on current scientific evidence.
Resumen
El SARS-Cov2 está causando actualmente una pandemia sostenida de Covid-19, con el riesgo de causar secuelas cardíacas a largo plazo en la población. El temor que el SARS-Cov2 cause un daño miocárdico mayor que otros virus convencionales se basa en su mecanismo de infección de células humanas a través del receptor de la enzima convertidora de la angiotensina 2 y las defensas antivirales innatas hasta ahora reducidas contra un nuevo virus. El conocimiento de: la aparición durante la infección aguda de otras afectaciones cardiacas además de las clásicas miocarditis y pericarditis, las manifestaciones cardiacas observadas a largo plazo (Covid-19 persistente) y, la incidencia incrementada de miocarditis y pericarditis tras la vacunación; resulta de especial interés a fin de ofrecer a nuestros pacientes la mejor atención posible basada en la evidencia científica actual.

AB  - Summary
Background
Estimates of immunity and severity for the SARS-CoV-2 omicron subvariant BA.5 are important to assess the public health impact associated with its rapid global spread despite vaccination. We estimated natural and vaccine immunity and severity of BA.5 relative to BA.2 in Denmark, a country with high mRNA-vaccination coverage and free-of-charge RT-PCR testing.
Methods
This nation-wide population-based study in Denmark included residents aged 18 years or older who had taken an RT-PCR test between 10 April and 30 June, 2022 (ie, the outcome period), and who the national COVID-19 surveillance system identified as having information since February 2020 on RT-PCR tests, whole-genome sequencing, vaccinations, and hospitalisation with a positive RT-PCR test and COVID-19 as the main diagnosis. First, we used a case–control design, in which cases were people infected with BA.5 or BA.2 during the outcome period and controls were people who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection during the outcome period. We calculated the protection provided by a previous PCR-confirmed omicron infection against BA.5 and BA.2 infection and hospitalisation among triple-vaccinated individuals. Second, we compared vaccination status in people infected with BA.5 versus BA.2 and estimated relative vaccine protection against each subvariant. Third, we compared rates of hospitalisation for COVID-19 among people infected with BA.5 versus BA.2. We estimated effects using logistic regression with adjustment for sex, age, region, PCR-test date, comorbidity and, as appropriate, vaccination and previous infection status.
Findings
A total of 210 (2·4%) of 8678 of BA.5 cases, 192 (0·7%) of 29 292 of BA.2 cases, and 33 972 (19·0%) of 178 669 PCR-negative controls previously had an omicron infection, which was estimated in the adjusted analyses to offer 92·7% (95% CI 91·6–93·7) protection against BA.5 infection and 97·1% (96·6–97·5) protection against BA.2 infection. We found similarly high amounts of protection against hospitalisation owing to infection with BA.5 (96·4% [95% CI 74·2–99·5]) and BA.2 (91·2% [76·3–96·7]). Vaccine coverage (three mRNA doses vs none) was 9307 (94·2%) of 9878 among BA.5 cases and 30 581 (94·8%) of 32 272 among BA.2 cases, although in the adjusted analysis, there was a trend towards slightly higher vaccination coverage among BA.5 cases than BA.2 cases (OR 1·18 [95% CI 0·99–1·42]; p=0·064), possibly suggesting marginally poorer vaccine protection against BA.5. The rate of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 was higher among the BA.5 cases (210 [1·9%] of 11 314) than among the BA.2 cases (514 [1·4%] of 36 805), with an OR of 1·34 (95% CI 1·14–1·57) and an adjusted OR of 1·69 (95% CI 1·22–2·33), despite low and stable COVID-19 hospitalisation numbers during the study period.
Interpretation
The study provides evidence that a previous omicron infection in triple-vaccinated individuals provides high amounts of protection against BA.5 and BA.2 infections. However, protection estimates greater than 90% might be too high if individuals with a previous infection were more likely than those without one to come forward for a test for reasons other than suspicion of COVID-19. Our analysis also showed that vaccine protection against BA.5 infection was similar to, or slightly weaker than, protection against BA.2 infection. Finally, there was evidence that BA.5 infections were associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation compared with BA.2 infections.

AB  - Summary
Background
The literature on first generation COVID-19 vaccines show they were less effective against new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern including Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants). New vaccines developed against variant strains may provide cross-protection against emerging variants when used as boosters and facilitate vaccination across a range of countries, healthcare settings and populations. However, there are no data on such vaccines when used as a primary series.
Methods
A global Phase 3, multi-stage efficacy study (NCT04904549) among adults (≥18 years) was conducted in 53 research centres in eight countries (United States, Honduras, Japan, Colombia, Kenya, India, Ghana, Nepal). Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive two intramuscular injections of a monovalent SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein vaccine with AS03-adjuvant (10 μg of the spike (S) protein from the ancestral D614 strain) or placebo on Day 1 (D01) and Day 22 (D22). The primary efficacy endpoint was prevention of virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with symptoms of COVID-19-like illness (CLI) ≥14 days after the second injection (post-dose 2 [PD2]) in participants who were SARS-CoV-2 naïve on D01 + D22. Safety and reactogenicity were also evaluated.
Findings
Between May 26 and November 7, 2021, 10,114 participants received ≥1 study injection, and 9441 participants received both injections. 2108 (20.8%) participants were SARS-CoV-2 naïve at D01 and D22. The primary endpoint was analysed in a subset of the full analysis set (the modified full analysis set PD2 [mFAS-PD2], excluding participants who did not complete the vaccination schedule or received vaccination despite meeting one of the contraindication criteria, had onset of symptomatic COVID-19 between the first injection and before 14 days after the second injection, or participants who discontinued before 14 days after the second injection [n = 9377; vaccine, n = 4702; placebo, n = 4675]). Data were available for 2051 SARS-CoV-2 naïve and 7159 non-naïve participants. At the cut-off date (January 28, 2022), symptomatic COVID-19 was reported in 169 naïve participants (vaccine, n = 81; placebo, n = 88) ≥14 days PD2, with a vaccine efficacy (VE) of 15.3% (95% CI, −15.8; 38.2). VE regardless of D01/D22 serostatus was 32.9% (95% CI, 15.3; 47.0) and VE in non-naïve participants was 52.7% (95% CI, 31.2; 67.9). Viral genome sequencing was performed up to the data cut-off point and identified the infecting strain in 99/169 adjudicated cases in the PD2 naïve population (Delta [25], Omicron [72], other variants [3], one participant had infection with both Delta and Omicron variants and has been included in the totals for both Delta and Omicron). The vaccine was well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile.
Interpretation
In the context of changing circulating viral variants, it is challenging to induce protection in naïve individuals with a two-dose priming schedule based on the parental D614 strain. However, while the primary endpoint of this trial was not met, the results show that a monovalent D614 vaccine can still be of value in individuals previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Summary
SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells will likely prove critical for long-term immune protection against COVID-19. Here, we systematically mapped the functional and phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in unexposed individuals, exposed family members, and individuals with acute or convalescent COVID-19. Acute-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a highly activated cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical markers of disease severity, whereas convalescent-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were polyfunctional and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative exposed family members and convalescent individuals with a history of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits broadly directed and functionally replete memory T cell responses, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19.

AB  - Background
The normal ageing process is accompanied by immunosenescence and a progressive weakening of the immune system. High-dose inactivated influenza quadrivalent vaccine (HD-QIV) has shown greater immunogenicity, relative efficacy, and effectiveness than the standard-dose inactivated quadrivalent vaccine (SD-QIV). The aim of the study was to assess the cost-utility of an HD-QIV strategy compared with an adjuvanted trivalent inactivated vaccine (aTIV) strategy in the population above 65 years of age in Spain.
Methods
We evaluated the public health and economic benefits of alternatives by using a decision-tree model, which included influenza cases, visits to the general practitioner (GP), visits to the emergency department (ED), hospitalisations, and mortality related to influenza. We performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to account for both epidemiological and economical sources of uncertainty.
Results
Our results show that switching from aTIV strategy to HD-QIV would prevent 36,476 cases of influenza, 5,143 visits to GP, 1,054 visits to the ED, 9,193 episodes of hospitalisation due to influenza or pneumonia, and 357 deaths due to influenza – increasing 3,514 life-years and 3,167 quality–adjusted life–years (QALYs). Healthcare costs increase by €78,874,301, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €24,353/QALY. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the results are rather robust.
Conclusion
Our analysis shows that HD-QIV in people over 65 years of age is an influenza-prevention strategy that is at least cost-effective, if not dominant, in Spain. It reduces cases of influenza, GP visits, hospitalisations, deaths, and associated healthcare costs.

AB  - Objective
The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing health disparities. To provide a historical perspective on health disparities for pandemic acute respiratory viruses, we conducted a scoping review of the public health literature of health disparities in influenza outcomes during the 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 influenza pandemics.
Methods
We searched for articles examining socioeconomic or racial/ethnic disparities in any population, examining any influenza-related outcome (e.g., incidence, hospitalizations, mortality), during the 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 influenza pandemics. We conducted a structured search of English-written articles in PubMed supplemented by a snowball of articles meeting inclusion criteria.
Results
A total of 29 articles met inclusion criteria, all but one focusing exclusively on the 1918 or 2009 pandemics. Individuals of low socioeconomic status, or living in low socioeconomic status areas, experienced higher incidence, hospitalizations, and mortality in the 1918 and 2009 pandemics. There were conflicting results regarding racial/ethnic disparities during the 1918 pandemic, with differences in magnitude and direction by outcome, potentially due to issues in data quality by race/ethnicity. Racial/ethnic minorities had generally higher incidence, mortality, and hospitalization rates in the 1957 and 2009 pandemics.
Conclusion
Individuals of low socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic minorities have historically experienced worse influenza outcomes during pandemics. These historical patterns can inform current research to understand disparities in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.

AB  - Summary
Background
COVID-19 is associated with increased risks of neurological and psychiatric sequelae in the weeks and months thereafter. How long these risks remain, whether they affect children and adults similarly, and whether SARS-CoV-2 variants differ in their risk profiles remains unclear.
Methods
In this analysis of 2-year retrospective cohort studies, we extracted data from the TriNetX electronic health records network, an international network of de-identified data from health-care records of approximately 89 million patients collected from hospital, primary care, and specialist providers (mostly from the USA, but also from Australia, the UK, Spain, Bulgaria, India, Malaysia, and Taiwan). A cohort of patients of any age with COVID-19 diagnosed between Jan 20, 2020, and April 13, 2022, was identified and propensity-score matched (1:1) to a contemporaneous cohort of patients with any other respiratory infection. Matching was done on the basis of demographic factors, risk factors for COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 illness, and vaccination status. Analyses were stratified by age group (age <18 years [children], 18–64 years [adults], and ≥65 years [older adults]) and date of diagnosis. We assessed the risks of 14 neurological and psychiatric diagnoses after SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared these risks with the matched comparator cohort. The 2-year risk trajectories were represented by time-varying hazard ratios (HRs) and summarised using the 6-month constant HRs (representing the risks in the earlier phase of follow-up, which have not yet been well characterised in children), the risk horizon for each outcome (ie, the time at which the HR returns to 1), and the time to equal incidence in the two cohorts. We also estimated how many people died after a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis during follow-up in each age group. Finally, we compared matched cohorts of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 directly before and after the emergence of the alpha (B.1.1.7), delta (B.1.617.2), and omicron (B.1.1.529) variants.
Findings
We identified 1 487 712 patients with a recorded diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study period, of whom 1 284 437 (185 748 children, 856 588 adults, and 242 101 older adults; overall mean age 42·5 years [SD 21·9]; 741 806 [57·8%] were female and 542 192 [42·2%] were male) were adequately matched with an equal number of patients with another respiratory infection. The risk trajectories of outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection in the whole cohort differed substantially. While most outcomes had HRs significantly greater than 1 after 6 months (with the exception of encephalitis; Guillain-Barré syndrome; nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorder; and parkinsonism), their risk horizons and time to equal incidence varied greatly. Risks of the common psychiatric disorders returned to baseline after 1–2 months (mood disorders at 43 days, anxiety disorders at 58 days) and subsequently reached an equal overall incidence to the matched comparison group (mood disorders at 457 days, anxiety disorders at 417 days). By contrast, risks of cognitive deficit (known as brain fog), dementia, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy or seizures were still increased at the end of the 2-year follow-up period. Post-COVID-19 risk trajectories differed in children compared with adults: in the 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, children were not at an increased risk of mood (HR 1·02 [95% CI 0·94–1·10) or anxiety (1·00 [0·94–1·06]) disorders, but did have an increased risk of cognitive deficit, insomnia, intracranial haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke, nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorders, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy or seizures (HRs ranging from 1·20 [1·09–1·33] to 2·16 [1·46–3·19]). Unlike adults, cognitive deficit in children had a finite risk horizon (75 days) and a finite time to equal incidence (491 days). A sizeable proportion of older adults who received a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis, in either cohort, subsequently died, especially those diagnosed with dementia or epilepsy or seizures. Risk profiles were similar just before versus just after the emergence of the alpha variant (n=47 675 in each cohort). Just after (vs just before) the emergence of the delta variant (n=44 835 in each cohort), increased risks of ischaemic stroke, epilepsy or seizures, cognitive deficit, insomnia, and anxiety disorders were observed, compounded by an increased death rate. With omicron (n=39 845 in each cohort), there was a lower death rate than just before emergence of the variant, but the risks of neurological and psychiatric outcomes remained similar.
Interpretation
This analysis of 2-year retrospective cohort studies of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 showed that the increased incidence of mood and anxiety disorders was transient, with no overall excess of these diagnoses compared with other respiratory infections. In contrast, the increased risk of psychotic disorder, cognitive deficit, dementia, and epilepsy or seizures persisted throughout. The differing trajectories suggest a different pathogenesis for these outcomes. Children have a more benign overall profile of psychiatric risk than do adults and older adults, but their sustained higher risk of some diagnoses is of concern. The fact that neurological and psychiatric outcomes were similar during the delta and omicron waves indicates that the burden on the health-care system might continue even with variants that are less severe in other respects. Our findings are relevant to understanding individual-level and population-level risks of neurological and psychiatric disorders after SARS-CoV-2 infection and can help inform our responses to them.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Due to the immediate need for social distancing, as well as widespread disruption in clinical practices, brought on by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) pandemic, medical student education rapidly shifted to a virtual format, which resulted in a variety of innovative and remotely accessible practices to address new restrictions on face-to-face education. Educators approached curriculum design seeking to replicate as much of the in-person experience as possible, and were faced with overcoming the challenges of replacing the innately hands-on nature of surgery with virtual operative and skills experiences. Restrictions on in-person visiting electives expedited the role of virtual education as a notable opportunity for medical student education and recruitment, with a variety of approaches to engaging undergraduate medical learners, including the use of live-streaming operative cases, virtual didactic curricula, and a rise in podcasts; web-based conferences; and virtual journal clubs. In addition to education, virtual outreach to medical students has become an essential tool in trainee recruitment and selection, and ongoing application of novel educational platforms will allow for new opportunities in multi-institutional collaboration and exchange with a multitude of benefits to future vascular surgery trainees. Our aim was to outline the resources and practices used to virtually teach and recruit medical students and the benefits of virtual rotations to the program and students.

AB  - Brief overview
Current evidence suggests that Echinacea supplementation may decrease the duration and severity of acute respiratory tract infections; however, no studies using Echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19 have been identified. Few adverse events were reported, suggesting that this herbal therapy is reasonably safe. Because Echinacea can increase immune function, there is a concern that it could worsen over-activation of the immune system in cytokine storm; however, clinical trials show that Echinacea decreases levels of immune molecules involved in cytokine storm.
Verdict
Echinacea supplementation may assist with the symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ARI) and the common cold, particularly when administered at the first sign of infection; however, no studies using Echinacea in the prevention or treatment of conditions similar to COVID-19 have been identified. Previous studies have reported that Echinacea may decrease the severity and/or duration of ARI when taken at the onset of symptoms. The studies reporting benefit used E. purpurea or a combination of E. purpurea and E. angustifolia containing standardized amounts of active constituents. Few adverse events from the use of Echinacea were reported, suggesting that this herbal therapy is reasonably safe. No human trials could be located reporting evidence of cytokine storm when Echinacea was used for up to 4 months. When assessing all human trials which reported changes in cytokine levels in response to Echinacea supplementation, the results were largely consistent with a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a role in the progression of cytokine storm and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), factors that play a significant role in the death of COVID-19 patients. While there is currently no research on the therapeutic effects of Echinacea in the management of cytokine storm, this evidence suggests that further research is warranted.

AB  - In this chapter, we evaluated the development and impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The evaluation was performed by continent and country. The structure of the weekly mortality curves on all continents is very different from the weekly incidence rate. With the data from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation published in The Lancet, we have calculated the COVID-19 directed and associated mortality rate for 181 countries. Despite the structural similarity between the second, third, and fourth waves being similar, the weekly mortality rate intensity of the four waves was very asynchronous among all the countries. One of the primary consequences of this pandemic is orphanhood. Recently, the Imperial College of London has published a webpage that calculates the number of orphans generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the fact that before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak there was plenty of scientific evidence about how to handle and/or mitigate a pandemic, almost every government adopted different policies with different anti-epidemic effects and impacts.

AB  - Summary
Background
The world is currently experiencing multiple economic crises due to the COVID-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine, and inflation surge, which disproportionately affect children, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We evaluated if the expansion of Social Assistance, represented by Social Pensions (SP) and Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT), could reduce infant and child mortality, and mitigate excess deaths among children in Brazil, one of the LMICs most affected by these economic crises.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective impact evaluation in a cohort of Brazilian municipalities from 2004 to 2019 using multivariable fixed-effects negative binomial models, adjusted for relevant demographic, social, and economic factors, to estimate the effects of the SP and CCT on infant and child mortality. To verify the robustness of the results, we conducted several sensitivity and triangulation analyses, including difference-in-difference with propensity-score matching. These results were incorporated into dynamic microsimulation models to generate projections to 2030 of various economic crises and Social Assistance scenarios.
Findings
Consolidated coverage of SP was associated with significant reductions in infant and child mortality rates, with a rate ratio (RR) of 0.843 (95% CI: 0.826–0.861) and 0.840 (95% CI: 0.824–0.856), respectively. Similarly, CCT consolidated coverages showed RRs of 0.868 (95% CI: 0.842–0.849) and 0.874 (95% CI: 0.850–0.899) for infant and child mortality, respectively. The higher the degree of poverty in the municipalities, the stronger the impact of CCT on reducing child mortality. Given the current economic crisis, a mitigation strategy that will increase the coverage of SP and CCT could avert 148,736 (95% CI: 127,148–170,706) child deaths up to 2030, compared with fiscal austerity measures.
Interpretation
SP and CCT programs could strongly reduce child mortality in LMICs, and their expansion should be considered as an effective strategy to mitigate the impact of the current multiple global economic crises.

AB  - Numerous studies have been conducted worldwide to investigate if an association exists between meteorological factors and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection incidence. Although research studies provide conflicting results, which can be partially explained by different methods used, some clear trends emerge on the role of weather conditions and SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially for temperature and humidity. This study sheds more light on the relationship between meteorological factors and SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence in 23 Italian and 52 Spanish cities. For the purposes of this study, daily air temperature, absolute and relative humidity, wind speed, ultraviolet radiation, and rainfall are considered exposure variables. We conducted a two-stage meta-regression. In the first stage, we estimated the exposure-response association through time series regression analysis at the municipal level. In the second stage, we pooled the association parameters using a meta-analytic model. The study demonstrates an association between meteorological factors and SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence. Specifically, low levels of ambient temperatures and absolute humidity were associated with an increased relative risk. On the other hand, low and high levels of relative humidity and ultraviolet radiation were associated with a decreased relative risk. Concerning wind speed and rainfall, higher values contributed to the reduction of the risk of infection. Overall, our results contribute to a better understanding of how the meteorological factors influence the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and should be considered in a wider context of existing robust literature that highlight the importance of measures such as social distancing, improved hygiene, face masks and vaccination campaign.

AB  - Pneumonia is a common lung infection that causes significant mortality and morbidity worldwide, particularly in children and elderly individuals. The diagnosis is confirmed by radiographic evidence of new consolidation. Pneumonia can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, with the dominant pathogens varying across the globe and between community- or hospital-acquired infections. Bacterial causes are usually acquired by microaspiration of organisms colonizing the nasopharynx. Microbes reaching the distal airways and alveoli induce local and systemic inflammatory responses and can disseminate beyond the lung. Although most cases of pneumonia occur in the community, a significant subset develop in hospital, often caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, which are associated with higher mortality. Microbiological investigations are required to identify the pathogenic organism but lack sensitivity. Severity scoring systems can be used to predict outcome and identify patients who can be safely managed in outpatient settings. The mainstay of treatment is early antibiotics and, if appropriate, supportive therapies such as oxygen and intravenous fluids. Large vaccination programmes have proven effective in reducing the incidence of some of the causative organisms; however, the overall incidence of pneumonia remains high, and further research is required to improve care in at-risk groups such as the elderly.

AB  - Summary
Although the development and clinical application of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated unprecedented vaccine success in a short time frame, it also revealed a limitation of current vaccines in their inability to provide broad-spectrum or universal protection against emerging variants. Broad-spectrum vaccines, therefore, remain a dream and challenge for vaccinology. This review will focus on current and future efforts in developing universal vaccines targeting different viruses at the genus and/or family levels, with a special focus on henipaviruses, influenza viruses, and coronaviruses. It is evident that strategies for developing broad-spectrum vaccines will be virus-genus or family specific, and it is almost impossible to adopt a universal approach for different viruses. On the other hand, efforts in developing broad-spectrum neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been more successful and it is worth considering broad-spectrum antibody-mediated immunization, or “universal antibody vaccine,” as an alternative approach for early intervention for future disease X outbreaks.

AB  - Background and Aims
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has limited endoscopy utilization, causing significant health and economic losses. We aim to model the impact of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing into resuming endoscopy practice.
Methods
We performed a retrospective review of endoscopy utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic for a baseline reference. A computer model compared 3 approaches: strategy 1, endoscopy for urgent indications only; strategy 2, testing for semiurgent indications; and strategy 3, testing all patients. Analysis was made under current COVID-19 prevalence and projected prevalence of 5% and 10%. Primary outcomes were number of procedures performed and/or canceled. Secondary outcomes were direct costs, reimbursement, personal protective equipment used, and personnel infected. Disease prevalence, testing accuracy, and costs were obtained from the literature.
Results
During the COVID-19 pandemic, endoscopy volume was 12.7% of expected. Strategies 2 and 3 were safe and effective interventions to resume endoscopy in semiurgent and elective cases. Investing 22 U.S. dollars (USD) and 105 USD in testing per patient allowed the completion of 19.4% and 95.3% of baseline endoscopies, respectively. False-negative results were seen after testing 4700 patients (or 3 months of applying strategy 2 in our practice). Implementing PCR testing over 1 week in the United States would require 13 and 64 million USD, with a return of 165 and 767 million USD to providers, leaving 65 and 325 healthcare workers infected.
Conclusions
PCR testing is an effective strategy to restart endoscopic practice in the United States. PCR screening should be implemented during the second phase of the pandemic, once the healthcare system is able to test and isolate all suspected COVID-19 cases.

AB  - Background
There are growing concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. With government-imposed restrictions as well as a general burden on healthcare systems, the pandemic has the potential to disrupt the access to, and delivery of, mental healthcare.
Methods
Electronic healthcare records from primary care psychological therapy services (Improving Access to Psychological Therapy) in England were used to examine changes in access to mental health services and service delivery during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive time series was conducted using data from five NHS trusts to examine patterns in referrals to services (1st January 2019 to 24th May 2020) and appointments (1st January 2020 to 24th May 2020) taking place.
Findings
The number of patients accessing mental health services dropped by an average of 55% in the early weeks after the March 2020 lockdown was announced, reaching a maximum reduction of 74% in the initial 3 weeks after lockdown in the UK, which gradually recovered to a 28% reduction by May. We found some evidence suggesting changes in the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of referrals. Despite a reduction in access, the impact on appointments appeared limited with service providers shifting to remote delivery of care.
Interpretation
Services appeared to adapt to provide continuity of care in mental healthcare. However, patients accessing services reduced, potentially placing a future burden on service. Despite the observational nature of the data, the present study can inform the planning of service provision and policy.

These data along with an age-dependent disease susceptibility and mortality in the elderly suggest that sex hormones are the main factors in determining the clinical course of the infection. The differences in aging males versus females and the role of sex hormones in key phenotypes of COVID-19 infection are described in this review. Recommendations based on a dimorphic approach for males and females suggest a sex-specific management the disease.

AB  - Summary
Background
We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) in health-care workers in South Africa during two waves of the South African COVID-19 epidemic.
Methods
In the single-arm, open-label, phase 3B implementation Sisonke study, health-care workers aged 18 years and older were invited for vaccination at one of 122 vaccination sites nationally. Participants received a single dose of 5 × 1010 viral particles of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Vaccinated participants were linked with their person-level data from one of two national medical insurance schemes (scheme A and scheme B) and matched for COVID-19 risk with an unvaccinated member of the general population. The primary outcome was vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19, defined as COVID-19-related admission to hospital, hospitalisation requiring critical or intensive care, or death, in health-care workers compared with the general population, ascertained 28 days or more after vaccination or matching, up to data cutoff. This study is registered with the South African National Clinical Trial Registry, DOH-27-022021-6844, ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04838795, and the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, PACTR202102855526180, and is closed to accrual.
Findings
Between Feb 17 and May 17, 2021, 477 102 health-care workers were enrolled and vaccinated, of whom 357 401 (74·9%) were female and 119 701 (25·1%) were male, with a median age of 42·0 years (33·0–51·0). 215 813 vaccinated individuals were matched with 215 813 unvaccinated individuals. As of data cutoff (July 17, 2021), vaccine effectiveness derived from the total matched cohort was 83% (95% CI 75–89) to prevent COVID-19-related deaths, 75% (69–82) to prevent COVID-19-related hospital admissions requiring critical or intensive care, and 67% (62–71) to prevent COVID-19-related hospitalisations. The vaccine effectiveness for all three outcomes were consistent across scheme A and scheme B. The vaccine effectiveness was maintained in older health-care workers and those with comorbidities including HIV infection. During the course of the study, the beta (B.1.351) and then the delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns were dominant, and vaccine effectiveness remained consistent (for scheme A plus B vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related hospital admission during beta wave was 62% [95% CI 42–76] and during delta wave was 67% [62–71], and vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related death during beta wave was 86% [57–100] and during delta wave was 82% [74–89]).
Interpretation
The single-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine shows effectiveness against severe COVID-19 disease and COVID-19-related death after vaccination, and against both beta and delta variants, providing real-world evidence for its use globally.

AB  - The viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 has increased the mortality rate and engaged several adverse effects on the affected individuals. Currently available antiviral drugs have found to be unsuccessful in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The demand for efficient antiviral drugs has created a huge burden on physicians and health workers. Plasma therapy seems to be less accomplishable due to insufficient donors to donate plasma and low recovery rate from viral infection. Repurposing of antivirals has been evolved as a suitable strategy in the current treatment and preventive measures. The concept of drug repurposing represents new experimental approaches for effective therapeutic benefits. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits several complications such as lung damage, blood clot formation, respiratory illness and organ failures in most of the patients. Based on the accumulation of data, sulfated marine polysaccharides have exerted successful inhibition of virus entry, attachment and replication with known or unknown possible mechanisms against deadly animal and human viruses so far. Since the virus entry into the host cells is the key process, the prevention of such entry mechanism makes any antiviral strategy effective. Enveloped viruses are more sensitive to polyanions than non-enveloped viruses. Besides, the viral infection caused by RNA virus types embarks severe oxidative stress in the human body that leads to malfunction of tissues and organs. In this context, polysaccharides play a very significant role in providing shielding effect against the virus due to their polyanionic rich features and a molecular weight that hinders their reactive surface glycoproteins. Significantly the functional groups especially sulfate, sulfate pattern and addition, uronic acids, monosaccharides, glycosidic linkage and high molecular weight have greater influence in the antiviral activity. Moreover, they are very good antioxidants that can reduce the free radical generation and provokes intracellular antioxidant enzymes. Additionally, polysaccharides enable a host-virus immune response, activate phagocytosis and stimulate interferon systems. Therefore, polysaccharides can be used as candidate drugs, adjuvants in vaccines or combination with other antivirals, antioxidants and immune-activating nutritional supplements and antiviral materials in healthcare products to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Objective
To assess mortality rates (MRs), standardized mortality ratios, and causes of death in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a population-based study.
Methods
We analyzed linked administrative health databases of the Veneto Region (Italy, 4,900,000 residents). SLE was defined by any hospital diagnosis or healthcare copayment exemption for SLE. We analyzed mortality from January 1st, 2012, until December 31st, 2021. MRs per 1000 were stratified by year, sex, and age group. Standardized mortality ratios were derived by comparing MRs of the general regional population. Causes of death were coded using the ICD-10 coding system and they were grouped in: SLE, infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cancer, or others.
Results
Among 4283 SLE prevalent cases, 603 deaths occurred, corresponding to an average annual standardized MR of 18.6 per 1000 person/year (95% CI 17.0-20.2). Out of 1092 incident SLE patients, 90 died with a peak in the first year after diagnosis (MR 26.5 per 10,000 person/month). Standardized mortality ratio was 2.65 (95% CI 2.13-3.26) overall, and highest among younger patients (<45 years: 5.59, 95% CI 2.05-12.4). Five- and 8-year survival were 91% and 89%, respectively. About half of the deaths had CVD or cancer as underlying cause, whereas infections were less frequently reported.
Conclusions
Although the medium-term survival since diagnosis is good, SLE mortality is still higher than that of the general population, especially in youngest patients. Nowadays, CVD seems to be the major cause of deaths in SLE, whereas infections account for a low proportion of deaths, at least in Western countries.

AB  - At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic South Africa was praised for decisive political leadership based on scientific advice and the strictness of the measures it imposed to limit domestic spread of the virus. This paper critically examines the South African response through two conceptual frameworks. The first frames an optimal policy response as a solution to an intertemporal welfare-optimisation problem. The need for governments to balance epidemiological considerations and public health measures with the negative consequences of non-pharmaceutical interventions to limit transmission is particularly acute in developing countries. The second considers the use of scientific evidence and expertise through the lens of scientism – undue deference to science. The South African government erred towards drastic action in the face of predictions by some scientific advisors of a catastrophe, but initially without a clear, public long-term plan. Its lockdown has caused serious economic and societal harm across a range of measures. But these costs have not been matched by proportional benefits in health system preparedness or, based on evidence three months into the epidemic, a definitive improvement in expected long-term epidemic outcomes. This failure, and the questionably confident basis for the original lockdown decision, has been obscured by the government’s performative scientism – a public performance of deference to science – even in the absence of transparent decision-making. One consequence was a slower correction of strategy than merited by evidence of limited benefits and high costs of the lockdown. Another was an unwillingness to admit and explain errors after the fact. The latter, combined with the convincingness of the initial performance undermined the behavioural dimension of policy – leading to beliefs among citizens that confounded efforts by the state to adapt its policy stance through reopening schools, reducing the stringency of clinical guidelines and resuming various economic activities while nevertheless observing basic social distancing precautions.

AB  - The focus of attention regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has been on direct health outcomes and the macroeconomic impacts of control measures. Here we review the available evidence about the food security impacts of the pandemic on pastoralists in Eastern and Western Africa. While pastoralism occurs on more than 50% of the world's land area, the landscapes that pastoralists exploit tend to be remote and highly variable arid and semi-arid lands with low population densities. Over time pastoralists have developed sophisticated mechanisms to enhance their self-sufficiency. At the same time, remoteness and sociopolitical marginalization have resulted in higher rates of food insecurity and underdevelopment among pastoralists relative to more sedentary populations. These dynamics tend to be intractable to standardized food security, malnutrition, and economic development interventions. The COVID-19 pandemic is contributing to a worsening of food security trends in pastoralist areas of East and West Africa due to a multiplicity of factors, including the closure of livestock markets, movement restrictions, disruptions of supply chains and livestock production inputs, reduced frequency and quality of human and animal healthcare delivery, and lost income from complementary livelihoods. It opens, however, space for innovations that may contribute to the food-secure future of pastoralism, including adapting a One Health approach that addresses the social, economic, and environmental health determinants of food security among African pastoralists.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic is still a major risk to human civilization. Besides the global immunization policy, more than five lac new cases are documented everyday. Some countries newly implement partial/complete nationwid lockdown to mitigate recurrent community spreading. To avoid the new modified stain of SARS-CoV-2 spreading, some countries imposed any restriction on the movement of the citizens within or outside the country. Effective economical point of care diagnostic and therapeutic strategy is vigorously required to mitigate viral spread. Besides struggling with repurposed medicines, new engineered materials with multiple unique efficacies and specific antiviral potency against SARS-CoV-2 infection may be fruitful to save more lives. Nanotechnology-based engineering strategy sophisticated medicine with specific, effective and nonhazardous delivery mechanism for available repurposed antivirals as well as remedial for associated diseases due to malfeasance in immuno-system e.g. hypercytokinaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome. This review will talk about gloomy but critical areas for nanoscientists to intervene and will showcase about the different laboratory diagnostic, prognostic strategies and their mode of actions. In addition, we speak about SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology, pathogenicity and host specific interation with special emphasis on altered immuno-system and also perceptualized, copious ways to design prophylactic nanomedicines and next-generation vaccines based on recent findings.

AB  - In this paper we draw a parallel between the insights developed within the framework of the current COVID-19 health crisis and the views and insights developed with respect to the long term environmental crisis, the implications for science, technology and innovation (STI) policy, Christopher Freeman analyzed already in the early 90′s. With at the time of writing, the COVID-19 pandemic entering in many countries a third wave with a very differentiated implementation path of vaccination across rich and poor countries, drawing such a parallel remains of course a relatively speculative exercise. Nevertheless, based on the available evidence of the first wave of the pandemic, we feel confident that some lessons from the current health crisis and its parallels with the long-term environmental crisis can be drawn. The COVID-19 pandemic has also been described as a “syndemic”: a term popular in medical anthropology which marries the concept of ‘synergy’ with ‘epidemic’ and provides conceptually an interesting background for these posthumous Freeman reflections on crises. The COVID-19 crisis affects citizens in very different and disproportionate ways. It results not only in rising structural inequalities among social groups and classes, but also among generations. In the paper, we focus on the growing inequality within two particular groups: youngsters and the impact of COVID-19 on learning and the organization of education; and as mirror picture, the elderly many of whom witnessed despite strict confinement in long-term care facilities, high mortality following the COVID-19 outbreak. From a Freeman perspective, these inequality consequences of the current COVID-19 health crisis call for new social STI policies: for a new “corona version” of inclusion versus exclusion.

AB  - Background
Despite high contagiousness and rapid spread, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to heterogeneous outcomes across affected nations. Within Europe (EU), the United Kingdom (UK) is the most severely affected country, with a death toll in excess of 100,000 as of January 2021. We aimed to compare the national impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the risk of death in UK patients with cancer versus those in continental EU.
Methods
We performed a retrospective analysis of the OnCovid study database, a European registry of patients with cancer consecutively diagnosed with COVID-19 in 27 centres from 27th February to 10th September 2020. We analysed case fatality rates and risk of death at 30 days and 6 months stratified by region of origin (UK versus EU). We compared patient characteristics at baseline including oncological and COVID-19–specific therapy across UK and EU cohorts and evaluated the association of these factors with the risk of adverse outcomes in multivariable Cox regression models.
Findings
Compared with EU (n = 924), UK patients (n = 468) were characterised by higher case fatality rates (40.38% versus 26.5%, p < 0.0001) and higher risk of death at 30 days (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.36–1.99]) and 6 months after COVID-19 diagnosis (47.64% versus 33.33%; p < 0.0001; HR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.33–1.88]). UK patients were more often men, were of older age and have more comorbidities than EU counterparts (p < 0.01). Receipt of anticancer therapy was lower in UK than in EU patients (p < 0.001). Despite equal proportions of complicated COVID-19, rates of intensive care admission and use of mechanical ventilation, UK patients with cancer were less likely to receive anti–COVID-19 therapies including corticosteroids, antivirals and interleukin-6 antagonists (p < 0.0001). Multivariable analyses adjusted for imbalanced prognostic factors confirmed the UK cohort to be characterised by worse risk of death at 30 days and 6 months, independent of the patient's age, gender, tumour stage and status; number of comorbidities; COVID-19 severity and receipt of anticancer and anti–COVID-19 therapy. Rates of permanent cessation of anticancer therapy after COVID-19 were similar in the UK and EU cohorts.
Interpretation
UK patients with cancer have been more severely impacted by the unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic despite societal risk mitigation factors and rapid deferral of anticancer therapy. The increased frailty of UK patients with cancer highlights high-risk groups that should be prioritised for anti–SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Continued evaluation of long-term outcomes is warranted.

AB  - Background
The risk factors that emerge with the onset and protraction of humanitarian crises leave populations at a heightened risk of excess morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). There is currently little clarity on which vaccines are being used in crises throughout the world, and whether vaccination decisions correspond to local disease threats. This review aimed to collect and analyse such information.
Methods
We reviewed vaccination services from January 2015 to June 2019 across all 25 humanitarian responses that had an activated coordination mechanism during this period. A range of online sources and informants within the humanitarian sector were consulted to compile data on which vaccines were provided in each crisis, and the modality and timing of vaccine provision. The package of vaccination services since the start of each crisis was then compared with local disease burden (baseline + excess due to crisis-emergent risk factors).
Results
The range of vaccines used in humanitarian crises appears limited. When offered, vaccines were primarily delivered through the pre-existing routine schedule, with few supplementary actions taken in recognition of the need for rapidly enhancing population immunity. Vaccine packages mostly did not address the actual range of VPDs that likely accounted for substantial disease risk.
Conclusions
This review suggests inconsistencies and inequities in vaccine provision to crisis-affected populations. A consistent, standardised and broader approach to vaccine use in crises is needed.

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred an intense global effort to repurpose existing approved drugs for its treatment. In this review, we highlight the development of seven small-molecule drugs that are currently being assessed in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. Three sections are presented for each drug: (1) history, mechanism of action, and status of clinical trials; (2) scalable synthetic routes and final forms; and (3) outlook for supply should clinical trials show treatment efficacy. A brief overview of diagnostic testing and vaccine development is also presented.

AB  - Zoonotic viruses originate from birds or animal sources and responsible for disease transmission from animals to people through zoonotic spill over and presents a significant global health concern due to lack of rapid diagnostics and therapeutics. The Corona viruses (CoV) were known to be transmitted in mammals. Early this year, SARS-CoV-2, a novel strain of corona virus, was identified as the causative pathogen of an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China. The disease later named corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), subsequently spread across the globe rapidly. Nano-particles and viruses are comparable in size, which serves to be a major advantage of using nano-material in clinical strategy to combat viruses. Nanotechnology provides novel solutions against zoonotic viruses by providing cheap and efficient detection methods, novel, and new effective rapid diagnostics and therapeutics. The prospective of nanotechnology in COVID 19 is exceptionally high due to their small size, large surface-to-volume ratio, susceptibility to modification, intrinsic viricidal activity. The nano-based strategies address the COVID 19 by extending their role in i) designing nano-materials for drug/vaccine delivery, ii) developing nano-based diagnostic approaches like nano-sensors iii) novel nano-based personal protection equipment to be used in prevention strategies.This review aims to bring attention to the significant contribution of nanotechnology to mitigate against zoonotic viral pandemics by prevention, faster diagnosis and medication point of view.

AB  - Objective
Previous studies have shown that meteorological factors may increase COVID-19 mortality, likely due to the increased transmission of the virus. However, this could also be related to an increased infection fatality rate (IFR). We investigated the association between meteorological factors (temperature, humidity, solar irradiance, pressure, wind, precipitation, cloud coverage) and IFR across Spanish provinces (n = 52) during the first wave of the pandemic (weeks 10–16 of 2020).
Methods
We estimated IFR as excess deaths (the gap between observed and expected deaths, considering COVID-19-unrelated deaths prevented by lockdown measures) divided by the number of infections (SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals plus excess deaths) and conducted Spearman correlations between meteorological factors and IFR across the provinces.
Results
We estimated 2,418,250 infections and 43,237 deaths. The IFR was 0.03% in < 50-year-old, 0.22% in 50–59-year-old, 0.9% in 60–69-year-old, 3.3% in 70–79-year-old, 12.6% in 80–89-year-old, and 26.5% in ≥ 90-year-old. We did not find statistically significant relationships between meteorological factors and adjusted IFR. However, we found strong relationships between low temperature and unadjusted IFR, likely due to Spain's colder provinces' aging population.
Conclusion
The association between meteorological factors and adjusted COVID-19 IFR is unclear. Neglecting age differences or ignoring COVID-19-unrelated deaths may severely bias COVID-19 epidemiological analyses.

AB  - Summary
We develop a model to retrospectively evaluate age-dependent counterfactual vaccine allocation strategies against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To estimate the effect of allocation on the expected severe-case incidence, we employ a simulation-assisted causal modeling approach that combines a compartmental infection-dynamics simulation, a coarse-grained causal model, and literature estimates for immunity waning. We compare Israel’s strategy, implemented in 2021, with counterfactual strategies such as no prioritization, prioritization of younger age groups, or a strict risk-ranked approach; we find that Israel’s implemented strategy was indeed highly effective. We also study the impact of increasing vaccine uptake for given age groups. Because of its modular structure, our model can easily be adapted to study future pandemics. We demonstrate this by simulating a pandemic with characteristics of the Spanish flu. Our approach helps evaluate vaccination strategies under the complex interplay of core epidemic factors, including age-dependent risk profiles, immunity waning, vaccine availability, and spreading rates.

AB  - The practice of social distancing and wearing masks has been popular worldwide in combating the contraction of COVID-19. Undeniably, although such practices help control the COVID-19 pandemic to a greater extent, the complete control of virus-laden droplet and aerosol transmission by such practices is poorly understood. This review paper intends to outline the literature concerning the transmission of virus-laden droplets and aerosols in different environmental settings and demonstrates the behavior of droplets and aerosols resulted from a cough-jet of an infected person in various confined spaces. The case studies that have come out in different countries have, with prima facie evidence, manifested that the airborne transmission plays a profound role in contracting susceptible hosts. The infection propensities in confined spaces (airplane, passenger car, and healthcare center) by the transmission of droplets and aerosols under varying ventilation conditions were discussed. Interestingly, the nosocomial transmission by airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus-laden aerosols in healthcare facilities may be plausible. Hence, clearly defined, science-based administrative, clinical, and physical measures are of paramount importance to eradicate the COVID-19 pandemic from the world.

AB  - Summary
Group 2B β-coronaviruses (sarbecoviruses) have caused regional and global epidemics in modern history. Here, we evaluate the mechanisms of cross-sarbecovirus protective immunity, currently less clear yet important for pan-sarbecovirus vaccine development, using a panel of alphavirus-vectored vaccines covering bat to human strains. While vaccination does not prevent virus replication, it protects against lethal heterologous disease outcomes in both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and clade 2 bat sarbecovirus challenge models. The spike vaccines tested primarily elicit a highly S1-specific homologous neutralizing antibody response with no detectable cross-virus neutralization. Rather, non-neutralizing antibody functions, mechanistically linked to FcgR4 and spike S2, mediate cross-protection in wild-type mice. Protection is lost in FcR knockout mice, further supporting a model for non-neutralizing, protective antibodies. These data highlight the importance of FcR-mediated cross-protective immune responses in universal pan-sarbecovirus vaccine designs.

AB  - Objectives
The Hungarian vaccination campaign was conducted with five different vaccines during the third wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2021. This observational study (HUN-VE: Hungarian Vaccine Effectiveness) estimated vaccine effectiveness against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19-related mortality in 3.7 million vaccinated individuals.
Methods
Incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related mortality were calculated using data from the National Public Health Centre surveillance database. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was calculated as 1 – incidence rate ratio ≥7 days after the second dose for each available vaccine versus an unvaccinated control group using mixed-effect negative binomial regression controlling for age, sex and calendar day.
Results
Between 22 January 2021 and 10 June 2021, 3 740 066 Hungarian individuals received two doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), HB02 (Sinopharm), Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik-V), AZD1222 (AstraZeneca), or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines. Incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related death were 1.73–9.3/100 000 person-days and 0.04–0.65/100 000 person-days in the fully vaccinated population, respectively. Estimated adjusted effectiveness varied between 68.7% (95% CI 67.2%–70.1%) and 88.7% (95% CI 86.6%–90.4%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and between 87.8% (95% CI 86.1%–89.4%) and 97.5% (95% CI 95.6%–98.6%) against COVID-19-related death, with 100% effectiveness in individuals aged 16–44 years for all vaccines.
Conclusions
Our observational study demonstrated the high or very high effectiveness of five different vaccines in the prevention SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related death.

AB  - In the last two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has undeniably changed everyday life and significantly reshaped the healthcare systems. Besides the direct effect on daily care leading to significant excess mortality, several collateral damages have been observed during the pandemic. The impact of the pandemic led to staff shortages, disrupted education, worse healthcare professional well-being, and a lack of proper clinical training and research. In this review we highlight the results of these important changes and how can the healthcare systems can adapt to prevent unprecedented events in case of future catastrophes.

AB  - The first cases of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were reported in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Four months later around 1.699595 million people globally are infected with the virus causing more than 106,138 deaths.Various countries have taken preventive and control measures to combat this disproportionate impact of COVID-19. It was noted that the pandemic scenario projections work better once scaled down to city level. The QC Disaster Resilience Scorecard (DRS) and Public Health Addendum (PHA) are also the integral part of the methodology considered in operationalizing the DRMF-COVID-19-P. Hence, authors developed and operationalized a local level Disaster Risk Management Framework (DRMF) for COVID-19 Pandemic using 14 guiding principles. Consequently, Quezon City Inclusive Unified Response, Recovery, and Rehabilitation Action Plan 2020–2030 is prepared. It consists of 11 very dynamic Programs, Projects, and Activities (PPAs). Essentially, the accomplishment level of these PPAs and status of reproduction rate of the virus directs the assertion to end the current COVID-19 Lockdown or initiation of incremental ease in lockdown. In fact the timing to commence such initiation is depending upon the accomplishment of pertinent PPAs and scientific findings that recommend Smart Lockdown. It refers to the use of decision-making criteria such as confirmed case/outbreak threshold ratio, probability of outbreak, etc., defined by different authorities for decision-making especially in declaring of community quarantine at Barangay/Municipality/City level.

AB  - Objective
The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the need for understanding pathways to healthcare demand, morbidity, and mortality of pandemic patients. We estimate H1N1 (1) hospitalization rates, (2) severity rates (length of stay, ventilation, pneumonia, and death) of those hospitalized, (3) mortality rates, and (4) time lags between infections and hospitalizations during the pandemic (June 2009 to March 2010) and post-pandemic influenza season (November 2010 to February 2011) in England.
Methods
Estimates of H1N1 infections from a dynamic transmission model are combined with hospitalizations and severity using time series econometric analyses of administrative patient-level hospital data.
Results
Hospitalization rates were 34% higher and severity rates of those hospitalized were 20%–90% higher in the post-pandemic period than the pandemic. Adults (45–64-years-old) had the highest ventilation and pneumonia hospitalization rates. Hospitalizations did not lag infection during the pandemic for the young (<24-years-old) but lagged by one or more weeks for all ages in the post-pandemic period.
Discussion
The post-pandemic flu season exhibited heightened H1N1 severity, long after the pandemic was declared over. Policymakers should remain vigilant even after pandemics seem to have subsided. Analysis of administrative hospital data and epidemiological modelling estimates can provide valuable insights to inform responses to COVID-19 and future influenza and other disease pandemics.

KW  - Prevalence
AB  - Background
The emergence and rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents a major challenge to health services, and has disrupted social and economic activities worldwide. In Spain, the first pandemic wave started in mid-March 2020 and lasted for 3 months, requiring home confinement and strict lockdown. Following relaxation of the measures during the summer, a second wave commenced in mid-September 2020 and extended until Christmas 2020.
Methods
The two pandemic waves were compared using information collected from rapid diagnostic tests and polymerase chain reaction assays at one university clinic in Madrid, the epicentre of the pandemic in Spain.
Results
In total, 1569 individuals (968 during the first wave and 601 during the second wave) were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using fingerprick capillary blood. In addition, during the second wave, 346 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antigen using either oral swabs or saliva. The overall seroprevalence of first-time-tested individuals was 12.6% during the first wave and 7.7% during the second wave (P < 0.01). Seroconversions and seroreversions within 6 months occurred at low rates, both below 5%. During the second wave, 3.5% of tested individuals were SARS-CoV-2 antigen positive, with two cases considered as re-infections. Severe clinical symptoms occurred in a greater proportion of cases during the first wave compared with the second wave (27.8% vs 10.6%, respectively; P = 0.03).
Conclusion
The cumulative seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Madrid at the end of 2020 was approximately 20%. Seroreversions within 6 months occurred in 4% of cases. Seroconversions and re-infections were clinically less severe during the second wave than during the first wave. Hypothetically, a lower viral inoculum as a result of social distancing, increased use of face masks, promotion of outdoor activities and restrictions on gatherings may have contributed to this lower pathogenicity.

KW  - broader value of vaccination
KW  - health system capacity value
KW  - health system pressure
AB  - Objectives
In situations of excess demand for healthcare, treating one patient means losing the opportunity to treat another. Therefore, each decision bears an opportunity cost. Nevertheless, when assessing the value of health technologies, these opportunity costs are not always fully considered. We present a pragmatic approach for conceptualizing vaccines’ health system capacity value when considering opportunity costs.
Methods
Our approach proxies opportunity costs through the net monetary benefit forgone as scarce healthcare resources are used to treat a vaccine-preventable disease instead of a patient from the waiting list. We apply this approach to cost the resource “hospital beds” for 3 different scenarios of excess demand. Empirically, we estimate the opportunity costs saved for 4 selected vaccination programs from the national schedule in England during a hypothetical scenario of long-lasting excess demand induced by the pandemic.
Results
The opportunity cost avoided through vaccination rises with excess demand for treatment. When treating an acute vaccine-preventable outcome is a suboptimal choice compared with treating elective patients, preventing a vaccine-preventable disease from blocking a hospital bed generates opportunity cost savings of approximately twice the direct costs saved by avoiding vaccine-preventable hospitalizations.
Conclusions
Policy makers should be aware that, in addition to preventing the outcome of interest, vaccines and other preventative health technologies deliver value in maintaining regular healthcare services and clearing the pent-up demand from the pandemic. Therefore, health system capacity value should be a key-value element in health technology assessment. Existing and potential future vaccination programs deliver more value than hitherto quantified.

AB  - Objective
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disproportionately impacted nursing homes (NHs) with large shares of Black residents. We examined the associations between the proportion of Black residents in NHs and COVID-19 infections and deaths, accounting for structural bias (operationalized as county-level factors) and stratifying by urbanicity/rurality.
Design
This was a cross-sectional observational cohort study using publicly available data from the LTCfocus, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Long-Term Care Facility COVID-19 Module, and the NYTimes county-level COVID-19 database. Four multivariable linear regression models omitting and including facility characteristics, COVID-19 burden, and county-level fixed effects were estimated.
Setting and Participants
In total, 11,587 US NHs that reported data on COVID-19 to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and had data in LTCfocus and NYTimes from January 20, 2020 through July 19, 2020.
Measures
Proportion of Black residents in NHs (exposure); COVID-19 infections and deaths (main outcomes).
Results
The proportion of Black residents in NHs were as follows: none= 3639 (31.4%), <20% = 1020 (8.8%), 20%-49.9% = 1586 (13.7%), ≥50% = 681 (5.9%), not reported = 4661 (40.2%). NHs with any Black residents showed significantly more COVID-19 infections and deaths than NHs with no Black residents. There were 13.6 percentage points more infections and 3.5 percentage points more deaths in NHs with ≥50% Black residents than in NHs with no Black residents (P < .001). Although facility characteristics explained some of the differences found in multivariable analyses, county-level factors and rurality explained more of the differences.
Conclusions and Implications
It is likely that attributes of place, such as resources, services, and providers, important to equitable care and health outcomes are not readily available to counties where NHs have greater proportions of Black residents. Structural bias may underlie these inequities. It is imperative that support be provided to NHs that serve greater proportions of Black residents while considering the rurality of the NH setting.

The objective of this research is to model the economic consequences of the epidemic and also to highlight the importance of the containment policy in facilitating economic recovery in Morocco. The results obtained using a combination of Ramsey's model and the epidemiological propagation model affirm that the choice of the containment policy made it possible to reduce the negative repercussions of the pandemic on Morocco, despite the economic consequences of the latter. The comparisons made between the two situations confirm that the economic repercussions remain moderate and Morocco will be able to face this disaster with even stricter or even more intelligent containment.

The increased prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk factors in people hospitalized with severe COVID-19 illness has engendered considerable interest in the metabolic aspects of SARS-CoV-2-induced pathophysiology. Here, I update concepts informing how metabolic disorders and their co-morbidities modify the susceptibility to, natural history, and potential treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a focus on human biology. New data informing genetic predisposition, epidemiology, immune responses, disease severity, and therapy of COVID-19 in people with obesity and diabetes are highlighted. The emerging relationships of metabolic disorders to viral-induced immune responses and viral persistence, and the putative importance of adipose and islet ACE2 expression, glycemic control, cholesterol metabolism, and glucose- and lipid-lowering drugs is reviewed, with attention to controversies and unresolved questions. Rapid progress in these areas informs our growing understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with diabetes and obesity, while refining the therapeutic strategies and research priorities in this vulnerable population.

AB  - To slow the COVID-19 virus, many countries shut down parts of the economy. Older individuals have the most to gain from slowing virus diffusion. Younger workers in shuttered sectors have most to lose. We build a model in which economic activity and disease progression are jointly determined. Individuals differ by age, sector and health status. Disease transmission occurs at work, at home, through consumption, and in hospitals. Optimal economic shutdowns in 2020 are milder when taxes are distortionary, and when the government does not have access to debt. A harder, shorter shutdown is preferred when vaccines become available in early 2021.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant was first detected in France mid-November 2021 in wastewater treatment plants while cases started to increase at the beginning of December. The maximum incidence occurred in mid-January 2022. The Omicron wave spread rapidly throughout France in general population with lower case-fatality rate compared with previous waves. Little is known about infection with Omicron variant in heart transplant (HT) recipients. In this study, we examined incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in the general population and among 1,263 HT recipients during the period from June, 2021 to February, 2022, described characteristics of HT recipients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during Omicron (December 1st, 2021-February 7, 2022) and Delta (June 1st- November 30, 2021) periods, and compared hospital course of HT recipients with Omicron and Delta variant infection. Our findings contrast with the reported lower severity for Omicron variant infection compared with Delta variant infection in immunocompetent individuals.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation and containment strategies implemented by each country can influence the prevalence of asthma and its fatality.
Objective
To analyze the trend of asthma prevalence and COVID-19 fatality in children and adults with asthma.
Methods
The prevalence of asthma and fatalities were compared among the peaks of 5 pandemic waves in Mexico.
Results
Among patients with COVID-19, the prevalence rates of asthma among children were as follows: wave I, 3.5%; wave II, 2.6%; wave III, 2.2%; wave IV, 2.4%; and wave V, 1.9% (P for trend < .001); the prevalence rates of asthma among adults were as follows: wave I, 2.5%; wave II, 1.8%; wave III, 1.5%; wave IV, 1.7%; and wave V, 1.6% (P for trend < .001). The rates of fatality because of COVID-19 among individuals with asthma were as follows: wave I, 8.9%; wave II, 7.7%; wave III, 5.0%; wave IV, 0.9%; and wave V, 0.2% (P for trend < .001).
Conclusion
The prevalence rates of asthma and fatalities from COVID-19 suggest a gradual reduction throughout the pandemic in Mexico.

AB  - Nursing home residents are highly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and complications. We used a generalized linear mixed Poisson model and spatial statistics to examine the determinants of COVID-19 deaths in 13,350 nursing homes in the first 2-year pandemic period using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and county-level related data. The average prevalence of COVID-19 mortality among residents was 9.02 (Interquartile range = 10.18) per 100 nursing home beds in the first 2-year of the pandemic. Fully-adjusted mixed model shows that nursing homes COVID-19 deaths reduced by 5% (Q2 versus Q1: IRR = 0.949, 95% CI 0.901– 0.999), 14.4% (Q3 versus Q1: IRR = 0.815, 95% CI 0.718 – 0.926), and 25% (Q2 versus Q1: IRR = 0.751, 95% CI 0.701– 0.805) of facility ratings. Spatial analysis showed a significant hotspot of nursing home COVID-19 deaths in the Northeast US. This study contributes to nursing home quality assessment for improving residents' health.

AB  - BACKGROUND
COVID-19 during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes for both the mother and fetus. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has significantly reduced the risk for symptomatic disease. Several studies have reported on the safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy, with no adverse effects on the obstetrical outcomes. However, data regarding the obstetrical outcomes following a booster dose of the SARS CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy have not yet to be published.
OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to examine the association between the booster dose of the SARS CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy and obstetrical outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN
This was a retrospective cohort study of women who delivered between July and October 2021 at a large tertiary medical center. We compared women who received the booster vaccination dose during pregnancy with women who were not vaccinated and with those who only received 2 vaccination doses. Primary outcomes were the incidence of preterm labor and of small for gestational age neonates. Secondary outcomes were other maternal and neonatal complications. A secondary analysis investigating the association between the time from vaccination to delivery and the outcomes was also performed. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to adjust for potential confounders.
RESULTS
There were 6507 women who met the inclusion criteria: 294 women received 3 doses of the vaccination, 2845 women received only 2 doses, and 3368 were unvaccinated. Patients receiving 3 doses of the vaccine were older and more likely to smoke than unvaccinated patients. No differences were noted among the triple-vaccinated, twice-vaccinated, and unvaccinated groups with regards to preterm birth and the incidence of small for gestational age neonates. Regarding the secondary outcomes, women in the triple-vaccinated group had higher rates of postpartum hemorrhage (9.5% vs 3.21%; P<.001) and gestational diabetes mellitus (12.2% vs 8.3%; P=.02) and were less likely to have hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (0% vs 1.4%; P=.041) than the unvaccinated group. Compared with the twice-vaccinated patients, patients with 3 doses of the vaccine were more likely to experience postpartum hemorrhage (9.5% vs 3.5%; P<.001) and were less likely to have a low umbilical artery pH (0.7% vs 6.1%; P<.001). In the sensitivity analysis comparing patients who delivered within 2 weeks of the third vaccination dose (n=53) with those who delivered at least 6 weeks after vaccination (n=96), there were no differences in the rates of small for gestational age neonates, preterm birth, postpartum hemorrhage, or cesarean delivery.
CONCLUSION
Receiving the booster dose of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with adverse obstetrical outcomes when compared with unvaccinated or twice-vaccinated women. However, higher rates of postpartum hemorrhage were observed. Further studies on a larger scale are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - The recent coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has caused unprecedented turmoil and spurred fears that have profoundly changed the public's social and health behaviours, including the perception of food safety risks. One year after the pandemic and the global vaccination campaign, the public perception of food safety and the changes in their hygiene behaviour, health risks concerns, and trust were studied in Jordan, Lebanon, and Tunisia using a cross-sectional online survey. The results of 538 subjects showed a rise in the frequency of hygiene practices, notably in handwashing. Sixty-four percent of the participants were vaccinated, a proportion made up mainly of the Jordanians and Lebanese. For 66% and 64% of the two population groups, respectively, there were no longer trust concerns about COVID-19 health risks following vaccination, whereas the worries about getting COVID-19 persisted for others. Only 47% of participants trusted eating food prepared by vaccinated food handlers. A great majority of the Tunisians (81%) showed varying degrees of concern about COVID-19 transmission from food and the lowest vaccination rate (33%). The current study demonstrated that the impact of vaccination policy positively affects public perception of food-related risks during the pandemic. On the other hand, 33% of the surveyed Jordanians and Tunisians lost trust in the health authorities' management of the pandemic, and 45% of the Lebanese still don't trust them. Communication strategies on health and food safety with the public still represent a challenge for these and probably other countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Strategies for building and maintaining public trust are crucial to curb persistent fear of food, hence, avoiding potential stigmatization affecting the food economy by promoting health awareness and positive changes in food safety perceptions for safer practices.

AB  - In this paper, we estimate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the banking system and the real economy and simulate potential policy responses. We combine machine learning algorithms, namely a Random Regression Forest and a Long Short Term Memory neural network, with an agent-based framework to calculate the expected results of the pandemic, according to different scenarios regarding financial stability. We then simulate government responses to this crisis and find that traditional demand and supply stimuli are outperformed by our suggestion of relaxing bank regulation. We examine two alternatives of our suggested policy and find that they result in optimised outcomes for most variables examined. Our findings have important policy implications as authorities are formulating post-crisis recovery plans amidst budgetary constraints.

AB  - Summary
Background
Mucosal antibodies play a key role in the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper respiratory tract, and potentially in limiting virus replication and therefore onward transmission. While systemic immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is well understood, we have a limited understanding about the antibodies present on the nasal mucosal surfaces.
Methods
In this study, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 mucosal antibodies following previous infection, vaccination, or a combination of both. Paired nasal fluid and serum samples were collected from 143 individuals, which include convalescent, vaccinated, or breakthrough infections.
Findings
We detected a high correlation between IgG responses in serum and nasal fluids, which were higher in both compartments in vaccinated compared to convalescent participants. Contrary, nasal and systemic SARS-CoV-2 IgA responses were weakly correlated, indicating a compartmentalization between the local and systemic IgA responses. SARS-CoV-2 secretory component IgA (s-IgA) antibodies, present exclusively on mucosal surfaces, were detected in the nasal fluid only in a minority of vaccinated subjects and were significantly higher in previously infected individuals. Depletion of IgA antibodies in nasal fluids resulted in a tremendous reduction of neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2, indicating that IgA is the crucial contributor to neutralization in the nasal mucosa. Neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 was higher in the mucosa of subjects with previous SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to vaccinated participants.
Interpretation
In summary, we demonstrate that currently available vaccines elicit strong systemic antibody responses, but SARS-CoV-2 infection generates higher titers of binding and neutralizing mucosal antibodies. Our results support the importance to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that elicit mucosal antibodies.
Funding
The work was funded by the COVID-19 National Research Program 78 (grant number 198412) of the Swiss National Science Foundation.

AB  - The traditional health economic analysis is limited to estimating the impact on the treated patient. As vaccines are usually aimed at preventing infectious diseases, they may be associated with additional values for the non-treated wider population. Although there are valid reasons for treating vaccines differently, and a wide support for a broader perspective in the literature (i.e., beyond the net costs and health gain related to the outcome for the vaccinated individual), it remains unclear to what extent the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) agencies accept and apply a broader perspective. The purpose of this study is to examine and discuss what type of consequences are relevant for a health economic analysis of vaccines and which consequences are considered by HTA agencies. The study includes a strategic review of literature and HTA decisions in Sweden and other countries, online round-table discussions with stakeholders in Sweden, and a basic estimation of the value of a COVID-19 vaccination in Sweden. The study shows that, other than herd effect, broader economic consequences for the population are generally not included in the economic evaluation of vaccines. Also, all economic consequences for the treated patient (production loss) and caregiver (health loss) are not always considered. The perspective chosen can have a major impact on the outcome of the analysis. A vaccine for COVID-19 is estimated to provide a value of €744–€956 per dose when using a societal perspective including broader consequences for the population. Providing a complete and appropriate picture of the value of vaccination is of importance to allocate resources efficiently, to provide incentives for vaccine development, and to show the cost of delaying decisions to implement a new vaccine.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 led to pandemic spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), manifesting with respiratory symptoms and multi-organ dysfunction. Detailed characterization of virus-neutralizing antibodies and target epitopes is needed to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology and guide immunization strategies. Among 598 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 10 COVID-19 patients, we identified 40 strongly neutralizing mAbs. The most potent mAb, CV07-209, neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 value of 3.1 ng/mL. Crystal structures of two mAbs in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain at 2.55 and 2.70 Å revealed a direct block of ACE2 attachment. Interestingly, some of the near-germline SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAbs reacted with mammalian self-antigens. Prophylactic and therapeutic application of CV07-209 protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection, weight loss, and lung pathology. Our results show that non-self-reactive virus-neutralizing mAbs elicited during SARS-CoV-2 infection are a promising therapeutic strategy.

AB  - In the large literature on the spatial-level correlates of COVID-19, the association between quality of hospital care and outcomes has received little attention to date. To examine whether county-level mortality is correlated with measures of hospital performance, we assess daily cumulative deaths and pre-crisis measures of hospital quality, accounting for state fixed-effects and potential confounders. As a measure of quality, we use the pre-pandemic adjusted five-year penalty rates for excess 30-day readmissions following pneumonia admissions for the hospitals accessible to county residents based on ambulance travel patterns. Our adjustment corrects for socio-economic status and down-weighs observations based on small samples. We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the quality of local hospitals is associated with a 2% lower death rate (relative to the mean of 20 deaths per 10,000 people) one and a half years after the first recorded death.

Introduction
Two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, tozinameran/BNT162b2 (Comirnaty®, Pfizer-BioNTech) and elasomeran/mRNA-1273 (Spikevax®, Moderna), were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) at the end of 2020, less than a year after the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In France, the health authorities have requested an intensive vaccination campaign, accompanied by a reinforced and active pharmacovigilance surveillance. This surveillance and analysis of real-life data, based on spontaneous reports received by the French Network of Regional PharmacoVigilance Centers (RFCRPV), has enabled to identify numerous pharmacovigilance signals. Some of them, such as myocarditis and heavy menstrual bleeding, have been confirmed as adverse effects of these vaccines.
Method
We propose a descriptive review of the main pharmacovigilance signals identified by the RFCRPV concerning vaccines from the mRNA platform.
Results
Most pharmacovigilance signals were common to both mRNA vaccines: myocarditis, menstrual disorders, acquired haemophilia, Parsonage-Turner syndrome, rhizomelic pseudo-polyarthritis and hearing disorders. Other signals were more specific, such as arterial hypertension with tozinameran or delayed reaction site injection with elasomeran.
Conclusion
This non-exhaustive review illustrates the experience of RFCRPV in identifying and monitoring pharmacovigilance signals related to mRNA vaccines in France during the COVID-19 pandemics, and the crucial role of pharmacological and clinical expertise in this area. It also highlights the predominant contribution of spontaneous reporting in the generation of pharmacovigilance signals, particularly for serious and rare adverse events not detected before marketing.

AB  - Background
COVID-19 transmission and disease dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa are not well understood. Our study aims to provide insight into COVID-19 epidemiology in Malawi by estimating SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a hospital-based setting.
Methods
We conducted a hospital-based, convenience sampling, cross-sectional survey for SARS-CoV-2 in Lilongwe, Malawi. Participants answered a questionnaire and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) was performed in seropositive samples to estimate immunity. Poisson regression was used to assess SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence association with demographic and behavioral variables.
Findings
The study included 930 participants. We found a combined point prevalence of 10.1%. Separately analyzed, RT-PCR positivity was 2.0%, and seropositivity was 9.3%. Of tested seropositive samples, 90.1% were sVNT positive. We found a high rate (45.7%) of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence was significantly associated with being a healthcare worker.
Interpretation
Our study suggests that official data underestimate COVID-19 transmission. Using sVNTs to estimate immunity in Malawi is feasible and revealed considerable post-infection immunity in our cohort. Subclinical infection and transmission are probably a game-changer in surveillance, mitigation and vaccination strategies.

AB  - The article describes and reflects upon how multi-level governance and planning in Sweden have been affected by and reacted upon three pending major challenges confronting humanity, namely climate change, migration and the Covid-19 pandemic. These ‘crises’ are broadly considered ‘existential threats’ in need of ‘securitisation’. Causes and adequate reactions are contested, and there are no given solutions how to securitise the perceived threats, neither one by one, no less together. Government securitisation strategies are challenged by counter-securitisation demands, and plaguing vulnerable groups in society by in-securitising predicaments. Taking Sweden as an example the article applies an analytical approach drawing upon strands of securitisation, governance and planning theory. Targeting policy responses to the three perceived crises the intricate relations between government levels, responsibilities, capacities, and actions are scrutinized, including a focus upon the role of planning. Overriding research questions are: How has the governance and planning system – central, regional and local governments - in Sweden responded to the challenges of climate change, migration and Covid-19? What threats were identified? What solutions were proposed? What consequences could be traced? What prospects wait around the corner? Comparing crucial aspects of the crises’ anatomies the article adds to the understanding of the way multilevel, cross-sectional, hybrid governance and planning respond to concurrent crises, thereby also offering clues for action in other geopolitical contexts. The article mainly draws upon recent and ongoing research on manifestations of three cases in the Swedish context. Applying a pragmatic, methodological approach combining elements of securitisation, governance and planning theories with Carol Lee Bacchi’s ‘What is the problem represented to be’ and a touch of interpretive/narrative theory, the study reveals distinct differences between the anatomies of the three crises and their handling. Urgency, extension, state of knowledge/epistemology, governance and planning make different imprints on crises management. Sweden’s long-term climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies imply slow, micro-steps forward based on a combination of social-liberal, ‘circular’ and a touch of ‘green growth’ economies. Migration policy displays a Janus face, on the one hand largely respecting the UN refugee quota system on the other hand applying a detailed regulatory framework causing severe insecurity especially for minor refugees wanting to stay and make their living in Sweden. The Covid-19 outbreak revealed a lack of foresight and eroded/fragmented responsibility causing huge stress upon personnel in elderly and health care and appalling death rates among elderly patients, although governance and planning slowly adapted through securitising policies, leading to potential de-securitisation of the issue. The three crises have caused a security wake-up among governments at all levels and the public in general, and the article concludes by discussing whether this ‘perfect storm’ of crises will result in a farewell to neoliberalism – towards a neo-regulatory state facing further challenges and crises for governance, planning and the role of planners. The tentative prospect rather indicates a mixture of context-dependent ‘hybrid governance’, thus also underlining the crucial role of planners’ role as ‘chameleons’ in complicated governance processes of politics, policy and planning.

AB  - Background
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the putative cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a serious disease that has severely impacted the world. Although vaccines have been developed, it will take time to inoculate the global population. Current guidelines have focused on the treatment of severe cases in hospital settings; however, a void has been created regarding appropriate measures for those in the initial stage of COVID-19 and those experiencing moderate disease severity progressing to desaturation. We assessed clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 with pneumonia at initial presentation treated with corticosteroids.
Methods
Data of 177 consecutive high-risk patients with COVID-19, monitored by telemedicine, were collected and analyzed. Of those, 68 patients were in the initial inflammatory phase of the disease without desaturation and received corticosteroids. The outcomes were evaluated after a follow up of 14 days. Four patients were immediately referred to the hospital because they had explicit desaturation at presentation.
Results
After 14 days, all patients in the inflammatory phase at presentation who were treated with corticosteroids before desaturation were alive and without complications. However, of the four patients with desaturation, one died at the hospital.
Conclusion
In this study, the use of corticosteroids during the initial pulmonary phase of COVID-19 before desaturation, in addition to daily monitoring of patients, prevented disease progression, decreased the risk of complications and incidence of hospitalization and death. However, additional studies with larger number of patients are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - Background
Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) is a very rare disorder described after vaccination with adenoviral vector-based COVID-19 vaccines. Co-occurring thrombosis with thrombocytopenia reported after vaccination can be a proxy for identification of TTS.
Methods
Descriptive database review of all cases of co-occurring (within 42 days) thrombosis with thrombocytopenia in participants in Ad26.COV2.S clinical trials or recipients of Ad26.COV2.S in real-world clinical practice. Cases were retrieved from Janssens’ clinical trial and Global Medical Safety databases.
Results
There were 34 cases of co-occurring thrombosis with thrombocytopenia in Ad26.COV2.S recipients (46 per 100,000 person-years) and 15 after placebo (75 per 100,000 person-years) in clinical trials. Among Ad26.COV2.S recipients, mean age at the time of the event was 63 years (range 25–85), 82 % were male, mean time-to-onset 112 days (range 8–339) post-last Ad26.COV2.S dose, 26 events occurred post-dose-1, and 7 within a 28-day risk window post-vaccination. Diagnostic certainty was evaluated using Brighton Collaboration, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and European Medicines Agency Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee case definitions. One case met the highest level of diagnostic certainty for all 3 definitions. There were 355 spontaneous reports of co-occurring thrombosis with thrombocytopenia in the Global Medical Safety database, 47 % males, 85 % within 28-days after vaccination. Twenty-seven cases met the highest level of diagnostic certainty for all definitions, 21 female, 19 with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, age-range 18–68 years. Time-to-onset was 7–14 days post-vaccination in 20 cases. There were 8 fatalities.
Conclusion
TTS induced by Ad26.COV2.S is very rare. Most co-occurring thrombosis with thrombocytopenia does not constitute TTS.

AB  - In viral pandemics, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19), the impact of real-life exposures to multiple toxic stressors that increase immune system dysfunction is followed by the main pandemic-associated virus (SARS–CoV–2, for COVID–19) exploiting the dysfunctional immune system to trigger a chain of events ultimately leading to the pandemic (COVID–19). Thus pandemics have two main components: virology (focused on the virus) and toxicology (focused on the toxic stressors). The present chapter will focus mainly on the immune system toxicology component. It identifies the factors shown most frequently to increase immune system dysfunction, and then addresses vaccine toxicology in detail. The chapter concludes by reviewing two types of treatments: immune-augmenting and immune-strengthening. The immune-augmenting approaches are virology-centric (e.g., quarantine, face masks, repurposed antiviral treatments, vaccines, etc.), and the immune-strengthening approaches are toxicology-centric (e.g., eliminating the factors that contribute to immune system dysfunction, and adding factors that increase immune system health).

AB  - UNICEF has declared Yemen as one of the largest humanitarian crises in the world. With the ongoing war, famine, and COVID-19 pandemic converging to create Yemen's current detrimental situation. This further exacerbated Yemen's dwindling resources, contributing to the lack of basic necessities, a poor healthcare system, poverty, food insecurity, illiteracy, pollution, and skyrocketing outbreaks of infectious diseases. Leading to alarming number of maternal mortality and child malnutrition cases. The socioeconomic disparities and financial constraints are making it nearly impossible for Yemen to recover. In the wake of current events, Yemen requires immediate assistance to prevent further crises complications and mortalities.

AB  - Since the very beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in early 2020, it was evident that patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) were at an increased risk of developing severe illness, and complications spanning cerebrovascular disorders, dysrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease, pericarditis, myocarditis, heart failure, thromboembolic disease, stroke, and death. Underlying these was excessive systemic inflammation and coagulopathy due to SARS-COV-2 infection, the effects of which also continued long-term as evidenced by post-COVID-19 cardiovascular complications. The acute and chronic cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 occurred even among those who were not hospitalized and had no previous CVD or those with mild symptoms. This comprehensive review summarizes the current understanding of molecular mechanisms triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus on various cells that express the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, leading to endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, myocarditis, impaired coagulation, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia and a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or Kawasaki-like disease.

AB  - The involvement of viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in autoimmune diseases is well known. The recent demonstration that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Covid-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccine (ChA) favors the production of anti-platelet factor 4 (anti-PF4) antibodies, blood clots, and thrombocytopenia raises the question of whether other anti-CoViD-19 vaccines favor the same patterns of events. We assessed the frequency of severe adverse events (SAEs) documented in the EudraVigilance European database up to April 16, 2021 related to thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and blood clots in recipients of ChA compared to that of recipients of the BNT162b2 Covid-19 (Pfizer/BioNTech) vaccine (BNT). ChA administration was associated with a much higher frequency of SAEs in each AE Reaction Group as compared with that elicited by BNT. When considering AEs caused by thrombocytopenia, bleeding and blood clots, we observed 33 and 151 SAEs/1 million doses in BNT and ChA recipients, respectively. When considering patients with AEs related to cerebral/splanchnic venous thrombosis, and/or thrombocytopenia, we documented 4 and 30 SAEs and 0.4 and 4.8 deaths/1 million doses for BNT and ChA recipients, respectively. The highest risk following ChA vaccination is in young people and, likely, women of reproductive age, as suggested by hypothesized scenarios. In conclusion, the immune reaction promoted by ChA vaccine may lead to not only thrombocytopenia and cerebral/splanchnic venous thrombosis but also other thrombotic and thromboembolic SAEs. These events are not favored by BNT vaccine. Our study may help in the evaluation of the benefit/risk profile of the ChA vaccine considering the epidemic curve present in a country.

AB  - Although social isolation has been associated with higher mortality risk, the associations of persistence of social isolation with mortality are unclear. We investigated the prospective associations of intermittent and persistent social isolation with all-cause and cause-specific mortality, considering the social contact types (face-to-face and non-face-to-face). 30,518 participants were recruited in 2003–2008 initially and 18,104 participants with re-assessed social isolation information in 2008–2012 were followed up to Dec 2019 in Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS). During an average of 9.7 years of follow-up, 2,119 deaths occurred. The isolation at baseline survey, isolation at second survey and persistent isolation were positively associated with all-cause mortality in the minimal adjusted model (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) =1.24, 95% CI 1.12–1.38, 1.11, 1.00–1.23 and 1.23, 1.05–1.43, respectively). Totally 47.2% of the risk was explained by health status, SEP, and biological, behavioural and psychological factors. Persistent isolation from face-to-face with co-inhabitants, versus no isolation, was associated with higher risks of all-cause (HR=1.40, 1.09–1.81) and CVD (subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR)=1.92, 1.31–2.81) mortality in fully adjusted model. Our study showed that intermittent and persistent isolation were generally associated with higher risks of mortality, and the risks were even higher in those with persistent face-to-face isolation with co-inhabitants.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for acute respiratory disease affected other organs leading to co-existence symptoms or complications. Thyroid gland was one of them due to expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the protein facilitating viral binding to the host cells. Moreover, thyroid gland, important for regulation of hormonal network, is extremely sensitive to any changes in homeostasis and metabolism. It was shown, that COVID-19 was associated with induction of thyroid disease or increasing existing functional disturbances or autoimmune process. Thyroid diseases are mainly based on immunological pathomechanism although the relation between immune system and thyroid function is bidirectional e.g. thyroid hormones modulate specific immune responses, including cell-mediated immunity, NK cell activity, the production of antiviral interferon (IFN) and proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes. The effects of COVID-19 and mRNA vaccine on thyroid function and diseases are discussed.

AB  - Purpose
This review aimed to summarise evidence about the impact of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on survival in COPD patients.
Methods
We performed a narrative literature review on the effect of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on survival in COPD patients.
Results
Inhaled therapies are central to reduce symptoms in COPD. In particular, inhaled steroids seem to have the greatest effect on mortality. Despite the anti-inflammatory effects attributed to statins, their benefit in COPD has been shown only in cases of combined cardiovascular diseases. The use of beta-blockers in COPD has not been associated with increased COPD-related mortality and a beneficial effect on all-cause mortality has even been shown in COPD patients with cardiovascular diseases. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination reduced the occurrence of exacerbations and mortality due to COPD. In addition, long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) (≥15h/day) in COPD patients with severe hypoxemia had a positive effect on survival. Regarding non-pharmacological interventions, it has been demonstrated that smoking cessation, treatment compliance and nutritional supplementation for underweight patients also have a positive effect on survival. Non-invasive ventilation results were dependent on patient PaCO2 levels. In patients with advanced COPD, further prospective studies are needed to know the effect of bronchoscopic lung volume reduction and lung transplant on COPD survival. Regarding lung transplant, a survival benefit in patients with a pre-transplant BODE score of ≥7 has been shown in retrospective studies.
Conclusion
Most of the studies did not evaluate survival as the main criteria and further long-term studies on the global management of COPD are required.

AB  - The incidence and severity of COVID-19 infections have been disproportionately high in Native American populations. Native Americans are a high-risk group for COVID-19 because of a variety of healthcare disparities. Historically, these populations suffered excessively during previous epidemics in the United States (US). Several epidemics occurred when disease-naïve indigenous peoples were exposed to European settlers with herd immunity. Native American populations had four times higher mortality in the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic. Deaths from H1N1 infections were higher in Native Americans and most cases and deaths from the Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) occurred in Native Americans. Other infectious diseases, including HIV, hepatitis A and hepatitis C are more also common. Diabetes, alcoholism and cardiovascular diseases, all risk factors for severity and mortality in COVID-19 infection, are also more common in this group. Addressing the root causes of enhanced risk in Native American populations will improve outcomes from COVID-19 and future pandemics.

AB  - Rationale & Objective
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness and immunogenicity threshold associated with protection against COVID-19–related hospitalization or death in the dialysis population are unknown.
Study Design
Retrospective, observational study.
Setting & Participants
Adult patients without COVID-19 history receiving maintenance dialysis through a national dialysis provider and treated between February 1 and December 18, 2021, with follow-up through January 17, 2022.
Predictor
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status.
Outcomes
All SARS-CoV-2 infections, composite of hospitalization or death following COVID-19.
Analytical Approach
Logistic regression was used to determine COVID-19 case rates and vaccine effectiveness.
Results
Of 16,213 patients receiving dialysis during the study period, 12,278 (76%) were fully vaccinated, 589 (4%) were partially vaccinated, and 3,346 (21%) were unvaccinated by the end of follow-up. Of 1,225 COVID-19 cases identified, 550 (45%) occurred in unvaccinated patients, and 891 (73%) occurred during the Delta variant–dominant period. Between the pre-Delta period and the Delta-dominant period, vaccine effectiveness rates against a severe COVID-19–related event (hospitalization or death) were 84% and 70%, respectively. In the subset of 3,202 vaccinated patients with at least one anti-spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) assessment, lower anti-spike IgG levels were associated with higher case rates per 10,000 days and higher adjusted hazard ratios for infection and COVID-19–related hospitalization or death.
Limitations
Observational design, residual biases, and confounding may exist.
Conclusions
Among maintenance dialysis patients, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 diagnosis and associated hospitalization or death. Among vaccinated patients, a low anti-spike IgG level is associated with worse COVID-19–related outcomes.

AB  - Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a viral respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), may predispose patients to thrombotic disease, both in the venous and arterial circulations, because of excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis. In addition, many patients receiving antithrombotic therapy for thrombotic disease may develop COVID-19, which can have implications for choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of antithrombotic therapy. Moreover, during a time with much focus on COVID-19, it is critical to consider how to optimize the available technology to care for patients without COVID-19 who have thrombotic disease. Herein, the authors review the current understanding of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, management, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who develop venous or arterial thrombosis, of those with pre-existing thrombotic disease who develop COVID-19, or those who need prevention or care for their thrombotic disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19, and the national-level lockdown to contain it, were expected to disrupt supply chains, lead to livelihood loss, and reduce household income. Studies anticipated a decline in food security in India, leading to a near famine-like situation. In this study, we examine the change in Dietary Score (number of food groups consumed out of a possible eight) and proportion of respondents complying with Minimum Dietary Diversity norms (consuming at least four food groups) among women aged 15–49 years and their youngest child (aged between 7 and 36 months) during the lockdown. The present study also analyses whether ownership of ration cards and contacts with the party in power locally helped the household to tide over the crisis. The data was collected through a two-phase primary survey undertaken in January-March 2020 (pre-lockdown period) and October-November 2020 (post-lockdown period). It was undertaken in six districts of Bihar, a state with a history of poor maternal and child health outcomes and dysfunctional delivery of health services. We find that dietary practices of women deteriorated, while that of children remained the same. The deterioration is less among households owning ration cards or having political contacts. The analysis suggests that, during pandemics or similar crisis periods, the need to supplement the supply of staple items through the Public Distribution System with a direct transfer of cash will allow households to maintain diversity in the consumption basket.

AB  - Background
Deaths among tuberculosis patients due to varied causes are frequently reported. Usually, the death rate is high during the first six to eight months, i.e., the intensive phase of treatment. The healthcare personnel working under National Tuberculosis Elimination Program are reluctant to ascribe death to tuberculosis and may prefer to attribute the death to other causes. On the other hand, in hospitals, most death are attributed to tuberculosis without careful death audits and reasonable investigations. Comorbidities like diabetes, HIV, drug resistance, and drug-induced toxicity consequent to administering secondary lines of drugs need due consideration while ascertaining the cause of death. The study aimed to measure mortality within one year and a maximum of two years after registration. We also determined the cause of death by conducting a verbal autopsy by medico-social workers using the WHO modified autopsy tool. Two pairs of physicians ascertained cause of death by reviewing the collected information. We obtained the consensus opinion of a pair of physicians. In case of disputed opinion, opinion of senior physician from the other group was considered final.
Material and methods
We obtained the list of registered tuberculosis patients in 2019–2020 in Pune Municipal Corporation. The authors conducted the study in 2021–22. The authors prepared a verbal autopsy tool based on the WHO tool. We trained the experienced medical social workers. They called registered phone numbers to know the patient's present status. The social workers paid home visits and confirmed the present status if the phone was not connected even after repeated calls. They collected all the required details, reviewed information and decided the cause of death. The collected detailed information was shared with pairs of senior physicians who ascertained the cause of death. We calculated standardized mortality ratio and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
Results
The eligible patients were 7461, and there were 506 deaths. The death rate among males was higher (8.29%) compared to females (5.02%) [χ2 (with Yates correction) = 30.73; p < 0.00001]. The mean age of deceased and living patients was 42.77 (S.D. = 18.07) and 38.46 (S.D. = 17.54) years, respectively (t = 5.33; p < 0.0001). The death rate was 3.88 per 1000 person-months. More than 60% of patients died within six months of initiation of treatment. The overall standardized mortality ratio was 9.61; it decreased as the age advanced. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the overall survival for two years was 92.7%. The common causes were pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, acute coronary syndrome, and some liver injury/disease.
Conclusions
The standardized mortality ratio due to tuberculosis is high. The common causes of death are pneumonia and acute coronary syndrome.

Background
Knowledge of the adverse problems related to SARS-CoV-2 infection in marginalised and deprived groups may help to prioritise more preventive efforts in these groups. We examined adverse outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among vulnerable segments of society.
Methods
Using health and administrative registers, a population-based cohort study of 4.4 million Danes aged at least 15 years from 27 February 2020 to 15 October 2021 was performed. People with 1) low educational level, 2) homelessness, 3) imprisonment, 4) substance abuse, 5) supported psychiatric housing, 6) psychiatric admission, and 7) severe mental illness were main exposure groups. Chronic medical conditions were included for comparison. COVID-19-related outcomes were: 1) hospitalisation, 2) intensive care, 3) 60-day mortality, and 4) overall mortality. PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and PCR-testing were also studied. Poisson regression analysis was used to compute adjusted incidence and mortality rate ratios (IRRs, MRRs).
Findings
Using health and administrative registers, we performed a population-based cohort study of 4,412,382 individuals (mean age 48 years; 51% females). In all, 257,450 (5·8%) individuals had a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. After adjustment for age, calendar time, and sex, we found that especially people experiencing homelessness had high risk of hospitalisation (IRR 4·36, 95% CI, 3·09-6·14), intensive care (IRR 3·12, 95% CI 1·29-7·52), and death (MRR 8·17, 95% CI, 3·66-18·25) compared with people without such experiences, but increased risk was found for all studied groups. Furthermore, after full adjustment, including for status of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection, individuals with experiences of homelessness and a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection had 41-times (95% CI, 24·84-68·44) higher risk of all-cause death during the study period compared with individuals without. Supported psychiatric housing was linked to almost 3-times higher risk of hospitalisation and 60-day mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the general population with other living circumstances.
Interpretation
Socially marginalised and psychiatrically vulnerable individuals had substantially elevated risks of adverse health outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results highlight that pandemic preparedness should address inequalities in health, including infection prevention and vaccination of vulnerable groups.

AB  - Health disparity related to race/ethnicity has been cited as “the most serious and shameful health care issue of our time”(Peterson et al., 2018). A portion of the now recognized disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) communities is attributable to social determinants such as socioeconomic status (SES), physical living situation, health care access, and the psychosocial factors associated with socioenvironmental circumstances such as bias, victimization, trauma and toxic stress as well as structural factors that reduce the capacity to practice physical distancing (Agurs-Collins et al., 2019). In this paper, we hypothesize that, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, disproportionate socio-economic and environmental stressors in the BIPOC population promoted heightened stress-associated neurobiological activity (Stress-NbA). This chronic elevation in Stress-NbA results in down-stream complications of chronic stress including underactivation of anti-viral type I IFN pathway genes. This results in an increase in susceptibility to viral diseases, including coronavirus illnesses. Additionally, Stress-NbA chronically potentiates systemic inflammation (from hematopoietic system activation with myelopoiesis) increasing the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and setting the stage for stress-related chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This process was propelled by overactivation of immune cell gene expression in the nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) activation pathway and underactivation of gene expression in the anti-viral type I interferon (IFN) pathway. The higher prevalence of MetS and NCDs in minority populations turned out to be predictive of the elevated risk they would face in the presence of a highly contagious viral pandemic. The stress-related generation of a chronic non-pathogen associated molecular pattern (non-PAMP) immunoactivation state led to decreased viral immune defense and increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection with increased risk of severe illness induced by cytokine storm syndrome (CSS).

AB  - Mass vaccination against the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was a crucial step in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in 2021. Even in the face of new variants, it still remains extremely important for reducing hospitalizations and COVID-19 deaths. In order to better understand the short- and long-term dynamics of humoral immune response, we present a longitudinal analysis of post-vaccination IgG levels in a cohort of 166 Romanian healthcare workers vaccinated with BNT162b2 with weekly follow-up until 35 days past the first dose and monthly follow-up up to 6 months post-vaccination. A subset of the patients continued with follow-up after 6 months and either received a booster dose or got infected during the Delta wave in Romania. Tests were carried out on 1694 samples using a CE-marked IgG ELISA assay developed in-house, containing S1 and N antigens of the wild type virus. Participants infected with SARS-CoV-2 before vaccination mount a quick immune response, reaching peak IgG levels two weeks after the first dose, while IgG levels of previously uninfected participants mount gradually, increasing abruptly after the second dose. Overall higher IgG levels are maintained for the previously infected group throughout the six month primary observation period (e.g. 36–65 days after the first dose, the median value in the previously infected group is 5.29 AU/ml, versus 3.58 AU/ml in the infection naïve group, p less than 0.001). The decrease of IgG levels is gradual, with lower median values in the infection naïve cohort even 7–8 months after vaccination, compared to the previously infected cohort (0.7 AU/ml versus 1.29 AU/ml, p = 0.006). Administration of a booster dose yielded higher median IgG antibody levels than post second dose in the infection naïve group and comparable levels in the previously infected group.
